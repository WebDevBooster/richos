# updater-setup.test.sh — the UPDATE PATH's configuration, its refusals, and the two
# artifacts, exercised without a release build.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE CAN AND CANNOT PROVE, first, because the distinction is the whole reason
# it exists beside `updater-e2e.sh` rather than instead of it.
#
#   IT PROVES     every refusal in `package-app.sh --updater`, by running it; that the
#                 shipped config is wired the way the plugin needs; that the archive builder
#                 produces something installable and REFUSES the four shapes that are not;
#                 and that the signature verifier verifies a good pair and REFUSES a
#                 tampered one and a wrong-key one. It runs in seconds.
#
#   IT CANNOT     prove that an update applies. That is a claim about a signed .app.tar.gz
#                 replacing a RUNNING bundle, and it is proven by `app/scripts/updater-e2e.sh`,
#                 which builds 0.1.0 and 0.1.1 and makes one become the other on this machine.
#                 Nothing here is a substitute for that, and this header exists so nobody
#                 reads a green run as one.
#
# Cases:
#   A1  --updater with no signing key refuses, and says why there is no fallback
#   A2  --updater with a key path that does not exist refuses
#   A3  --updater with the key INSIDE a git worktree refuses (a leaked updater key cannot
#       be revoked — the public half is compiled into every installed copy)
#   A4  --updater with a world-readable key refuses
#   A5  --updater with a real key, outside a repo, mode 600, RESOLVES
#   A6  ...and says NO MANIFEST when RICHOS_UPDATE_BASE_URL is unset
#   A7  ...and names the URL when it is set
#   B1  tauri.conf.json declares createUpdaterArtifacts
#   B2  ...exactly one endpoint, and it is the GitHub Releases manifest URL over https
#   B3  ...a pubkey that is a decodable minisign public key
#   B4  the webview is granted NO updater permission, and the capability says why
#   B5  the build always passes --no-sign (the bundler would otherwise sign a tarball of an
#       unsigned app, and a keyless build would fail outright)
#   B6  ...and carries no `version`, so src-tauri/Cargo.toml is the one place it is written
#   B7  package-app.sh creates the staged frontend directory, so a clean checkout can build
#   G1  a well-formed manifest VERIFIES with the plugin's own RemoteRelease type
#   G2  ...a manifest with no entry for this platform is REFUSED
#   G3  ...a manifest whose `signature` is not the .sig file beside the archive is REFUSED
#   G4  ...a manifest announcing a URL other than the one the artifact will live at is REFUSED
#   G5  ...an http URL is REFUSED
#   G6  ...a version that is not strictly greater than the installed one is REFUSED
#   C1  the archive builder roots every member at one .app
#   C2  ...preserves the executable bit
#   C3  ...preserves symlinks rather than dereferencing them
#   C4  ...and writes no AppleDouble members
#   D1  `verify` refuses an archive rooted at two different names
#   D2  `verify` refuses an archive with no Info.plist
#   D3  `verify` refuses an archive with an AppleDouble member
#   D4  `verify` refuses an archive with nothing executable in it
#   E1  the signature verifier VERIFIES a good pair against the shipped pubkey
#   E2  ...REFUSES a tampered artifact, and says so as a signature refusal
#   E3  ...REFUSES a correctly-formed signature from a different key
