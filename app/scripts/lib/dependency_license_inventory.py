"""Generate the compiled-dependency license inventory from the tracked lockfiles.

Called by app/scripts/dependency-license-inventory.sh, which is where the
rationale lives. This file is the mechanism.

Usage: dependency_license_inventory.py <repo-root> <out-file> <lockfile>...

Everything it reports comes out of `cargo metadata --locked`, which refuses to
run if a lockfile would have to change. So a document produced by this script
describes the graph the lockfiles pin, or it does not get produced.

THE ONE RULE WORTH KNOWING BEFORE YOU EDIT IT: an SPDX expression this file has
never seen is a hard failure, not a row that quietly says "unknown". A new
dependency arriving under terms nobody reviewed is precisely the event this
inventory exists to catch, and a tool that renders it as an ordinary row has
converted the finding into a line of text.
