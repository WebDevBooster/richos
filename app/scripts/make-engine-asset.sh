# THE ENGINE, AS A RELEASE ASSET — deterministic, digested, and pinned into the build.
#
#   app/scripts/make-engine-asset.sh [--out <dir>] [--tag <release-tag>]
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# `ceo-decisions.md` §19 rules the payload at four files and 8,754,980 B and lists the engine
# directory under "What is NOT bundled". The same day: "Where the download lives: THE PUBLIC
# GITHUB REPO'S RELEASES." The engine is already IN that repository, so it reaches a customer
# as a release asset. This script is the thing that makes that asset, and the digest that makes
# it verifiable.
#
# WHAT GOES IN: WHAT GIT TRACKS, NOT WHAT IS ON THE OPERATOR'S DISK
#
# Until 2026-09-04 this copied the engine WORKING TREE — `tar -cf - .` — so every gitignored
# artifact in `engine/` went into the customer's download. Measured on main that day: 119
# ignored files. Fifteen `.claude/state/agent-definitions-*.snapshot`, each carrying a SESSION
# UUID, a generation timestamp and the operator's absolute home path. 57
# `scripts/hooks/*.sha256` sidecars that `install.sh` re-mints on every run. `__pycache__`
# bytecode. Two defects wearing one coat:
#
#   * THE DIGEST MOVED, because a new session mints a new snapshot. The sha256 compiled into
#     the app was a property of WHEN the build ran, and a customer discovers that as a
#     DigestMismatch. Reproduced: build, one new snapshot file, build — 4fcb8b46... became
#     e30083c5....
#   * SESSION IDENTIFIERS AND A HOME DIRECTORY WERE PUBLISHED. The same class the 2026-09-04
#     shipped-artifact privacy pass removed from the executable, arriving through a different
#     door into a different artifact, with nothing watching that door.
#
# So the source of truth is `git ls-files`, and a file that is not tracked is not in the asset.
# There is deliberately NO exclusion list: an allowlist of harmless ignored files drifts from
# the ignored files that exist, and the next ignored artifact somebody invents has to be
# excluded by construction rather than by having been thought of. Two consequences worth
# stating out loud:
#
#   * OUTSIDE A GIT CHECKOUT THIS REFUSES rather than falling back to copying everything. A
#     silent fallback would be a fallback into the leak, which is the wrong failure direction.
#   * The archive is checked AFTER it is built, against git, by
#     `verify-engine-asset-members.sh` — because determinism catches this only by accident.
#     `--check` caught the snapshot only because the snapshot changed; AN IGNORED FILE THAT
#     NEVER CHANGES PASSES A DETERMINISM CHECK FOREVER. Proven: 205 ignored files planted and
#     left alone, all thirteen cases green, 208 leaked members in the archive.
#
# DETERMINISTIC, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT
#
# The digest is compiled into the app (`RICHOS_ENGINE_SHA256`) and covered by the app's own
# Developer ID signature. That only means anything if building the tarball twice from the same
# tree produces the same bytes. Four things are normalized, each of which otherwise moves:
#
#   * ORDER    — `find | LC_ALL=C sort`, not the filesystem's directory order.
#   * TIME     — every mtime pinned to the engine's own commit time (or 0 outside a checkout).
#   * OWNER    — uid/gid 0, name `root`, via bsdtar's `--uid/--gid/--uname/--gname`.
#   * MODE     — 755 for directories, 755 for anything the source marks user-executable, 644
#                for everything else. See below; this one was found by running the script,
#                not by reading it.
#   * GZIP     — `gzip -n`, because gzip writes the source filename and an mtime into its own
#                header by default, which makes two identical tarballs differ.
#
# MODE, AND WHY IT IS NOT PARANOIA. Measured 2026-09-04, same tree, same machine, same second:
#
#     umask 022  ->  2,021,839 B  sha256 cbee8763588469de4f01f04a8f3aeaec1dc7bb1225327119c51dbdd7ebd7afb2
#     umask 077  ->  2,021,655 B  sha256 fdae7195cf0083426ead2749fb4e3f87678e29c45cf5ac77d7cce3088e073e33
#
# All 531 members differed, and they differed ONLY in mode — 0755 became 0700, 0644 became
# 0600 — because macOS's bsdtar applies the caller's umask when it extracts as a non-root
# user, so the staging copy inherited the umask of whoever happened to run this. The digest
# that gets compiled into the app and checked on a customer's Mac was a function of an
# operator's shell setting. Normalizing here makes the archive a function of CONTENT plus the
# one permission bit git actually tracks, which is the only determinism boundary that can
# hold across two machines.
#
# `--check` runs the whole thing twice and requires the two digests to match — and the second
# run is deliberately made in a DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT (another umask, another TMPDIR, the C
# locale, UTC), because a second build under identical conditions cannot fail for any reason
# the first one would not have failed for. That is exactly how the umask defect above survived
# a green `--check`. A non-deterministic build would otherwise be discovered as a
# DigestMismatch on a customer's Mac, which is the one place it must never be discovered.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
#
# It does not publish, tag, or upload. `gh release upload` is a human's decision and this
# script's output tells them exactly what to run. Nothing here touches the network.
