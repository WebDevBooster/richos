# dependency-license-inventory.sh — the compiled-dependency license inventory,
# derived from the tracked lockfiles rather than typed.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ===========================================================================
# `docs/legal/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` makes a per-package dependency inventory
# a GATE on distributing a RichOS binary. Until 2026-09-04 that gate could not
# be discharged, and the notices file said so in as many words: both
# `Cargo.lock` files were gitignored, so an inventory generated on any given
# morning would have been keyed to whatever versions resolved that morning on
# one machine. The notices file called that "a document that looks like
# evidence", which is exactly right.
#
# The lockfiles are now tracked. This script is the other half: it reads the
# RESOLVED graph — `cargo metadata --locked`, which refuses to run at all if a
# lockfile would have to change — and writes the inventory keyed to the sha256
# of the lockfiles it was generated from.
#
# ===========================================================================
# NOTHING HERE IS TYPED
# ===========================================================================
# The workspace list is not a list. It is every `Cargo.lock` that git tracks,
# discovered with `git ls-files`, because tracked-and-not-ignored is not an
# approximation of what somebody receives — it IS what they receive. Add a
# fourth Rust workspace to this repository and commit its lockfile, and it
# appears here with no edit to this file. That is deliberate: a hand-maintained
# inventory of things to inventory is the defect this repository has already
# paid for several times over.
#
# Per-package license identifiers come from cargo's own metadata, which reads
# each package's manifest out of the registry source it actually resolved to —
# not from a hand-copied table, and not from crates.io at generation time.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT IT CANNOT TELL YOU — said here so nobody has to find out
# ===========================================================================
#   * Whether a declared license is TRUE. A crate that declares MIT while
#     vendoring something else is invisible to every tool of this kind. The
#     declaration is the publisher's claim and this file reproduces it.
#   * Which alternative you chose. Most of this tree is "MIT OR Apache-2.0" —
#     a choice, not a conjunction. The document records the offer; the
#     licensing analysis beside it records what RichOS relies on.
#   * Anything about the ENGINE's own bundled skills, fonts or tools. Those are
#     not compiled dependencies and they live in
#     `docs/legal/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`, which is hand-verified against
#     upstream because provenance is not a thing a resolver knows.
#
# ===========================================================================
# USAGE
# ===========================================================================
#   app/scripts/dependency-license-inventory.sh            # write the document
#   app/scripts/dependency-license-inventory.sh --check    # fail if it is stale
#
# `--check` regenerates into a temporary file and compares. It is the answer to
# "somebody bumped a dependency and the legal document still describes the old
# graph", which is the only way this document can lie.
