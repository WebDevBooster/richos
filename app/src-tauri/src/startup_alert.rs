//! WHAT THE PERSON SEES WHEN RICHOS CANNOT OPEN.
//!
//! =========================================================================================
//! THE DEFECT, IN ONE SENTENCE
//! =========================================================================================
//!
//!     Every way this application can fail before its window exists ended in a line on
//!     stderr, and a Finder or Dock launch has no stderr anybody will ever read.
//!
//! The whole of the user's experience was an icon that bounced once and stopped. Found by
//! `tom-opus-ui1` while auditing the affordance suite at `a8fe95f3`: the nine failure
//! strings reachable from `update_startup::prepare` were classified NOT-RENDERED, because
//! no surface exists that could render them.
//!
//! =========================================================================================
//! THE CLASS, NOT THE INSTANCE — TWELVE SITES, THREE SHAPES
//! =========================================================================================
//!
//! `prepare`'s `eprintln! + return` was the reported one. Repairing only that would leave
//! eleven siblings, so the enumeration is written down here and the fix is aimed at the
//! shape rather than at any member:
//!
//!   SHAPE 1 — an explicit early return, before Tauri exists at all (2 sites)
//!     main.rs:898-904   `update_startup::prepare` -> Err -> eprintln + `return`   <- reported
//!     main.rs:906-914   `--onboarding-mcp` -> Err -> eprintln + `exit(1)`
//!
//!   SHAPE 2 — a panic inside `setup`, which never reaches a usable window (4 sites)
//!     main.rs:1020      `LaunchStore::open(...).expect("open launch record")`   (pre-window)
//!     main.rs:1101      `Ledger::open(...).expect("open ledger")`
//!     main.rs:1138      `ConfigStore::open(...).expect("open config store")`
//!     main.rs:1256      `ensure_active_thread_in(...).expect("ensure thread")`
//!
//!   SHAPE 3 — `?` out of `setup`, or the builder itself (3 sites)
//!     main.rs:1035      `WebviewWindowBuilder::from_config(...)?`
//!     main.rs:1066      `.build()?`
//!     main.rs:1938      `.build(context).expect("error while building RichOS")`
//!
//!   And the three `.lock().expect(...)` sites in `updates.rs` (246, 327, 435/450/499/667/721
//!   are the same poisoned-mutex shape) reach the same hook once armed, because SHAPE 2 and
//!   SHAPE 3 are both *panics* and are caught in one place.
//!
//! SHAPE 2 and SHAPE 3 are ONE mechanism — a Rust panic unwinds `main`, the process exits
//! 101, and macOS shows nothing for a clean non-zero exit. Only SHAPE 1 needed a call site.
//! That is why the fix is a panic hook plus one function, and not twelve edits: a thirteenth
//! site added next month is covered without anybody remembering this file exists.
//!
//! `updates.rs:858`'s `std::process::exit(code)` is deliberately NOT in the class. It is the
//! `RICHOS_UPDATE_SELFTEST` harness's own exit, reached only when that variable is set, and
//! its audience is `app/scripts/updater-e2e.sh`'s stdout parser.
//!
//! =========================================================================================
//! WHAT WAS CHOSEN, AND WHAT WAS REJECTED
//! =========================================================================================
//!
//! CHOSEN: `CFUserNotificationDisplayAlert` — CoreFoundation, in-process, no new crate.
//!
//! It is the API macOS provides for exactly this position: a process that must speak to the
//! person at the machine before (or without) becoming a GUI application. It needs no
//! `NSApplication`, no run loop, no window server handshake of our own, and no subprocess.
//!
//! MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED, on this machine (Darwin 24.6.0) on 2026-09-10 before a line of
//! this file was written: a 12-line C probe calling it with a 12-second timeout put a real
//! system alert on screen — stop-sign icon, header, message, OK button — and returned
//! `rc=0 resp=3` (`kCFUserNotificationCancelResponse`, which is what a timeout returns).
//! Screenshot and probe source: `docs/verification/startup-alert-2026-09-10/`.
//!
//! REJECTED, each for a reason and not for taste:
//!
//!   * A TAURI ERROR WINDOW. It would require initializing the runtime whose prerequisite
//!     has just failed. Worse, it is specifically wrong for these failures: two of
//!     `prepare`'s errors — "Update activation needs recovery before the app can start" and
//!     "The activated application could not start" — mean the bundle under this loaded image
//!     may already have been exchanged. Running the whole webview stack against resources
//!     the code has just refused to trust is the thing `update_startup.rs:90-92` exists to
//!     prevent.
//!   * `osascript -e 'display alert ...'`. It works, and it forks a subprocess into the
//!     AppleScript stack at the one moment this process's environment is known to be broken.
//!     It also requires interpolating an arbitrary error string into an AppleScript literal;
//!     CoreFoundation takes the message as DATA and cannot be made to run it.
//!   * `NSAlert` through objc. Needs `NSApplication.shared` and a run loop — which is
//!     precisely what has not happened yet — and adds an objc dependency.
//!   * `rfd` / `tauri-plugin-dialog`. A new dependency in the one code path whose entire job
//!     is to work when other things are broken. `rfd`'s macOS backend is `NSAlert`, so it
//!     inherits the objection above as well.
//!   * A NOTIFICATION (`UNUserNotificationCenter`). Requires authorization the app may never
//!     have been granted, is silently dropped in a Focus mode, and is dismissible into a
//!     history the person does not know to open. A failure to start is not a notification.
//!   * STDERR PLUS "CHECK THE LOG". The status quo, and the defect.
//!
//! NOT macOS: `prepare` is `Ok(None)` off macOS and RichOS ships macOS only, so the alert
//! arm here is macOS only and every other platform gets the log plus stderr. THIS IS A
//! DECLARED GAP, NOT A FINISHED PORT — the Windows equivalent is `MessageBoxW` from
//! `user32` with `MB_ICONERROR | MB_SETFOREGROUND`, which has the same "works before any
//! window exists" property. It is NOT written here because it cannot be compiled on this
//! machine (`rustup target list --installed` reports `aarch64-apple-darwin` and nothing
//! else, measured 2026-09-10), and untested FFI in the failure path is worth less than an
//! honest gap. It sits with the other two open Windows items in the architecture doc §4.4
//! gap 5 (no Windows code-signing certificate) and §3.3 (WebView2 vs WebKit).
//!
//! =========================================================================================
//! WHEN THE ALERT IS ARMED — THE PROJECT'S OWN RULE, REUSED, NOT A SECOND ONE
//! =========================================================================================
//!
//! A modal alert on every failing boot would hang `gui-boot.test.sh`, `updater-e2e.sh` and
//! every harness written after them. The obvious fix is to detect a test — and `activation.rs`
//! already argues at length why that is the wrong shape and keeps the inverse rule instead:
//! B (in this build's own bundle), D (writing to the installed data directory), P (parent pid
//! is 1, because macOS hands a launch to launchd and a harness must hold what it boots).
//!
//! So the alert is armed by EXACTLY `activation::decide(...) == Presentation::Regular` and by
//! nothing else. A harness cannot be an installed launch by construction, so it never sees a
//! modal, and nobody has to add it to a list. The person double-clicking in Finder always is.
//!
//! Armed TWICE, deliberately, because the two moments know different amounts:
//!
//!   * `install()` runs before Tauri and can only approximate D — it computes the data
//!     directory Tauri's macOS `app_data_dir()` will return rather than reading it. B and P
//!     are exact there, and P is the condition that actually holds a harness out.
//!   * `rearm()` runs in `setup` from the AUTHORITATIVE decision, against the `data_dir` the
//!     boot really resolved. From that line on, the approximation is gone.
//!
//! And DISARMED at `boot complete`. After that the app owns a window and its own surfaces are
//! the right place for a failure; a modal system alert raised by a background thread that
//! panicked would be an interruption, not a rescue.
//!
//! =========================================================================================
//! THE DIAGNOSTIC IS NEVER TRADED FOR THE FRIENDLY SENTENCE
//! =========================================================================================
//!
//! Every report writes THREE ways and drops none of them:
//!
//!   1. `~/Library/Logs/RichOS/startup.log` — timestamped, with the version, the pid and the
//!      executable path. `~/Library/Logs` is where Console.app looks, so it is a place a
//!      person can be sent and an engineer can read.
//!   2. stderr, unchanged, still prefixed `[richos] ` so `gui-boot.test.sh`'s S1 accounting
//!      still sees it.
//!   3. the alert, which NAMES THE LOG'S PATH in its own text and offers a button that
//!      reveals the file in Finder.
//!
//! A panic keeps its default hook as well, so the payload, the location and any
//! `RUST_BACKTRACE` output still go to stderr exactly as they did before this file existed.
