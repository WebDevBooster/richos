//! COMPANY MEMORY AT BOOT, AND AGAIN THE MOMENT THE CEO SETS IT UP.
//!
//! Everything in [`wire_company_memory`] lived inside `setup` until 2026-09-01, ran exactly
//! once, and printed the boot line. It moved here **unchanged** because first-run
//! provisioning has to run it a second time: the CEO answers "set my memory up", a corpus
//! appears on disk, and the app must start using it without being relaunched. Two copies of
//! this logic would drift, and the copy that drifted would be the one he actually hits.
//!
//! What this file adds on top of that move is [`MemoryStatus`] — the four outcomes the boot
//! log already distinguished, as a value the window can read, so the first-run question is
//! asked from the same fact the log states rather than from a second guess about it.
