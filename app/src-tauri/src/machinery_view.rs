//! The body of `get_machinery` — techy mode's read path (techy-mode design §3.4).
//!
//! In its own file for the same reason `timeline_view.rs` is: an example can include THIS
//! source by path and print the exact JSON the webview receives, so a payload proof cannot
//! drift from the command by re-implementing it.
//!
//! ## Why this is a SECOND command and not a mode argument on `get_timeline`
//! `timeline_view.rs` carries the CEO gate as a property nobody can route around: it calls
//! `view(ViewMode::Ceo)` and `Timeline` does not implement `Serialize`, so that function
//! never holds a raw command, a file path or an internal item. Adding a `mode` parameter
//! to it would trade that structural fact for a branch — and the calm path would then be
//! one wrong argument away from serving technical bytes. So the calm command is untouched,
//! byte for byte, and technical mode arrives through its own door.
//!
//! `ViewMode::Technical` still cannot reach an `Internal` item: `Visibility::renders_in`
//! is false for `Internal` in EVERY mode, and there is deliberately no `ViewMode::Internal`
//! to ask for (timeline.rs). Re-prime traffic, rotation machinery and model reasoning have
//! no render path here either.
//!
//! ## What it does NOT carry, and why
//! No raw payloads. §2.4 caps one payload at 32 KB and a working thread holds hundreds of
//! records, so shipping every raw blob on every thread open would put megabytes through
//! the IPC boundary to render a column of one-line rows. The raw pane is a second command
//! (`get_machinery_raw`), fetched when the CEO actually expands a row.
