/// Gate on the app icons BEFORE Tauri's own build step, so a placeholder icon set is
/// caught with a clear, actionable message instead of quietly shipping a blank/wrong
/// icon (macOS: `.app` with no icon at any size; Windows: exe/installer with no icon at
/// all — both launch-blocking for a product the CEO installs on his own machine).
///
/// THE DEFECT THIS REPLACES: all four files under `icons/` were byte-identical 2200-byte
/// placeholders, each internally a 512x512 PNG regardless of what its filename claimed.
///
/// THE DEFECT *THIS REWRITE* REPLACES: the previous version of this gate hand-typed a
/// list of four filenames while `tauri.conf.json` declared six, so `icon.icns` and
/// `icon.ico` — the only two artefacts that actually carry the icon on macOS and Windows
/// — were never checked at all. A check that describes something narrower than it claims
/// to is worse than no check, because it buys false confidence. So this version derives
/// the required set from `tauri.conf.json`'s `bundle.icon` array: Tauri's own list of
/// what it bundles. Adding a size there cannot leave this check silently passing, and an
/// entry we cannot decode is a failure rather than a skip.
///
/// `app/scripts/lib/app_icons.py` derives the SAME requirements INDEPENDENTLY from the
/// SAME config. That duplication is deliberate — two independent readers agreeing is a
/// stronger guarantee than one shared helper, and if the generator's derivation ever
/// drifts from this one, the build says so.
