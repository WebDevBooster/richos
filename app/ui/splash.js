// THE OPENING SCREEN — the renderer, and the only code in this feature.
//
// It runs at the very top of <body>, synchronously, so the composition is part of the
// window's FIRST paint rather than something that arrives after it. Everything below is
// pure DOM construction against `splash.css`'s structure; the values all come from one
// entry in `splash-library.js`.
//
// THE ONE CONSTRAINT ABOVE ALL OTHERS: this never delays launch by a frame. It cannot,
// structurally, and the structure is the argument -
//
//   * it adds no `await` to `main.js`'s boot path. `main.js` calls exactly one function
//     from this file, `RichSplash.yieldNow()`, and calls it at the point its own comment
//     already calls "the app is usable";
//   * it does no I/O, reads no file, and awaits no command before painting. The setting it
//     needs is read synchronously out of `localStorage` - the same instant-local-cache
//     pattern `main.js` already uses for the assertiveness dial, for the same reason, with
//     the Rust `ConfigStore` as the durable source of truth reconciled afterwards;
//   * the curtain is `pointer-events: none` for its whole life, so the live app underneath
//     is reachable the moment it is live;
//   * and it gets out of the way on the FIRST of three signals - the app reporting ready,
//     the CEO touching a key or the trackpad, or a hard ceiling - so no failure anywhere
//     else in the shell can leave it up.
//
// THE HONEST STATES. If the switch is off, if the library is missing, unparseable or
// empty, if every entry in it is malformed, or if anything at all throws while drawing,
// the result is the same and it is deliberate: NO SPLASH, and a completely normal launch.
// Never a half-drawn frame, never a fallback that looks like a broken app. `removeSelf()`
// below is what makes a partial build leave nothing behind.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE, named rather than hidden: tier 2 (a true line about his record) and
// tier 3 (hallmarks) from `richos-splash-micro-game-2026-08-30.md`. Both wait on CEO
// answers to that document's §8. Their seams are marked in `splash.css` - the slot under
// the rule, and the plinth's inner keyline - and neither needs this file redesigned.

  //
  // CEO, 2026-08-31: "The splash screen is only for when the user starts the app fresh
  // (after quitting." So a fresh launch draws; a crash-restart and a second window do not,
  // and neither is counted as a start. Waking from sleep is not in the list because he
  // struck the category - the app was never quit, so nothing begins and no code here runs.
  //
  // The verdict arrives as a frozen object the shell injects BEFORE any of this page's own
  // scripts (`main.rs`'s `launch_init_script`, via `WebviewWindowBuilder`). It has to: this
  // file decides whether to draw on its first synchronous line, and a splash that appeared
  // on a crash-restart because the answer arrived one tick late would be the wrong ceremony
  // at the worst possible moment - the app just died in front of him.
  //
  // ABSENT MEANS FRESH, and that is the same rule the switch above already follows: an
  // absent value is an absent opinion, not a decision. Nobody having told us how this page
  // came up covers a webview the shell could not inject into, `index.html` opened straight
  // off disk, and the acceptance harness - and every one of those genuinely IS a fresh
  // start of the thing being looked at. The alternative default would make a shell bug or a

  // mat is.

  // is it: A TRACK CARRYING A STACK OF PAINT LAYERS, SOME OF WHOSE WIDTHS FOLLOW THE

  // TWO FILLS.

  // entries: point `--splash-signal` at `t.ink` and every screen goes monochrome at once.

  // WHICH SCREEN HE SEES, AND IT IS NOT A DRAW
  //
  // CEO, 2026-09-01, verbatim: *"USE THE APPROVED SPLASH SCREEN #1 to always
  // deterministically show as SPLASH SCREEN #1 and splash screen #2 to always show as splash
  // screen for the SECOND APP START in RichOS v1. From the third app start onwards: Only
  // splash screen #1. For NOW == app version 1."*
  //
  //     start 1        -> #1
  //     start 2        -> #2
  //     start 3 and on -> #1
  //
  // THIS REPLACED A RANDOM DRAW. Until this commit the surface picked uniformly out of the
  // library with a no-immediate-repeat guard, which is the mechanism his LATER framing asks
  // for - *"eventually, there will be many splash screens added to the array where the splash
  // screen will be randomly picked for the user (and sometimes semi-randomly or
  // deterministically picked for a user based on certain criteria)"* - and is not what he
  // asked for in v1. `KEY_LAST`, the no-repeat guard's storage, went with it: a deterministic
  // rule has nothing to remember.
  //
  // WHERE THE LATER CRITERIA ATTACH: this function, and only this function. It already takes
  // the whole pool and the ordinal; a criteria-driven pick takes the same two arguments plus
  // whatever the criterion reads, and nothing else in this file changes. The pool is an
  // ARRAY and the rule reads its length, so a third screen is a third object in the library.
  //
  // A LIBRARY OF ONE gets that one every time, which is the only honest answer: a rule that
  // says "the second start shows the second screen" cannot be applied where there is no
  // second screen, and refusing to draw would be a worse answer than drawing #1 twice.
