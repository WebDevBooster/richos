// THE FEEDBACK CHANNEL, criterion by criterion — RICH-TODOs row 5.
//
// The row read as if nothing existed. At `aa364ed` the module was COMPLETE — the CEO's
// wording in constants, the four keys, `Rating::invites_report`, the versioned taxonomy, the
// one-file store, the disclosure, and four tests asserting there is no way off this machine
// — and `grep -rn feedback app/ui/main.js` returned nothing. The defect was the caller, not
// the core, which is exactly the shape rows 5b, 5c and 5d closed the same day.
//
// So this suite is not about "the panel renders". It is about the CEO's two constraints:
//
//   1. NOTHING SENDS ANYTHING. Held by `tests/feedback_no_outbound_tests.rs`, which now
//      reads this surface's code as well as the module's. This file's job is the other one.
//   2. HE SEES EXACTLY WHAT HIS RICHOS WOULD SAY, BEFORE ANY OF IT COULD EVER TRAVEL.
//      Checks 5, 6 and 7 are that constraint: the block on screen is compared byte for byte
//      against what the RUST renderer produces (read off a fixture a cargo test regenerates
//      from the live types), the approval carries that same block back, and the command
//      REFUSES an approval whose text is not what this build would say.
//
// NOTHING HERE IS ASSERTED AGAINST A HAND-WRITTEN COPY WHERE THE REAL THING CAN BE READ OFF
// DISK. The wording and the vocabulary come from `fixtures/feedback-vocabulary.json`, the
// rendered blocks from `fixtures/feedback-previews.json` and the stored shapes from
// `fixtures/feedback-entries.json` — all three written by
// `crates/richos-core/tests/feedback_surface_tests.rs` from the live constants and the live
// renderer. The store-unavailable sentence is compared to the `const` in `main.rs`. The
// outcome of every click is read back out of `mock.js`'s own store rather than inferred from
// the DOM, and check 2b checks the mock against the Rust constants in turn, so the chain has no
// free end.
//
// EVERY CHECK HERE WAS RUN RED ONCE by breaking the shipped source; the mutations are listed
// against their check numbers at the bottom of this file.
//
// Run: node feedback.js   (or `npm test` for every suite in this directory)
//      RICHOS_PLAYWRIGHT=/path/to/node_modules/playwright node feedback.js

// docs/verification/feedback-channel-2026-08-30/mutation-runs.txt — 25 runs, one edit each
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//  1   index.html: add a `<span class="rail-count">` inside #nav-feedback
//        -> the control promises something is waiting, and nothing on it ever is
//  2   main.js `renderFeedback`: question.textContent = "How are we doing?"
//        -> the surface paraphrases PROMPT_QUESTION, which is the paraphrase the module
//           holds its wording in constants to prevent
//  2b  mock.js: Occurrences "once" -> "one time"
//        -> the preview harness rehearses a term label the product does not use
//  3   main.js `answerFeedback`: offer text = "Can we tell the developers?"
//        -> REPORT_OFFER paraphrased, on the one screen where wording is the product
//  3b  main.js `renderFeedbackKeys`: answerFeedback(r.key, true) for every rating
//        -> a 3 is offered a report `with_report` would refuse
//  3c  main.js: the dismiss button sets phase = "answered" and records nothing
//        -> 0 becomes a way of closing the panel, and the dismissal is lost
//  4   main.js `renderFeedbackChoose`: drop the contributing-condition group
//        -> a whole term type is missing from the choice. Turns FIVE checks red, because
//           the reference selection can no longer be made at all — which is the right
//           answer and the reason it is listed here rather than treated as noise
//  4b  main.js `syncFeedbackChoice`: btn.disabled = false
//        -> the preview is offered over a selection the assembler will refuse
//  5   main.js `showFeedbackPreview`: preview.textContent = rendered.full
//        -> the heading is rendered twice and the block on screen stops being the block
//           the approval carries
//  5   style.css: restore max-height: 240px on #feedback-preview
//        -> the last two lines of the report sit below the fold of a nested scroller, and
//           "he sees exactly what would be said" quietly becomes "most of it"
//  5b  mock.js `feedbackAssemble`: drop the sort from generic_diagnosis
//        -> BAD MUTATION ON THE FIRST ATTEMPT, and the check was strengthened rather than
//           the mutation abandoned: 5b stayed GREEN, because `chosen()` reads
//           `querySelectorAll(:checked)` and gets DOM order whatever order he clicked in.
//           The check now also POSTS the reversed selection through the bridge, which is
//           the only path that reaches the assembler, and the mutation turns it red
//  5c  mock.js `feedbackRender`: emit contributing_condition unconditionally
//        -> an empty list renders as a key with nothing under it
//  6   main.js: approve posts { decision: "declined" }
//        -> he says yes and nothing is recorded
//  6b  main.js: refuse posts the approval
//        -> he says no and the report is recorded anyway
//  7   mock.js `feedback_record`: `if (false)` on the shown-text comparison
//        -> consent recorded for text he was never shown, which is the one failure this
//           whole feature is arranged to make impossible
//  7b  mock.js `feedbackOutcome`: return { kind: "dismissed" } for any key
//        -> an unrecognised key is silently recorded as an answer nobody gave
//  8   main.js `renderFeedback`: feedback-keys.hidden = false
//        -> the four keys are offered over a store that cannot keep an answer
//  8   mock.js: one word of FEEDBACK_STORE_ABSENT changed
//        -> the harness rehearses a sentence the product does not say
//  8b  main.js `refreshFeedback`: `if (false) feedback.historyFailed = String(e);`
//        -> a transient read failure is reported as an uninstalled feature, and the retry
//           disappears with it. Written as `if (false)` deliberately: replacing the line
//           outright would orphan the `else` beneath it and turn every check red, which
//           proves nothing about this one
//  8c  index.html: shorten the empty line to "Nothing is recorded here yet."
//        -> an empty history reads as "you had nothing to say" rather than "nothing has
//           ever asked you"
//  9   main.js `renderFeedbackEntry`: `else if (true)` on the approved branch
//        -> a row with no report is shown carrying one
//  10  main.js `recordFeedback`: replace the catch body with console.error(e)
//        -> the refusal dies in the console, which is the rule affordances.js enforces
//  11  style.css `.desk-body`: overflow-y: hidden
//        -> forty answers with no way to reach the fortieth
//  12  main.js: drop closeFeedback() from the Escape chain
//        -> the panel cannot be dismissed from the keyboard. Also turns 3c red, which uses
//           Escape to prove that closing the panel records nothing
//  13  main.rs: remove feedback_history from generate_handler!
//        -> a registered command disappears and nothing notices
