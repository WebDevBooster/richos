// THE FIRST-RUN NOTICE — the offer he can SEE, and the two answers it can take.
//
// WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS. `docs/verification/onboarding-honesty-2026-09-06/` measured the
// bootstrap interview being offered — inside a REPLY (cell D1), which requires him to type
// something first and to read what comes back. Its own "What is NOT built" list names the
// consequence: *"Rich makes the offer in conversation; a CEO who does not read the first reply
// never sees it."* Driven on the shipping shell, what a first-run user lands on after the
// three setup dialogs is an empty conversation pane. Nothing on it says RichOS knows nothing
// about his business, that there is a twenty-minute interview, or that he may decline.
//
// WHAT IT HOLDS, and each is a clause of the contract rather than a nicety:
//
//   1. THE OFFER IS ON SCREEN WITHOUT HIM TYPING ANYTHING, and it is not on screen for an
//      install that has been described. A surface that painted in both states would be one
//      nobody could turn off.
//   2. "NOT NOW" REACHES DISK. The command is issued, and its ARGUMENTS and its call count are
//      read rather than inferred from what changed on screen — `record_declination` shipped
//      with no caller at all, so "the panel closed" is exactly the evidence that would have
//      passed over the defect this closes.
//   3. A REFUSED WRITE KEEPS THE NOTICE OPEN AND SAYS SO. Closing it over a failed write is
//      reporting success over work that did not happen.
//   4. "START" PUTS A REAL TURN IN THE CONVERSATION, through the same `send()` the composer
//      uses. There is no private route into the interview for a second thing to drift from.
//   5. THE UNUSABLE STATE DRAWS NO BUTTON, because no button could fix it, and its sentences
//      come from Rust rather than from this window.
//   6. NO SENTENCE ON THIS SURFACE PROMISES WHAT THE CHAIN DOES NOT DO — no staffing, and
//      nothing about his own data appearing on the home screen.
//   7. THE MOCK'S COPIES OF THE BACKEND'S SENTENCES STILL MATCH `main.rs`.
//   8. TYPE AND CONTRAST FLOORS on every line of it, computed in the page in both themes.
//
// Run: node onboarding.js   (or `npm test` for every suite in this directory)

//
//  1   main.js `renderFirstRunNotice`: `box.hidden = true; return;` before the branch
//        -> the offer is invisible again, which is the defect this closes.
//           RED as "only 6 assertions ran, floor is 40" — the assertion floor caught it
//           before any single check did, which is what that floor is for.
//  1b  main.js `renderFirstRunNotice`: the `state !== "not-yet"` guard replaced by `false`
//        -> a described install is offered an interview about material it is already using.
//           RED on check 1b.
//  2   main.js `declineFirstRunInterview`: the invoke no longer awaited
//        -> the panel says it was recorded before anything is written. RED on CHECK 3, not
//           check 2 — the un-awaited promise cannot reject into the catch, so what breaks is
//           the refusal arm. Worth writing down: check 2 alone would have passed this, and
//           `record_declination` spent a day with no caller at all.
//  3   main.js `declineFirstRunInterview`: catch closes the notice instead of reporting
//        -> a failed write reads as success. RED on check 3.
//  4   main.js `startFirstRunInterview`: fills the composer and never calls `send()`
//        -> the acceptance sits in the box and no turn reaches the record. RED on check 4.
//  5   main.js: `first-run-actions` left visible in the `unusable` arm
//        -> a button for a thing no button can do. RED on check 5.
//  6   main.js FIRST_RUN_BODY: "and hire the team you describe"
//        -> a promise the chain cannot keep, which is the CEO's own stated blocker on this
//           work. RED on check 6.
//  7   main.rs ONBOARDING_DECLINE_REFUSED: "write that down" -> "save that", mock untouched
//        -> the window rehearses a sentence the product no longer raises. RED on check 7.
//  8   style.css `.first-run-consequence`: 0.875rem and `--ink-faint`
//        -> 14px under a 16px floor, and the effect of a control in the skippable tier.
//           RED on check 8.
