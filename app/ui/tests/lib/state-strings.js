// DERIVE THE USER-VISIBLE STATE INVENTORY FROM SOURCE. NEVER TYPE IT.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
// ====================
// The rule this module serves: *a state the user could change must be rendered together
// with the control that changes it. A state change requiring a human action is not a
// status, it is a request.*
//
// Enforcing that rule needs an INVENTORY of the states the app can show, and the one thing
// an inventory must never be is hand-written. A typed list of 14 against a registration of
// 15 is the defect that opened this whole sequence; `run.js` beside this file lost a whole
// suite the same way; the engine's `run-all-tests.sh` lost five. So the inventory here is
// scraped out of the shipped source every time the suite runs, and the classification
// registry is checked AGAINST it — source is the authority, the registry is the annotation.
//
// HOW THE SCRAPE WORKS
// ====================
// Two extractors, both purely lexical, both deliberately dumb:
//
//   HTML  every non-empty text node outside <script>/<style>/comments, plus the
//         `placeholder`, `title` and `aria-label` attribute values.
//   JS    every string literal (single, double, template) that survives comment stripping,
//         filtered by `looksLikeProse` below.
//
// Comment stripping is a real character scanner (strings, template literals, line and block
// comments, and regex literals via the standard prev-significant-token heuristic), because
// this source is roughly 40% prose commentary and a naive regex would harvest all of it.
//
// THE BLIND SPOTS, NAMED RATHER THAN GLOSSED — each one is text a reader could see that
// this scrape does not produce a literal for:
//
//   B1. COMPOSED strings. `"Working for " + d` yields the literal `Working for ` and never
//       the rendered `Working for 4m 7s`. The state is SEEN; its rendered form is not.
//   B2. BACKEND-AUTHORED strings. `showUnboundView` prints `navTree.unbound_explanation`
//       and `String(e)` — text minted in Rust and relayed verbatim. Covered by the
//       separate `rustStrings()` scrape below, which greps the Rust sources that feed
//       those fields and is therefore weaker than the JS one.
//   B3. Strings under the prose floor. "Rich", "Copied", "Show more" are real UI text and
//       are deliberately excluded: they are labels ON controls, not states, and including
//       them buries the states in nouns.
//   B4. The `preview-data` files — `mock.js` and `home/field-data.js`. Their strings are
//       SEEDED SAMPLE CONTENT for the browser preview, not states the product can enter.
//       Scanned separately and reported, never mixed in. WHICH files those are is not
//       decided here: `lib/ui-sources.js` classifies every shipped file and reconciles the
//       classification against the tree in both directions.
//   B6. GLSL. `home/field-engine.js` carries its vertex and fragment shaders as string
//       literals, and a shader is three hundred characters of `vec4`, `uniform` and
//       `gl_FragColor` that clears every prose test written for English. It is code the GPU
//       reads, never text a person reads, so `looksLikeShader` below drops it — and drops
//       it BY SHAPE (a `void main()` or a `gl_` symbol), not by file name, so a shader that
//       moves to another file is still excluded and a sentence that moves INTO this one is
//       still caught.
//   B5. UNBOUNDED MACHINERY LEAK. `send()` prints `String(e)` from `send_message` into the
//       timeline. If the failure came from inside richos-core rather than from the command
//       layer's own authored refusal, that text is a Display impl — "cognition io: broken
//       pipe", "the loro slice did not parse". Any error in the crate can reach that
//       sentence, so the set is not enumerable and this module does not pretend to
//       enumerate it. Reported as a finding, not folded into the inventory.
//
// A blind spot that is named is a bounded gap. A blind spot that is quietly omitted is the
// defect this module exists to stop.

///   2. The `Err(String)` of a `#[tauri::command]`, and the `const … : &str` those errors
///      are built from. `main.js` relays those verbatim: `String(e)` into the local notice
///      (`send()`), into `#composer-blocked` (`create_thread_in`) and into
///      `#unbound-view-detail` (`loadTimeline`). So a sentence written beside `Err(` or
///      `ok_or` in a command is a sentence the CEO can read.
///

/// BOTH of the two worst states in the app — "I'm not connected to my thinking right now"
