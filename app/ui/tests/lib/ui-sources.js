// THE SHIPPED-SOURCE MANIFEST, DERIVED FROM THE TREE. NEVER TYPED.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
// ====================
// Three gates in this directory each carried their own hand-written list of which files in
// `app/ui/` they look at, and every one of those lists had gone stale:
//
//   lib/state-strings.js  `UI_SOURCES = ["index.html", "main.js", "timeline.js"]`
//                         against nine `<script src>` tags in index.html. So the affordance
//                         rule — "every ACTIONABLE state names a control" — could not see
//                         `updates.js`, the surface the CEO ruled on the day it was found,
//                         nor `home.js`, `settings-button.js`, `splash.js`,
//                         `splash-library.js` or `theme-boot.js`.
//   tests/contrast.js     `SOURCE_FILES` = four of them, so check 12's exemption inventory
//                         could not see a `data-contrast-exempt` declared in the other five;
//                         `CSS_FILES` = two of the three linked stylesheets, missing the
//                         53 KB `home.css` entirely.
//
// The file that held the worst of them opens with the words "DERIVE THE USER-VISIBLE STATE
// INVENTORY FROM SOURCE. NEVER TYPE IT." A typed list under that header is not an oversight;
// it is the proof that a rule written as a sentence does not survive contact with a second
// author. So the lists are gone and this is the derivation that replaced them.
//
// HOW THE DERIVATION WORKS — THREE STEPS, ALL OFF DISK
// ===================================================
//   1. ENTRY.    `index.html` is the shell Tauri loads. Its `<script src>` and
//                `<link rel=stylesheet href>` tags, read out of the markup with comments
//                stripped, are the first generation.
//   2. CLOSURE.  Every JS file already in the set is scanned for string literals naming an
//                existing file under `app/ui/`, and those are added, repeatedly, until the
//                set stops growing. This is what reaches `home/field-*.js`: they are in no
//                script tag, they are loaded at runtime from `home.js:56`'s `FIELD` array,
//                and a manifest built only from `index.html` would have been a shorter list
//                that LOOKED derived. It is four more files than the nine `ls app/ui/*.js`
//                reports.
//   3. RECONCILE. Every `.js`/`.css`/`.html` file that actually exists under `app/ui/`
//                (`tests/` and `node_modules/` excluded — they do not ship) must be in the
//                closure. One that is not throws BY NAME. A file nobody loads is either a
//                gate's blind spot or dead weight in the bundle, and both are worth a
//                failure rather than a silent skip.
//
// THE ONE DECLARED LIST, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE DEFECT AGAIN
// ========================================================
// `ROLES` below classifies each discovered file. It is written down, because "is this file
// seeded preview data or is it product?" is a judgment no scanner can make. What stops it
// rotting is that it is RECONCILED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS against the derivation, every run:
//
//   * a discovered file with no role      -> throws, naming the file
//   * a role for a file nobody discovers  -> throws, naming the role
//
// So the list cannot be short (step 3 plus the first rule) and it cannot be stale (the
// second). That is the difference between a list that IS the inventory — the defect — and a
// list that is checked against one.
//
// RUN IT:  node lib/ui-sources.js     — prints the manifest and the reconciliation.

// ASKING A QUESTION OF THE WHOLE SHIPPED UI
// =========================================================================================
//
// The manifest above fixed WHICH FILES a gate reads. It did not fix the second half of the
// same defect, and five checks in this directory still carried it: a claim written about
// "the shipped source" and evaluated against `main.js` alone.
//
//   setup.js:351     "there is exactly one run_setup call site in the shipped source"
//   memory.js:310    "there is exactly one call site" (provision_memory)
//   memory.js:329    "main.js must not contain a corpus path"
//   feedback.js:197  no timer may open the feedback desk
//   splash.js:1727   "a measurement timestamp reached the UI"
//
// Every one of those is an ABSENCE or a UNIQUENESS claim, and both of those go green over a
// file they cannot open. A second `invoke("run_setup")` written into `updates.js` leaves
// setup.js check 10 printing "one call site" — and its own comment says why that matters:
// "A SECOND DOOR IS A SECOND PLACE FOR THE GUARD TO BE MISSING." The door it was watching
// was one of twelve.
//
// So the derivation is offered as a QUESTION rather than as a list. `uiMatches(re)` runs a
// pattern over every `role: "ui"` file the manifest reaches and returns `file:line` for
// every hit. A caller cannot accidentally scope it to one file, because there is no file
// argument to pass.
//
// COMMENTS ARE STRIPPED, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING RATHER THAN TIDY. `setup.js:497` already
// hand-rolled a line-based `//` filter for exactly one reason, written at the line: "The
// note above the (absent) listener quotes the line it replaced, so a naive grep matches the
// explanation and calls it the defect." That is true of every file in this product — this
// codebase writes long comments that quote the code they removed — so an absence claim that
// reads comments is a false-positive generator, and the fix belongs here once rather than
// once per caller.

/// Comments removed, LINE NUMBERS PRESERVED, from JavaScript.
///
/// `opts.strings` (default true) keeps string and template bodies. `run.js` needs them GONE
/// — it counts `run.check(` and a `"run.check("` inside a literal is not a call — while an
/// absence claim needs them KEPT, because `invoke("run_setup")` is a string. One scanner and
/// one flag, so the two consumers cannot drift, and `run.js` self-tests it on every run
/// against a fixture carrying all four shapes a naive `grep -c` gets wrong.
///
