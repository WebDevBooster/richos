// THE MESSAGE A STRANGER READS WHEN THE GATE CLOSES THEIR WORK, AND THE FILE THAT CLAIMS TO
// BE A PHOTOGRAPH OF IT.
//
// `docs/verification/pr-trust-gate-2026-09-05/raw/close-comment-rendered.md` records the exact
// comment `.github/workflows/vouch-pr.yml` posts to an unapproved contributor before closing
// their pull request. The LIVE text is not in that file. It is a heredoc inside the workflow:
//
//     cat > "${RUNNER_TEMP}/unvouched-pr.md" <<'MESSAGE'
//     ...
//     MESSAGE
//
// On 2026-09-05 the CEO rewrote that message BY EDITING THE EVIDENCE FILE, believing it was the
// text. It was not. Editing it alone changes nothing a contributor ever sees and makes the
// record false; the wording was carried back into the heredoc by hand and the block re-rendered
// from the workflow's own bytes. Nothing checked that they agreed — no test, no script, no
// workflow — and the failure is silent in BOTH directions. Edit the evidence: the record lies.
// Edit the heredoc: the record lies. This suite is the thing that now checks.
//
// AND THE SILENT DIRECTION THAT IS WORSE THAN EITHER. Vouch renders the message with Nushell's
// `format pattern`, so a stray `{` or `}` anywhere in the text is a RENDER ERROR — and an
// errored job closes nothing while looking perfectly installed on the Actions tab. That failure
// needs no disagreement between the two files at all: both could carry the same stray brace and
// the gate would quietly stop gating. So the brace invariant is asserted independently of the
// comparison, and it is the one check here that would still be worth running if the evidence
// file did not exist.
//
// ── FIVE THINGS THIS HAS TO GET RIGHT, EACH OF WHICH IS A WAY TO WRITE A CHECK THAT PASSES
//    WHILE THE REAL THING FAILS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// 1. THE BYTES THE RUNNER SEES ARE NOT THE BYTES IN THE FILE. The heredoc sits inside a YAML
//    literal block scalar (`run: |`), indented ten spaces. YAML strips that indentation before
//    the shell ever sees the script, so a naive read of `vouch-pr.yml` compares text that is
//    ten spaces wider than anything vouch will ever open. Check 1 dedents it and then PROVES
//    the dedent two independent ways: by handing the extracted script to a real `bash` with a
//    real `RUNNER_TEMP` and reading back the file the shell actually wrote, and (check 2) by
//    parsing the same workflow with a real YAML parser and demanding the same bytes. It also
//    asserts that the naive read DIFFERS, so the trap is shown to be real rather than assumed.
//
// 2. THE RENDERER IS VOUCH'S, NOT A LOOKALIKE. `format pattern` is a Nushell builtin, and a
//    re-implementation of it that diverges is exactly a check that stays green while the job
//    errors. So the real thing runs: vouch's own `vouch/template.nu` at the commit the workflow
//    PINS, fetched as a source tarball whose sha256 is the one the evidence records, driven by
//    the same `nu` a runner would install.
//
// 3. NOTHING IS TYPED THAT COULD BE READ. The four placeholder names come out of vouch's own
//    `gh-check-pr` source (the record it pipes into `template render`); the four sample values
//    come out of the evidence file's own prose; the pinned commit comes out of the workflow;
//    the tarball digest comes out of the evidence. A typed expectation is a second document to
//    keep true, and this suite exists because the first one went stale. Same rule, same reason,
//    as `docs-claims.js` next to it.
//
// 4. EMPTY IS A FAILURE, NOT A PASS. Every inventory — the placeholder set, the sample record,
//    the evidence's rendered block, the quoted opener in the walkthrough — is asserted non-empty
//    before it is compared. A regex that stops matching must not make a join trivially true.
//
// 5. A PIN THAT MOVES WITHOUT THE EVIDENCE MOVING IS THE SAME BUG ONE LEVEL OUT. The evidence
//    names the commit it was rendered at. Check 4 joins that name to the workflow's `uses:` line
//    and to `raw/vouch-pin-resolution.txt`, so bumping the action without re-rendering fails
//    here rather than being discovered by a stranger.
//
// ── WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT COVER ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// That the comment is POSTED. That needs the token, the API and a pull request from a second
// account, and it is §4 of the walkthrough — the maintainer's to run. Everything here is about
// the text; nothing here is evidence that the gate has ever fired. The workflow header and
// `docs/verification/pr-trust-gate-2026-09-05/README.md` both say "configured, not proven", and
// a green run of this suite does not change that sentence.
//
// ── DEPENDENCIES, AND WHY THEY ARE HARD RATHER THAN OPTIONAL ───────────────────────────────
//
// `nu` on PATH (`brew install nushell`; `ui-suite-ci.yml` installs it) and, on the first run,
// network access to fetch 41 KB of vouch source into the gitignored `.vouch/` cache beside this
// file. Neither is allowed to turn into a skip. A suite that quietly passes when it cannot do
// its work is the exact failure this directory has now produced twice — a scanner reporting
// CLEAN over an empty corpus, and a `run.js` reporting "all 4 suites passed" over a suite it was
// not running — so a missing interpreter or an unreachable cache is a RED CHECK naming the
// one-line fix, never a green run over nothing.
//
// No browser: like `docs-claims.js`, this is a plain node script. `run.js` runs every .js in
// this directory, so it is registered by existing.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// EVERY CHECK ABOVE WAS RUN RED, on 2026-09-05, before it was believed
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// A green suite proves nothing about a check that could not fail. Each mutation below was
// applied to the real tree, run, and reverted; the suite was green before each and green again
// after. `#` is the check that went red and had to.
//
//  1. #6, #7  one word in the HEREDOC — "sorry about the abrupt landing" -> "apologies about
//             the abrupt landing". This is the case the whole suite exists for: the workflow
//             moves, the evidence does not, and today nothing noticed.
//  2. #6      one word in the EVIDENCE block — "still in your fork" -> "still in your clone".
//             The other direction, and the one the CEO actually took: edit the record, change
//             nothing a contributor reads. Reported at line 22 of the message.
//  3. #3,#5,  a stray brace — "That's it." -> "That's it {.". Check 3 named the line; check 5
//     #6,#7   showed vouch's real engine failing with `nu::shell::delimiter_error`, which on a
//             live run is a job that closes nothing while looking installed. This mutation is
//             why the brace invariant is a check of its own: both files could carry it and
//             agree.
//  4. #4      the pin moved to a commit the evidence was not rendered at. Check 4 named the
//             disagreement; 3 and 5 failed too, because a pin nobody published cannot be
//             fetched, and that is the honest outcome rather than a fallback to a cached tree.
//  5. #1      a second command (`echo staged`) added after the heredoc closes. Nothing else
//             went red — the message is unchanged — which is the point: the step stops being a
//             pure write, and only the check that owns the shape says so.
//  6. #1,#2   the block-scalar dedent broken in THIS FILE (`body.push(line)` instead of
//             `body.push(line.slice(indent))`). Check 2 caught it against a real YAML parser.
//             Without that mutation, check 2 is a claim about a parser nobody has tested.
//  7. #3,#5   the evidence stopped recording the tarball sha256. The engine cannot be pinned to
//             the one the evidence used, so the checks refuse rather than fetch whatever is
//             served.
//  8. #4      the evidence stopped naming the commit it was rendered at — EMPTY INVENTORY,
//             failed rather than passing vacuously. Note that 5 and 6 stayed green: the render
//             still matched. That is exactly the silent state check 4 exists to refuse.
//  9. #7      the walkthrough's quoted opener drifted. It did not need a mutation to go red the
//             first time — it was already stale on the committed tree, still telling the
//             maintainer to expect "Hi @<account>, and thank you for this" from before the
//             CEO's rewrite. A stale "correct result" is worse than none: it is an instruction
//             to read a real pass as a failure. Fixed in the same commit.
