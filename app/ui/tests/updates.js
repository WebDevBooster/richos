// THE UPDATE SURFACE — RICH-TODOs row 12, driven through the real renderer.
//
// The row said, verbatim: *"There is no updater of any kind — no `tauri-plugin-updater`, no
// Sparkle, nothing. The CEO's 'automatically download and install whatever the user needs'
// currently rests on zero infrastructure."* This suite is the browser half of the answer.
//
// WHAT THIS SUITE CANNOT DO, said first so nothing here is mistaken for more than it is.
// It CANNOT prove that an update applies. That is a claim about a signed `.app.tar.gz`
// replacing a running bundle and is proven where it happens — `app/scripts/updater-e2e.sh`,
// which builds 0.1.0 and 0.1.1, serves a manifest, and makes 0.1.0 become 0.1.1 on this
// machine, then tampers with one byte of the artifact and shows the updater REFUSE. Nothing
// in a browser can do either, and a suite that asserted a count it got from `mock.js` would
// be proving the mock.
//
// WHAT IT DOES PROVE IS THE HALF THAT LIVES IN THE PAGE, and the four that matter are:
//
//   * THE SURFACE EXISTS AND IS NOT SILENT. Nine states, each with its own sentence, and
//     "never checked" distinguishable from "checked and you are current". A silent updater
//     is one that can be broken for three months without anyone learning it.
//   * A REFUSED SIGNATURE IS NOT OFFERED A RETRY. Every other failure gets "Try again";
//     this one does not, because retrying a tampered artifact refuses identically and a
//     button that invites someone to keep pressing until a security check passes is the
//     wrong control. This is the check most likely to be broken by a well-meaning edit.
//   * NO PERCENTAGE WITHOUT A DENOMINATOR. A server that sends no `Content-Length` gets an
//     indeterminate bar with NO `aria-valuenow` — a determinate bar over an invented total
//     is a lie that looks like a measurement.
//   * THE BUTTONS DO WHAT THEY SAY. Asserted on the commands actually issued
//     (`__RICHOS_MOCK__.updateCalls()`), not on the button looking pressed.
//   * IT ANNOUNCES ITSELF WITHOUT BEING OPENED, and only when there is something to say
//     (checks 12-14, added 2026-09-04 for §26's placement ruling). Everything above this
//     line was green on the day the CEO said *"the user can't be bothered to hunt for some
//     update button somewhere"* — which is the point: the row was correct and it was inside
//     a menu, so nobody met it. The half that carries the ruling is the ABSENCE half: with
//     nothing to install there is no element at all, proven by count, by the wrapper's own
//     geometry, and by driving the state back after the element has once existed.
//
// Contrast for this surface is NOT here: it is in `contrast.js`'s three `updates-*`
// surfaces, walked in both themes against the same 4.5 / 3.0 floors as everything else.
// Two checkers for one property is how one of them rots.
//
// EVERY CHECK HERE WAS RUN RED ONCE by breaking the shipped source; the mutations are listed
// at the bottom of this file.
//
// Run: node updates.js   (or `npm test` for every suite in this directory)

// =========================================================================================
// THE MUTATIONS — every check above was RUN RED, by breaking the SHIPPED source
// =========================================================================================
//
// Recorded as run on 2026-08-31, with the ACTUAL set of checks each one reddened rather
// than the set I expected. Two of them reddened more than their own check, and that is
// reported here rather than tidied away: a mutation that takes ten checks down with it says
// something true about how much of this surface rests on one line.
//
//    #  mutation (all against the shipped source, then restored)          checks reddened
//   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//    1  settings-button.js: deleted `if (updates) menu.appendChild(          1,2,3,4,5,
//       buildUpdatesRow())` — the row stops existing                         6,7,8,9,10
//    2  updates.js: made `sentences()`'s `default:` arm return the           2
//       `upToDate` sentence — an unknown state claiming the app is current
//    3  updates.js: made the `idle` arm return the `upToDate` sentence       3
//    4  updates.js: dropped `|| v.state === "unconfigured"` from the         4
//       Check button's `disabled`
//    5  updates.js: removed `&& !isSignature(v)` from the Check label —      5
//       a refused signature offered "Try again"
//    6  updates.js: made `nodes.detail.textContent` a 40-character slice     6
//    7  updates.js: made the `pct === null` arm unreachable, so an           7
//       unknown total painted a determinate bar
//    8  updates.js: made `marker()` mark every state but `ready` and         8
//       `unconfigured`
//    9  updates.js: made the Restart button call `update_check`              9
//   10  updates.js: `render()` builds only when `!nodes`, never comparing    10
//       `nodes.container` — paints into the detached pre-rebuild tree
//   11  updates.js: threw inside `sentences()`'s `installing` arm            2,8,11
//
// Check 11 (no page errors) is the one that catches #11, and #11 also reddens 2 and 8
// because both drive the `installing` state on their way through.
//
// THE CUE (checks 12-14), run 2026-09-04, same rule: every mutation below was applied to the
// SHIPPED source, the suite run, the file restored and compared byte for byte against its
// backup. The reddened set is the one that was OBSERVED, not the one expected.
//
//   12  updates.js: `cue()`'s `want` can never be empty — the pill is built for       12,13
//       every state and merely changes its label. THE defect the ruling names: a
//       permanent control that occasionally changes color is one an eye stops seeing
//   13  updates.js: `cue()`'s host lookup returns null, so the element is never       12,13,14
//       built at all — the state this surface was in before the placement ruling
//   14  updates.js: `openTheRow` calls `update_install` instead of opening the        14
//       menu — the announcement quietly becomes §26's mode 1, which the CEO ruled
//       on 2026-09-04 is a design session of its own
//   15  updates.js: the cue writes its own label, `"Update"`, instead of              12,14
//       `sentences(v).headline` — the version stops being named and the chrome and
//       the row become two vocabularies that agree until one of them is edited
//   16  updates.js: the cue is appended AFTER the settings button instead of          13
//       inserted before it, so the button the CEO already aims at moves out from
//       under his pointer the moment an update arrives
//
// MUTATION 12 IS THE ONE THAT PAID FOR ITSELF, and it is recorded here rather than tidied
// away. On its first run it reddened check 12 and left check 13 GREEN — because `readCue`
// measured the wrapper's geometry only on the branch where no cue existed, so check 13's
// footprint assertion was comparing `undefined` with `undefined` and could not fail. The
// geometry is measured on both branches now. A negative assertion that cannot fail is not a
// check, and only running the mutation says which is which.
//
// THE WORK GATE (checks 15-17), run 2026-09-05, same rule: every mutation below was applied
// to the SHIPPED source, the suite run, the file restored and compared by sha256 against its
// backup. The reddened set is the one that was OBSERVED, not the one expected.
//
//   17  updates.js: dropped `|| !!v.busy` from `nodes.install.hidden` — the control        15
//       he cannot safely press is offered again. THE defect the CEO found: "I suspect
//       that the current thread would die if I were to press that update button"
//   18  updates.js: `marker()`'s `v.busy ? "" :` short-circuited to false — the mark on     15
//       the settings button survives, saying LOOK AT ME with nothing safe to look at
//   19  updates.js: dropped `!v.busy` from `cue()`'s `want` — the actionable pill          15,16
//       survives, so the chrome offers the press and the waiting cue sits beside it
//   20  updates.js: `waitingCue` builds a `<button type="button">` instead of a            16
//       `<span role="note">`. It LOOKS identical and it is announced as a control to
//       every screen reader and offered to every voice user — "not an actionable
//       thing" is a claim about the markup, which is why the check reads the tag
//   21  updates.js: removed the `focus` listener, leaving the note hover-only — the        16
//       exact failure the requirement names, invisible to a keyboard and to a tap
//   22  updates.js: `gateClauses` stops appending `v.unchecked` — the reassurance          17
//       silently starts implying a check the gate never made
//   23  updates.js: `readyFor`'s threshold moved from `days < 1` to `days < 0`, so         17
//       every update claims an age and the line stops meaning anything
//   24  updates.js: the two reassurance sentences replaced with "RichOS will install       15
//       it when your work is finished" — 26's mode 1 promised over a product that
//       still needs a button press. It is the sentence the brief originally asked for
//       and it is the one thing here that would have shipped a lie
//
// MUTATION 19 IS WORTH THE LINE IT TAKES. It reddened 16 as well as 15, unprompted, because
// check 16 asserts `cueCount === 0` beside its own existence — the two cues are one rule with
// two branches, and a mutation that breaks the rule breaks both branches. That is the
// difference between two checks that agree and two checks that are the same check twice.
//
// AND THE POSITIVE PROBE FOR THE CONTRAST HALF, because a green walk over an element nobody
// looked at is the same as no walk: `.update-cue-label`'s ink was repainted `#b09a6a` and
// `contrast.js` was run. It failed `9.updates-available` by name, in BOTH themes — 1.13:1 on
// the dark fill and 1.44:1 on the light one — which is the evidence that the 7.68 / 4.72 the
// shipped pair computes to is a measurement of this element and not of an assumption about
// it. The backgrounds WebKit resolved (`#c2a35c` and `#9c7c34`) are the two tokens the
// stylesheet's ledger says they are.
//
// The waiting cue got the same treatment on 2026-09-05: `contrast.js` grew an
// `updates-waiting` surface (the only one that can paint an element which exists only while
// `busy`, and it opens the note by FOCUS rather than hover so the pixels walked are the ones
// a keyboard user meets), and `.update-waiting-note`'s ink was repainted `#7c8496`. It failed
// `9.updates-waiting` by name in BOTH themes — 3.65:1 light, 4.1:1 dark, on a 16px node — so
// the 12.06 / 18.07 the shipped pair computes to is a measurement of that element. The
// grounds WebKit resolved (`rgb(253, 252, 248)` and `rgb(24, 36, 64)`) are `--surface` in
// each theme, which is what `style.css`'s ledger says they are.
