// THE LIVE HALF OF §7, and §6.4's opening line — against the REAL renderer under WebKit.
//
// `workers.js` proves what a worker row LOOKS like once it is in the model. It says nothing
// about how it got there, and until 2026-08-29 the answer was: only through a `get_timeline`
// snapshot. `rich://worker-upserted` was deferred in the emitter (live.rs:26) and had no
// listener in `main.js`, so during a turn — exactly when the CEO wants to know Rich has
// delegated — a delegation showed as a nameless "Worked" row. The §26 fixture measured it:
// 0 chips live, 3 after the snapshot.
//
// So this suite never calls `applySnapshot` to get a worker on screen. Every chip below
// arrives through `RichTimeline.onWorkerUpserted`, the function `main.js`'s listener calls,
// with the payload `LiveEvent::WorkerUpserted::payload` puts on the wire.
//
// Four things it proves, in order of importance:
//
//   1. A live turn shows the delegation AS IT HAPPENS, with no snapshot read.
//   2. THE LIVE ROW AND THE RELOADED ROW AGREE — same worker, same wording, same state,
//      same DOM. A row that changes when the turn ends would be a new defect.
//   3. THE CROSS-ENTITY NEGATIVE CONTROL on the live payload, with a positive probe and a
//      vacuity check, so it fails when the guard is removed.
//   4. §6.4's two defaults: a running turn is expanded, a completed one collapses, and the
//      CEO beats both.
