// THE TWO PROMISED NUMBERS — RICH-TODOs "virtualization" row.
//
// §25 "Accessibility and performance" makes two claims with a number in them:
//
//     "A 10,000-item thread history remains smooth through virtualization."
//     "A 10,000-entity seeded index remains searchable and bounded."
//
// Until 2026-08-30 neither had a test, and the first had no implementation either — three
// documents said the timeline "uses virtualized infinite scroll" and
// `grep -rn virtualiz app/` returned nothing. A capability a document claims and the tree
// does not deliver is the defect this project exists to catch, and it was sitting in the
// design record for the surface the CEO looks at most.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT THIS SUITE PINS, AND WHY IT IS NOT ONLY TIMINGS
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// A budget in milliseconds is a real check and it is also a flaky one: it moves with the
// machine, the load and the WebKit build. So every timing here is paired with a STRUCTURAL
// check of the property that produces it — reuse is asserted by NODE IDENTITY, correctness
// of that reuse by a byte-for-byte comparison against a from-scratch render, and the
// projection's fast path against the brute-force scan it replaced. If the budgets are ever
// loosened, those keep working.
//
// The budgets are set roughly an order of magnitude above the measured figure and roughly
// an order of magnitude below the number this work started from, so they catch a return of
// the defect and not a busy laptop. Measured and baseline figures are named at each one.
// Full sweeps: `docs/verification/timeline-scale-2026-08-30/`, tool `lib/scale-bench.js`.
//
// THE SECOND NUMBER IS NOT IN THIS FILE, AND THAT IS SAID OUT LOUD RATHER THAN LEFT TO A
// READER. The 10,000-entity index is `run_search` in `app/src-tauri/src/main.rs`, a
// different component in a different language; its test is the Rust one named in check 10,
// and check 10 exists so that half of the row cannot quietly lose its test while this half
// keeps passing.
//
// NO PAGINATION (standing rule, CEO). Check 9 is structural: at 10,000 items every turn is
// mounted and the DOM carries no page control of any kind. This work made the timeline
// faster by reusing nodes, NEVER by rendering fewer turns.
//
// Every check here was run RED once, by breaking the thing it guards in the shipped source.
// Those runs are transcribed in
// `docs/verification/timeline-scale-2026-08-30/mutation-runs.txt`.

// signatures, DOM construction — is what turn reuse removed, and it is the one that
// regresses if reuse ever breaks. The rest is WebKit re-measuring a 1,000-child flex column

//
// turns it back into a gate, and it is measured and PRINTED on every run either way. What it
// answers is "is this machine quick enough to hold 60fps over a 10,000-item thread", which is
// a question about the machine — 17ms here (vsync), 23ms p50 / 68ms p95 on a GitHub
// `macos-latest` runner (run 33933067025), which has three vCPUs and no GPU. Run it on the
// hardware the CEO actually uses, or on a machine with GPU compositing, and it means what it
// says; run it on a shared virtualized runner and it measures the runner.
//
// WHAT REPLACED IT AS THE GATE is two things that do not move with the machine: the drag over
// the whole history writes NOTHING to the DOM (check 6), and the SAME motion costs no more per
// frame at 10,000 items than at a short thread (check 7). Zero is zero on any machine, and a

// proportional to history length — which is the defect, and is what 257ms of structural work
// on the frame looked like — would read 8.3x here, because that is the ratio of the two arms'
// histories (1,000 turns against CONTROL_TURNS). Measured on this machine, median frame at
// 1,000 turns against the control: 1.00x at 1280x900 quiet, 1.00x under a load average of 34
// on ten cores, and 2.35x at 2560x1600 under that same load — a viewport 4.5x the area, which
// is the harshest per-frame rasterization cost this machine can be made to produce and is
// harsher than the runner's own (the runner's median frame was 23ms; that arm's was 40ms).
// 5 is a shade over twice the worst figure measured and still 1.7x under the defect it guards.

// rasterized. At the fixture's measured 518.19px per turn (518,189px / 1,000 turns), 54,000px
// is 104.2 turns; 120 measures 62,223px, which clears the travel plus a whole viewport with
// room over. THE 40 THAT WAS HERE COULD NOT: 40 turns is 20,773px, 23 viewports, so at the big
// arm's own 8,636px step it wrapped twenty times in 60 frames and spent two frames in three on
// tiles it had already rasterized. That is what it was really measuring when it read 20ms

    // vCPUs, no GPU, software rasterization — which is a fact about the runner. It had a ratio
    // arm as a second chance and the ratio went red too, at 3.40x, and THAT is the part worth
    // writing down, because the ratio was not measuring what it said either:
    //
    //   THE OLD CONTROL WAS 40 TURNS AT THE BIG ARM'S OWN STEP. The big arm covers 518,173px
    //   in 60 steps, so its step is 8,636px — 9.6 viewports. A 40-turn history is 20,773px,
    //   two and a bit steps, so the control WRAPPED twenty times and spent most of its frames
    //   re-rasterizing three screenfuls it had already drawn. Warm tiles against cold tiles is
    //   not "the same motion over a shorter thread"; on a machine fast enough for both arms to
    //   sit on vsync the difference is invisible (both read 17ms here), and on a runner where
    //   rasterization is the bottleneck it IS the ratio.

    // frame, 60 frames, no wrap, in both. Same pixels rasterized per frame, same content
    // complexity, same browser, same viewport; the only difference left is how much timeline
    // is mounted behind it — 1,000 turns against ${CONTROL_TURNS}. Interleaved pass by pass so
    // a machine that gets busy halfway gets busy for both arms, and compared on the MEDIAN

//     `container.parentNode.addEventListener("scroll", () => render(model, container, opts))`.
//     This is the regression the row is about and it is INVISIBLE to every instrument this
//     check had before today: DOM mutations 0 (turn reuse rewrites nothing), median frame
//     17ms (4ms of JS fits inside a 16.7ms frame), ratio 1.00x. The model-read counter went
//     from 0 to 180,180 and check 6 went red. That run is why the counter exists.
//
//  2. FULL REBUILD ON SCROLL — the same listener plus `renderCache.delete(container)`, so
//     every frame rebuilds all 1,000 turns. Check 6 red on the DOM counter (60,060
//     mutations). Check 7 red on the ratio, measured with check 6's guard lifted so the
//     number could be read: median frame 363ms against the control's 40ms = 9.07x, against
//     a 5x budget and an 8.3x proportional-cost expectation. Checks 2 and 3 went red too,
//     which is correct — they own reuse.
//
//  3. THE CONTROL PUT BACK TO 40 TURNS — check 7 red on `an arm wrapped and re-read warm
//     tiles — big 0, control 2`. That guard is the whole reason this pair is not the old
//     check with a bigger number in it.
//
// WHAT IS NOT COVERED, SAID PLAINLY. Check 7's ratio is the weaker half and it is the only
// thing left holding the browser's OWN per-frame cost — a CSS or DOM-shape change that makes
// WebKit's work proportional to document height rather than to the viewport (a lost
// containment, a filter, a sticky child, a shadow over the whole column). Nothing in JS
// reads or writes on that path, so check 6 cannot see it, and a 5x budget will only catch it
// once it is gross. The absolute 60fps claim is no longer gated anywhere in CI; it is
// measured and printed on every run, and `RICHOS_FRAME_BUDGET_MS=30 node scale.js` on
// hardware with GPU compositing is what turns it back into a gate.
