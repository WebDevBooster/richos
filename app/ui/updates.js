// THE UPDATE SURFACE — what the CEO sees when RichOS updates itself.
//
// RICH-TODOs row 12: before this there was no updater of any kind, so "automatically
// download and install whatever the user needs" rested on zero infrastructure. The Rust
// half is `app/src-tauri/src/updates.rs`; this is the half a person looks at.
//
// A SILENT UPDATER IS NOT ACCEPTABLE, and that is a constraint rather than a preference. An
// updater nobody can see is one that can be broken for three months without anyone learning
// it. So:
//
//   * RichOS checks by itself, three seconds after launch. This row always says WHEN it last
//     looked and WHAT it found — "never checked" is a state, and it is a different state
//     from "checked, and you are current".
//   * Every failure names WHICH failure it is in a sentence a non-technical CEO can act on,
//     with the vendor's own error text one click behind it. An error that hides its cause
//     turns a five-minute diagnosis into a week.
//   * A REFUSED SIGNATURE IS NOT OFFERED A RETRY. Every other failure gets "Try again",
//     because every other failure is plausibly transient. A signature failure means the
//     bytes on the wire are not the bytes we signed; retrying produces the same refusal, and
//     a button that invites someone to keep pressing until a security check passes is the
//     wrong shape of button. It gets an explanation instead.
//
// WHERE IT ANNOUNCES ITSELF (CEO ruling §26, placement paragraph, 2026-09-04). The row below
// was, until that ruling, the whole surface — and it lives inside a menu, so a waiting update
// reached only a CEO who happened to open one. His words: *"the user can't be bothered to
// hunt for some update button somewhere."* So there is now a CUE — see the block above
// `cue()` for the whole reasoning — a single small element that APPEARS beside the universal
// settings button when, and only when, something is waiting, and is absent from the document
// entirely the rest of the time. It announces and leads; the row still decides.
//
// WHERE THE ROW LIVES, AND WHY NOT IN THE RAIL'S PREFERENCES POPOVER. It renders into a row of
// the UNIVERSAL settings menu — the button §15 says is "ALWAYS EVERYWHERE ON EVERY PAGE" —
// through `RichSettings.registerUpdates`, the same optional-capability seam Techy Mode and
// the opening-screen switch use. The rail popover was tried first and MEASURED: it went from
// 581px to 761px, and at 761px it covers eight more rail rows, which turned `techy.js`
// check 9 red because a click meant for a thread landed on the popover. That popover is
// full. The universal menu is 160px in a 900px window, and it is on every screen — which is
// also the better home for a thing whose entire point is that the CEO can see it.
//
// TALKS ONLY TO `window.RichBridge`, never to `window.__TAURI__` — the same rule main.js
// follows, and the reason `mock.js` can drive all nine states in a plain browser.
//
// WHILE RICHOS IS WORKING, THE ACTION IS ABSENT AND THE FACT IS NOT (CEO, 2026-09-05).
//
// He found this himself, watching another app: *"while a live thread is currently running in
// the Codex app, I saw that blue update button appear. And I suspect that the current thread
// would die if I were to press that update button. I'm certainly not gonna try to find out."*
// The button he was afraid of was ours too — `updates.rs`'s `update_relaunch` was
// `app.restart()` and nothing else.
//
// His fix, and it is better than disabling: *"we don't even show the update button/
// notification if the RichOS app currently has active things running."* So while
// `view.busy`, the Install control, the Restart control, the settings-button mark and the
// actionable cue are all REMOVED — not dimmed, not dulled. **This product already made this
// decision once**: when `voice_readiness` says a machine cannot turn speech into words,
// `main.js` removes the talk button rather than disabling it, because the affordance appears
// only where it functions.
//
// **AND HIDING THE ACTION IS NOT HIDING THE FACT.** 26 rules that *"an update nobody
// discovers is the same as no updater at all, and it is worse than none because the
// machinery reports itself healthy"*, and RichOS is built to run workers for long stretches
// — so an update could otherwise stay invisible for days. His answer: *"instead of a regular
// update button, they'd get some other visual cue but not an actionable thing."* That is
// `waitingCue()` below: a small non-interactive indicator that appears in the same chrome,
// carries its own explanation, and cannot be pressed.
//
//   * IT IS FOCUSABLE AND ITS EXPLANATION IS REACHABLE WITHOUT A POINTER. A hover tooltip
//     gives a keyboard user nothing and a tap nothing. The note opens on FOCUS as well as
//     hover, and the whole sentence is the element's accessible name, so it is announced
//     even where the note is never painted. A fix for invisibility that is invisible to part
//     of the audience is not a fix.
//   * IT SAYS THE REASSURING THING, NOT THE PROCEDURAL ONE. "We are not showing the update
//     button" explains OUR behavior; what he wants to know is that an update is ready, that
//     it is waiting for his work, and that nothing will be interrupted. One calm sentence in
//     Rich's voice, which is the direct answer to "I'm certainly not gonna try to find out".
//   * IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THE BUTTON. The actionable cue is a wide filled gold pill
//     carrying a version; this is a small outlined circle with no label. If the two resembled
//     each other he would eventually press one expecting the other, which is the anxiety
//     being removed.
//
// THE ROW'S SENTENCES STAY TRUE UNDER BOTH UPDATE MODES. Nothing here promises that RichOS
// will install by itself when the work ends — that is 26's mode 1, which that ruling puts in
// a design session of its own and which `updates.rs` does not build. "I'll wait until
// everything has finished" is true of the product that exists (the control returns and he
// presses it) and stays true of the one that is coming (it installs itself), so no sentence
// here becomes a lie in either direction.
//
// CONTRAST: every pair this file switches between is listed with its computed ratio, both
// themes, in `style.css`'s `.update-*` block. Nothing here is exempt from the floor and
// nothing here claims to be.

  // THE ANNOUNCEMENT, IN CHROME THE CEO IS ALREADY LOOKING AT.
  //
  // CEO ruling §26, the placement paragraph added 2026-09-04, in his words: *"the user can't
  // be bothered to hunt for some update button somewhere."* Everything above this line
  // renders into a row of the universal settings menu, which means a waiting update was
  // discoverable only by someone who opened that menu — and nothing gave them a reason to.
  // An update nobody discovers is the same as no updater at all, and worse than none,
  // because the machinery reports itself healthy.
  //
  // THE PROPERTY THAT MATTERS IS THAT IT IS TRANSIENT, NOT THAT IT IS VISIBLE. With nothing
  // to install there is NO CONTROL AT ALL here — not a dimmed one, not an "up to date" state,
  // not a placeholder. The element is removed from the document. The signal is the
  // APPEARANCE of something that was not there a moment ago; a permanent control that
  // occasionally changes color is one an eye learns to stop seeing. (The reference the CEO
  // supplied is Codex, captured 2026-09-04 and kept privately in richos-hq: with no update
  // pending that slot in its bottom bar holds an ordinary help control, and the blue download
  // circle exists only while an update is waiting.)
  //
  // WHERE IT SITS, AND WHY THERE. Inside `.settings` — the wrapper of the universal settings
  // button, which §15 puts "ALWAYS EVERYWHERE ON EVERY PAGE" and which `settings-button.js`
  // mounts against `document.body` at a fixed position above every overlay. That single
  // choice buys every surface at once: the shell, an open thread, the home screen, the
  // opening screen, and anything added later. The rail's footer was the closer analogue to
  // the reference's bottom bar and was rejected on two measurements rather than on taste:
  // the rail is `display: none` under `body.rail-closed`, which is reachable at any width
  // below 1180px, so the affordance would be behind a toggle — the one thing the ruling
  // forbids — and the rail's default width is 300px, which cannot hold a label that names a
  // version without truncating it.
  //
  // THIS FILE DOES NOT FORK THE FLOW. The cue carries no state of its own, issues no command,
  // and writes no sentence: its label is `sentences(v).headline`, the SAME string the row
  // renders, so the two can never disagree. Pressing it opens the menu the row lives in and
  // puts the hand on the row's own control. Everything that decides anything — the install,
  // the restart, the refused signature that is never offered a retry — stays in the row.
  //
  // WHICH STATES, AND WHY NOT THE OTHERS. Exactly `available` and `ready`: the two states
  // where something is waiting on the CEO, which is the same pair `marker()` has always used
  // and is therefore one rule rather than two that agree most of the time.
  //   * `downloading` / `installing` — the operation is under way and nothing is waiting on
  //     him. It can only have been started from the row, which is open in front of him and
  //     which owns the progress bar. A second progress readout in the chrome would be the
  //     fork this file exists not to make.
  //   * `failed` — deliberately NOT announced here, and this is the one gap worth naming
  //     rather than hiding. The failure headlines `updates.rs` writes are whole sentences
  //     ("This download was not signed by RichOS, so it was not installed."); a pill wide
  //     enough to carry one is a banner, and §26 asks for the opposite of a banner. A failure
  //     is still stated in full in the row, exactly as it was before this cue existed, so
  //     nothing regressed — but a failure that happens with the menu shut is still quiet, and
  //     what failure should look like in chrome is one of the things the CEO's reference does
  //     not answer.
  //
  // MODE 1 (install with no click at all) IS NOT PRESUPPOSED ANYWHERE HERE. §26 makes it the
  // default and the CEO ruled on 2026-09-04 that hands-free updating waits for a design
  // session of its own. The cue announces and leads; it never starts anything.

  //
  // THE FACT, WITH NOTHING TO PRESS.
  //
  // CEO, 2026-09-05, on what should stand where the update button is not being shown:
  // *"we could show something like an info icon or something that shows a tooltip/popup on
  // hover and explains that while there's an update available we're not currently showing
  // the update button because there's currently work running ... instead of a regular update
  // button, they'd get some other visual cue but not an actionable thing like the update
  // button."*
  //
  // WHY IT IS NOT A BUTTON, IN THE MARKUP AND NOT ONLY IN THE STYLING. It is a `span` with
  // `role="note"`, and it has no click handler at all. A `button` that did nothing would be
  // announced as a button to every screen reader and offered to every voice user, and the
  // one property this element must have is that pressing it is not a thing that exists.
  //
  // BUT IT IS FOCUSABLE (`tabindex="0"`), and that is the requirement a tooltip alone fails.
  // Hover reaches a pointer and nobody else. The note opens on FOCUS as well as on hover, so
  // a keyboard user meets it by tabbing; and the whole sentence is the element's
  // `aria-label`, so it is announced on focus even where the note is never painted at all. A
  // fix for invisibility that is itself invisible to part of the audience is not a fix.
  //
  // THE NOTE IS `aria-hidden`, DELIBERATELY. Its text is the same string as the accessible
  // name — one value, generated once — so leaving it in the accessibility tree would make a
  // screen reader read the sentence twice. Sighted and pointer users get the painted note;
  // everyone else gets the identical words from the name. They cannot disagree because
  // there is only one of them.
  //
  // WHICH STATES: `available` and `ready`, and only while `busy` — the exact complement of
  // `cue()` above, so at any moment the chrome holds the actionable pill, or this, or
  // nothing. Never both. `downloading` and `installing` are deliberately not here: the
  // bytes are already moving, nothing is waiting on him, and the row owns the progress bar.

  /// The sentence, generated ONCE and used for both the accessible name and the painted note.
