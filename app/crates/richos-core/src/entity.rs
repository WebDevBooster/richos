//! ENTITY — the hard scope and privacy boundary (ECS architecture §3.2–3.4).
//!
//! An entity is a company, division, fund, book or venture. The UX brief §1 is explicit
//! that it is *"also a hard scope and privacy boundary"* rather than a folder, and §22's
//! "Must not be faked" list names **cross-entity context** directly. So this module's job
//! is not to carry a label around; it is to make the ECS scope key
//!
//! ```text
//! person_id + entity_id + thread_id + binding_revision + turn_id + audience
//! ```
//!
//! real rather than advisory. Slice 1 implements every component of that key except
//! `audience`: there is exactly one audience today (the CEO), the worker slice that
//! introduces a second one is a later leg, and a field that never differentiates anything
//! would be decoration, not enforcement. It is named here so nobody has to rediscover the
//! omission.
//!
//! Three rules from ECS §3.2–3.4 are load-bearing here and are enforced, not documented:
//!
//! 1. **Every thread has exactly one home entity, immutable after creation.** Moving a
//!    conversation to another entity creates a NEW thread; it never rebinds. That is why
//!    [`ThreadBinding`] has private fields, no setter and no `&mut` accessor, and why its
//!    constructor is crate-private — the only way to *obtain* one outside this crate is
//!    [`crate::ledger::Ledger::thread_binding`], which fills the entity in from the
//!    durable record. A caller cannot fabricate a binding that says something the ledger
//!    does not.
//! 2. **`entity_id` and `thread_id` are required before retrieval or mutation.** There is
//!    no unscoped read path and no unscoped write path (see `ledger.rs`).
//! 3. **An unknown or ambiguous repository root fails.** [`EntityRegistry::resolve_root`]
//!    never defaults to the last entity, the first entity or all entities.
//! 4. **The registry belongs to the person running the app, and to nobody else.** It is
//!    read from [`ENTITY_REGISTRY_FILENAME`] in this install's own configuration directory
//!    and it is EMPTY until that person puts something in it — see [`EntityRegistry::load`].
//!    Rule 4 is younger than the other three and it exists because the other three were
//!    enforced against a `const` table of one man's six companies, bound to absolute roots
//!    under his own home directory. On every machine that was not his, that table was
//!    simultaneously a privacy leak (his company list and his home path rendered in the
//!    company picker of every install) and a wall: no path a second person worked in was
//!    ever registered, so root resolution refused correctly and forever, and the only way
//!    through the picker was to file his work under one of another man's companies.
//!
//! **An empty registry is a legal state, not an error.** It resolves nothing, it refuses
//! every root, and it is what a first launch has. The app's job in that state is to ask —
//! `entity_choice`/`register_entity` in the shell — never to invent an answer.
