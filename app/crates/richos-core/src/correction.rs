//! THE CORRECTION DESK — "read what the system believes and correct it", made reachable.
//!
//! `loro-structure.md` calls this the property that must not be lost:
//!
//! > The wiki's essential property is not its content. It is that **a human can read what
//! > the system believes and correct it when it is wrong.**
//!
//! Loro's writer has been complete and demonstrable since 2026-08-29 and reachable only
//! through a CLI — `loro-writer.md` says so in its own words: *"Rich does not call the
//! writer yet… the writer's reachable surface is the CLI."* A capability the CEO can only
//! reach by opening a terminal is not a property of the product he uses. This module is the
//! loop: **propose → show him exactly what would change → he says yes → write.**
//!
//! # Ask, never infer — enforced by the type, not by a paragraph
//!
//! `ceo-decisions.md` §7 governs the write path absolutely: *"Inference cannot tell 'ship
//! Thursday' → 'ship Friday' (a change of mind) from 'deep gram' → 'Deepgram' (a real
//! correction). Asking removes the class of error entirely… **Nothing is ever learned
//! silently.**"* ECS §5.1 draws the same line: a correction is a human statement, an
//! inference is at most a candidate.
//!
//! So there is no function here that writes loro. There is [`CorrectionDesk::propose`],
//! which runs the writer with `--dry-run` and stores what WOULD be written; and there is
//! [`CorrectionDesk::confirm`], which is the only path to a write and refuses anything that
//! is not a proposal the CEO has in front of him. A caller cannot skip the ask, because
//! there is no argument it could pass to do so.
//!
//! §7's three outcomes are the state machine, verbatim: confirm (written), decline (not
//! written, **and still offered again** — a decline is ambiguous: not a record / not now /
//! misclicked), decline permanently (suppressed, and the suppression is inspectable, or a
//! record silently refuses to be correctable with no way to see why).
//!
//! # Durability
//!
//! Same posture as `steering::IntakeLog`, for the same reason: a proposal the CEO has not
//! answered yet must survive a crash, a rotation and a relaunch, or "he confirms after
//! lunch" silently loses the correction. Append-only JSONL, `sync_all` on every record, a
//! record this build cannot read skipped rather than fatal — and, since 2026-09-05,
//! **counted, classified and reported** rather than dropped in silence.
//!
//! ## What the desk's replay is, and why a dropped record is not like a dropped message
//!
//! This file is not a list of proposals. It is an EVENT LOG, and the projection is built by
//! folding each record onto the ones before it: a `Proposed` record carries the whole
//! proposal in state `AwaitingCeo`, and the CEO's ANSWER is a separate, later record
//! (`Written`, `Failed`, `Declined`, `Suppressed`). So the two ends of the file fail in
//! opposite directions, and only one of them is dangerous:
//!
//! - **Drop the earlier `Proposed` record** and the answer records that follow it find no
//!   proposal to fold onto and are silent no-ops. The proposal disappears. That is a loss,
//!   and nothing WRONG is put in front of the CEO.
//! - **Drop the later answer record** and the proposal replays in its original state —
//!   `AwaitingCeo` — which is to say **a decision he confirmed silently reverts to pending**.
//!   `pending_for` then offers it again, and `confirm` accepts it again because its state
//!   passes the check, so the write can run a second time. Being asked twice is how a person
//!   learns the machine does not remember him.
//!
//! # What this deliberately does NOT do
//!
//! - **It never widens a scope.** `loro-writer.md`: widening `ceo-private` →
//!   `org-shared`/`external` is refused without `--widen-scope`, *"because that is the one
//!   edit that turns the CEO's private view into something every worker sees, and it must
//!   be a decision rather than the side effect of fixing a typo."* The flag is not reachable
//!   from this module. Narrowing needs no ceremony and is available.
//! - **It never edits prose.** A `wiki:` ref is refused by the writer itself (exit 5) with
//!   the file path to open, and that refusal is surfaced rather than worked around: *"a
//!   machine rewriting the CEO's synthesis is not a correction, it is a substitution."*
//! - **It does not detect corrections.** Nothing here watches for "that's wrong" and files
//!   a proposal on its own. Something has to propose — Rich, in conversation, or the CEO
//!   directly — and that trigger is named as unbuilt rather than faked.
