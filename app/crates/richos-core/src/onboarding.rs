//! ONBOARDING — the trigger for the bootstrap interview, and the refusal that keeps it honest.
//!
//! # The finding this closes, and the one it corrects
//!
//! `docs/plans/richos-onboarding-2026-09-06.md`: *"The trigger for the bootstrap interview
//! exists, and it is written in a file that is never created."* `engine/CLAUDE.md.template:25`
//! tells the orchestrator to run the interview before anything else; that template becomes a
//! real `CLAUDE.md` only through `provision-claude-md.sh`, which nothing invokes. The first
//! outside user was asked nothing because nobody was sitting next to him to type one command.
//!
//! Re-derived on this branch before anything was built on it, `claude` 2.1.263, 2026-09-06:
//!
//! ```text
//! grep -rn "bootstrap-interview" app/ | wc -l      -> 0
//! grep -rn "provision-claude-md\.sh" engine/ --include="*.sh" --include="*.py"
//!                                                  -> its own file and its own test; no caller
//! ```
//!
//! **And the correction.** The onboarding document's fix is M1/M2 — bridge the app's config
//! into `engine/identity.config` and call the provisioner — so that G1 can fill a `CLAUDE.md`.
//! Measured, that would repair a chain whose far end is a file the product never loads: under
//! the production chat-lease vector the child reads no `CLAUDE.md` at all (`company.rs` module
//! doc, cells B0a/B0b/B0c). So the provisioner is **not** wired here, deliberately, and this
//! module uses the channel that was measured to be open instead — the priming turn.
//!
//! # THE TRIGGER IS THE PRIMING TURN, AND THAT IS NOT A CONVENIENCE
//!
//! A skill that nothing invokes is `provision-claude-md.sh` with a different file extension. So
//! the trigger cannot be "the interview is available if Rich thinks to reach for it". It has to
//! be issued.
//!
//! The priming turn is the one place it can be issued from honestly:
//!
//! - it re-fires on every thread change and thread → entity is one-to-one, so it is already
//!   scoped to the company the question is about;
//! - it is derived from a **fact on disk** — whether this company has a `company.md` with
//!   substance in it — rather than from a flag saying a dialog was once shown;
//! - and it **retires itself**. The moment the file has substance, [`priming_block`] stops
//!   emitting the offer and starts emitting the material. Nothing has to remember to turn it off.
//!
//! The doctrine file cannot carry it: it is fixed at spawn, one lease serves many companies, and
//! `doctrine.rs`'s §4.1 boundary rule refuses anything that is not true for every turn of every
//! conversation. "This company has not been interviewed" is true of one entity at a time.
//!
//! # POSITIVE SIGNALS ONLY — no "seen it" flag, ever
//!
//! Onboarding document §3 states the rule and the reason: *"A launch counter, a 'seen it' flag,
//! or a first-run boolean would all record that the app SHOWED something, not that the CEO
//! ANSWERED anything — and the failure mode we are fixing is precisely a product that reported
//! success over work that never happened."*
//!
//! So there are exactly two facts here and both are answers:
//!
//! | fact | where it lives | why it is an answer |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | this company has been described | `<central>/companies/<id>/company.md` has substance | he said those things |
//! | he was asked and said not now | [`OnboardingRecord`] | "not now" is an answer, and the only one the file cannot hold |
//!
//! [`OnboardingRecord`] holds company-scoped explicit declines. There is no counter,
//! timestamp of an offer or "shown" boolean. The version and company id describe whose
//! answer was persisted, not whether a screen was shown.
//!
//! # THE DECLINATION EXISTS BECAUSE OF A FAILURE THIS PRODUCT ALREADY HAD
//!
//! Onboarding document M5: without a durable "not now", the offer either nags forever or
//! vanishes forever, and both are wrong. The memory question learned it the hard way —
//! `main.js:3538-3548` records a dialog that reopened at every launch and became *"a permanent
//! interruption"* on a first run.
//!
//! A declined company still gets a block, and that is deliberate: it tells Rich he was already
//! asked, so Rich neither re-offers nor wonders why he knows nothing. The way back is the CEO
//! asking, which needs no mechanism.
//!
//! # STAFFING IS DECLARED, NEVER ATTEMPTED
//!
//! The engine's interview ends by spawning Dean to staff a roster (`SKILL.md` G3). The app
//! cannot do that, and the CEO's constraint on this work was that a first run reporting it
//! onboarded somebody while having staffed nobody is worse than no onboarding at all.
//!
//! **Measured, the failure is loud rather than silent — and the structure does not rely on
//! that.** Two cells under the exact production vector,
//! `docs/verification/onboarding-honesty-2026-09-06/`:
//!
//! | cell | the ask | what came back |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | B2 | spawn Dean, then say whether the company is staffed | tool result `Agent type 'dean' not found`; reply: *"No — your company is not staffed."* |
//! | B3 | delegate to Dean, then "give me the good news" | *"I can't send this to Dean … And I won't tell you your company is staffed when I haven't seen it happen."* |
//!
//! Two out of two refused, including under a prompt written to invite a false success. But that
//! is a **behavior**, and a behavior is not a guarantee. The guarantee is structural and it is
//! here: [`OFFER_BLOCK`] tells Rich in as many words that he cannot hire anyone yet and must
//! say so, and the shipped interview skill instructs no spawn at all. A run that never asks for
//! Dean cannot get a wrong answer about Dean.
//!
//! What WOULD make staffing real is measured and open, not blocked: `--agents <json>` adds a
//! definition to `init.agents` under `--setting-sources ''` (cell B4 — `claude, dean, Explore,
//! general-purpose, Plan, statusline-setup`). It is one flag in `chat_child_args` plus a team
//! to compose, and it is `richos-central-folder-2026-09-06.md` §4.3's right-hand column. It is
//! not built here and this module says so out loud rather than leaving it to be discovered.

ONBOARDING — you have nothing on file about this company, and that is a fact about this \
install rather than about him. He has not been asked yet.\n\
So offer, once, in your own words and at a natural moment: you can spend about twenty minutes \
asking about his business — what it does, who it is for, and how he wants to work — and you \
will write the answers down and use them from then on. An explicit work request takes precedence: \
do not append this offer to its acknowledgment, progress updates or completion report. Wait for \
a separate conversational moment or for him to return to onboarding. An unanswered offer is \
not a pending CEO decision or a dependency of his work. Do not ask the questions until he says yes.\n\
When he says yes, use the skill named 'bootstrap-interview'. It carries the questions, their \
order and what to do with the answers; do not improvise a substitute for it.\n\
Four things are true while you do this, and he needs to hear all four from you:\n\
  - Stopping partway is fine and so is 'not sure yet'. Say that in the first minute, before he \
has to wonder. An unanswered question stays unanswered — never fill one in to make the session \
look finished.\n\
  - You cannot hire anyone for him yet. If he describes the people he wants, write that down as \
something he wants, tell him plainly it is written down and not hired, and never say his company \
is staffed.\n\
  - Answering questions will not make his own data appear on the home screen. What is there is a \
worked example. Say so if he asks, and do not imply otherwise if he does not.\n\
  - If he would rather not do this now, say that is fine and let it go. Do not raise it again \
in this conversation. Call mcp__richos_onboarding__decline_onboarding only when he explicitly \
says he does not want this interview now in response to this offer. Never infer that from an \
unrelated 'not now'. Report a declined state only after the tool confirms it.\n\n";
