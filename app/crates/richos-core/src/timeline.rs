//! The TYPED TIMELINE — §12 of the Codex-inspired conversation UX brief
//! (`docs/design/richos-codex-inspired-conversation-ux-2026-08-28.md`), slice 2 of §24.
//!
//! §12 opens with the instruction this module exists to obey: *"Do not model the
//! conversation as alternating `user` and `assistant` strings. Use typed items."*
//!
//! ## What this module is, and is not
//! It is a **projection**, not a new event source. Every item it emits is derived from
//! something already durable — a ledger turn, a persisted text run, a journaled machinery
//! record. It invents no state, opens no counter, and writes nothing. That is deliberate:
//! §23's Phase 1 exit gate is *"kill and restart during each turn state without losing or
//! inventing visible state"*, and a projection over durable inputs passes that gate by
//! construction rather than by care. Re-project the same inputs and you get byte-identical
//! items, ids included (see [`TimelineItem::id`] — every id is DERIVED from its source's
//! identity, never freshly generated).
//!
//! ## The three properties that are enforced here rather than documented
//!
//! **1. One shared per-turn sequence (techy-mode §1.4 G1).** A timeline item's
//! [`sequence`](TimelineBase::sequence) is never computed by this module. It is the value
//! the client's drain point already assigned (`native.rs`'s `prompt`), read back off the machinery
//! record or the persisted text run. There is no timeline counter. A stream item with no
//! recorded position reports `sequence: None` — *unknown*, not zero.
//!
//! **2. Entity scope on every record.** Slice 1 proved the leak class is live: the
//! re-prime digest was assembling every entity's actions into every session. A record type
//! that carries `thread_id` but not `entity_id` re-opens that by omission, so
//! [`TimelineBase`] carries the full ECS fence — `entity_id`, `thread_id`, `turn_id`,
//! `binding_revision` — on every single item, and [`Timeline::project`] refuses to emit an
//! item it cannot place inside the requested binding. `MachineryRecord` carries a
//! `thread_id` and NO entity, which is exactly the omission the guard below exists for.
//!
//! **3. Visibility is a gate, not a hint.** §5's grammar depends on raw tool syntax
//! staying hidden by default, and Phase 5's exit gate is that the CEO can review an
//! outcome without seeing implementation machinery. So [`Visibility`] is not a field a
//! renderer must remember to check:
//!
//!   - [`Timeline`] does **not** implement `Serialize`. You cannot hand the whole thing to
//!     a webview. (The compile_fail doctest on [`Timeline`] pins that.)
//!   - The only way to obtain items for rendering is [`Timeline::view`], which takes a
//!     [`ViewMode`] and returns a [`TimelineView`] that has already **dropped** every item
//!     the mode may not see and **removed** — not flagged, removed — the technical detail
//!     (exact commands, output previews, file paths) from the items it keeps.
//!   - The unfiltered list is reachable only through
//!     [`Timeline::audit_including_internal`], which is named so that nobody arrives there
//!     by accident.
//!
//! ## What is REAL today and what is modelled but unsourced
//! §22's rule is *"if the source signal does not exist, build the signal first or show
//! unknown"*, so the union below is complete per §12 while the constructors are not:
//!
//! | Variant | Source today |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`TimelineItem::UserMessage`] | REAL — the ledger turn's `user_text` |
//! | [`TimelineItem::RichMessage`] | REAL text, **phase `Unknown`** for every CEO turn (see below) |
//! | [`TimelineItem::WorkDuration`] | REAL — measured from the turn's start/end events |
//! | [`TimelineItem::Activity`] | REAL — journaled machinery records |
//! | [`TimelineItem::SystemError`] | REAL — an interrupted turn |
//! | [`TimelineItem::Recovery`] | REAL — `TurnSuperseded` (mid-turn-crash replay) |
//! | [`TimelineItem::WorkerActivity`] | REAL — a `Task` call joined by `agent_id` to the lifecycle stream |
//! | [`TimelineItem::Worker`] | **NO SOURCE.** §12-verbatim `WorkerRun`; never constructed here. |
//! | [`TimelineItem::Plan`] | **NO SOURCE.** `plan` updates are Phase-2 machinery. |
//! | [`TimelineItem::Approval`] | **NO SOURCE.** Nothing asks the CEO to approve anything. |
//! | [`TimelineItem::Question`] | **NO SOURCE.** There is no `waiting_for_user` state. |
//! | [`TimelineItem::Artifact`] | **NO SOURCE.** Phase 5 owns artifacts and provenance. |
//!
//! ### The message phase, stated plainly
//! §22's required change to `stream.rs` is *"one undifferentiated assistant text stream"*
//! → *"message phase plus typed activity events"*. This module delivers the typed activity
//! events and the phase TYPE. It does not deliver a phase SIGNAL, because none exists:
//! every assistant token in this runtime arrives on one channel with nothing marking where
//! commentary ends and the answer begins. So every CEO turn's prose is
//! [`RichMessagePhase::Unknown`].
//!
//! Guessing would be cheap and wrong. The obvious heuristic — "the last run is the final
//! answer" — is false the moment Rich runs one more verification command after writing his
//! conclusion, and the CEO reads the final response as the deliverable, so mislabelling
//! commentary as final is a product defect rather than a cosmetic one. `Unknown` is the
//! honest answer until the emitter is taught to open a message with a phase
//! (§13 `rich://message-started`).
//!
//! What this module DOES contribute toward that split is structural: a turn's prose is no
//! longer one blob. It is one item per contiguous run of the shared sequence
//! (`ledger::TextRun`), so "he said X, then ran Y, then said Z" is three items with real
//! positions, and the phase field is the only thing still missing.
//!
//! ### Workers, stated plainly — the signal landed, and what it still cannot say
//! §22 names active worker count, worker waiting state and completion state as things that
//! must not be faked. When slice 2a was written there was no engine lifecycle signal at
//! all, so [`WorkerRun`] and [`TimelineItem::Worker`] had no constructor and a delegated
//! `Task` call became an ordinary [`TimelineItem::Activity`].
//!
//! The engine landed the signal at `d14bc54` (`engine/docs/worker-lifecycle-events.md`), so
//! a `Task` call **joined to a real `agent_id`** now becomes a
//! [`TimelineItem::WorkerActivity`]. Three things about that join are load-bearing:
//!
//! 1. **It joins by IDENTITY, never by name and never by timing proximity.** The witness is
//!    the same one `worker-created-handoff.sh` uses — the harness's async-launch
//!    acknowledgement *and* an extractable `agentId` — read from the tool call's own raw
//!    payload. A `Task` call with no extractable id, or an id with no row in the stream,
//!    stays an ordinary `Activity`, exactly as before.
//! 2. **The join is SESSION-SCOPED.** `agent_id` is the join key but it is not globally
//!    unique across sessions, so a row is admitted only when its `session_id` matches the
//!    record's. Without that clause another session's worker name and authored summary
//!    render inside this entity's thread on a row that looks perfectly scoped — the same
//!    shape of leak slice 2a found in the `toolCallId` merge. See
//!    `no_worker_row_from_another_session_attaches_to_this_sessions_task_call`.
//! 3. **Only the four observable states cross the boundary.** The stream witnesses
//!    `created`, `started`, `updated` and `run_ended`; `waiting`, `interrupted` and `failed`
//!    have no witness at all (see [`crate::worker_events`]). `run_ended` maps to
//!    [`RUN_ENDED_WORKER_STATE`], which is [`WorkerState::Unknown`] — **not**
//!    [`WorkerState::Completed`].
//!
//! [`TimelineItem::Worker`] and [`WorkerRun`] are untouched and still have no constructor:
//! they are §12-verbatim and carry fields (`result_ref`, `error_ref`, `completed_at`) that
//! nothing witnesses.
