//! The MACHINERY seam — every non-text frame the agent emits, routed instead of dropped.
//!
//! Built to `docs/plans/richos-techy-mode-2026-08-26.md` (Sage, 2026-08-26), Phase 1
//! (§5). **Re-based 2026-08-31 from the ACP adapter's `session/update` vocabulary onto the
//! NATIVE `claude` binary's stream-json stdio** (`wiki/ceo-decisions.md` §16 — *"the adapter
//! goes"*), against the frames actually captured in
//! `docs/verification/native-claude-stream-json-2026-08-31/raw/` and
//! `docs/verification/native-claude-tool-status-2026-08-31/raw/`. Where the design's
//! field-level assumptions and the wire disagree, the wire wins and the deviation is named
//! here.
//!
//! ## Why a second event family, and not new `StreamEvent` variants
//! `stream.rs:8-10` states the clean-output invariant as a property of the type: *"the
//! ONLY text that ever reaches a chunk event is assistant-message text … Tool calls,
//! worker chatter, hooks, and machinery have no path here at all."* Design §1.1/§1.3: if
//! machinery became a `StreamEvent`, that invariant would degrade from **structural** to
//! *"the renderer remembers to filter"*. So machinery travels on its own record, its own
//! observer trait, and its own Tauri event name — `rich://machinery` — and the default
//! UI's subscription list is the proof.
//!
//! ## ONE event name, deliberately (design §1.3)
//! `stream.rs` and `voice/event.rs` use one Tauri event per semantic event because those
//! sets are OURS and closed. The agent's frame set is the VENDOR's and open. One name plus
//! a `kind` field means a new vendor frame needs no new event, no new subscription, and no
//! contract revision.
//!
//! ## ONE frame can be SEVERAL records, and that is new
//! [`MachineryRecord::from_native_event`] returns a `Vec`, where the ACP normalizer it
//! replaces returned an `Option`. This is forced by the wire, not chosen: an `assistant`
//! frame carries `message.content` as an ARRAY, and one frame can hold a `thinking` block
//! AND a `tool_use` block. Collapsing them into one record would invent a fact. The
//! caller advances the shared per-turn `seq` (§1.4 G1) by exactly the number of records it
//! delivered, so the counter still numbers *delivered items*, exactly as before.
//!
//! ## What is retained, and the SIX drops, every one of them declared
//! Typed here: tool calls (opened from `tool_use`, closed from `tool_result`, kept alive by
//! `tool_progress`), `thinking`, the client-directed `can_use_tool` permission request, and
//! `Unknown`.
//!
//! Everything not typed — `system/init`, `system/status`, `system/thinking_tokens`,
//! `rate_limit_event`, `control_response`, `stream_event/message_delta` — falls to
//! `MachineryKind::Unknown`, which retains the vendor frame type as the title and the
//! verbatim payload. §1.4 G5 forbids re-introducing a silent drop.
//!
//! **The complete drop set on this wire. Nothing else returns no record:**
//!
//! 1. `stream_event → content_block_delta → text_delta` — THE clean-output text path, the
//!    native equivalent of ACP's `agent_message_chunk`. It reaches the CEO as
//!    `StreamEvent::Chunk` and a machinery copy would be a second source of truth for the
//!    reply.
//! 2. `assistant` frames' `text` blocks — the same fact in whole-message form, already
//!    delivered by (1).
//! 3. `user` frames' `text` blocks — **the ONE deliberate drop §1.2 named**, ported intact.
//!    `ledger.rs:386-409` already holds the CEO's words verbatim and fsync'd, and the stop
//!    control already records a stop, so neither an echoed prompt nor the CLI's injected
//!    `[Request interrupted by user]` marker may become a second source of truth. (Measured:
//!    `raw/run9-rust-driven.jsonl` carries exactly two `user` frames — one `tool_result`,
//!    one that interrupt marker — and **never our own prompt**, so on this wire the rule
//!    guards the marker rather than the echo.)
//! 4. The streaming ENVELOPE — `message_start`, `message_stop`, `content_block_stop`, and
//!    `content_block_start` for `text`/`thinking` blocks. They carry no fact of their own;
//!    they bracket (1).
//! 5. `input_json_delta` / `thinking_delta` / `signature_delta` — FRAGMENTS whose complete
//!    value arrives verbatim on the following `assistant` frame. Twenty-five
//!    `content_block_delta`s in one measured turn (`run9`); retaining them would be N
//!    partial copies of one fact, which is §1.2's own argument one level down.
//! 6. `result` — the turn TERMINAL. The driver returns its stop reason from `prompt`,
//!    exactly as the ACP path returned the `session/prompt` response and recorded no
//!    machinery for it.
//!
//! ## The watermark measurement is DERIVED here, not given
//! ACP emitted `usage_update {used, size}` outright. The native wire gives the numerator
//! and the denominator in different frames and at different times, so
//! [`MachineryRecord::from_context_usage`] builds an explicitly DERIVED record and
//! [`MachineryRecord::context_usage`] reads it back. `used` is
//! `stream_event/message_delta`'s `usage.input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens +
//! cache_creation_input_tokens` (mid-turn, observed monotonic 29,342 → 30,113 in `run9`);
//! `size` is `result.modelUsage[<session model>].contextWindow` = 1,000,000 for
//! `claude-sonnet-5`, which arrives only when a turn ENDS. **Caveat C3 of the spike is real
//! and is honoured rather than papered over:** the first turn of a fresh lease has a
//! numerator and no denominator, so no record is emitted at all and the spine stays on its
//! chars÷4 estimate until a turn completes.
//!
//! ## Deviations forced by measured wire data
//! 1. **`tool_progress` keys on `parent_tool_use_id`, never `tool_use_id`.** Its own
//!    `tool_use_id` is a synthetic `<real-id>-heartbeat-<n>` that matches no row anywhere
//!    (`native-claude-tool-status-2026-08-31/findings.md`). Keying on the obvious field
//!    silently updates nothing.
//! 2. **A `tool_use` content-block START carries `input: {}`.** The complete arguments
//!    arrive on the following whole-message `assistant` frame, so §1.4 G2's merge is
//!    mandatory, not an optimization — the same conclusion the ACP path reached for a
//!    different reason.
//! 3. **There is no `status` string on this wire.** Status is a POSITION: `tool_use` opens
//!    `Pending`, `tool_progress` means `InProgress`, `tool_result` closes `Completed` or
//!    `Failed` from its boolean `is_error`. `ToolStatus::Other` is retained for a wire that
//!    starts carrying one.
//! 4. **`locations` does not exist.** Paths are extracted from the tool's own `input`
//!    (`file_path`, `path`, `notebook_path`) and from `tool_use_result.filePath`.
//! 5. **The SessionMeta suppression key ignores `uuid`.** Four `system/init` frames in
//!    `run9` differ ONLY by a per-frame `uuid`, so a verbatim-equality slot would suppress
//!    nothing and the "last value wins" rule would be dead code. See [`meta_identity`].
//!
//! ## What this file must NEVER do — a licence condition, not a preference
//! RichOS may never collect, store, or intermediate Claude credentials or session tokens
//! (`docs/research/claude-code-redistribution-2026-08-31.md`; `ceo-decisions.md` §16). The
//! `control_response` to `initialize` carries an `account` object with the customer's email
//! and subscription type. **It is not normalized here and the driver never retains it** —
//! see `native.rs`'s handshake, which reads that response for liveness only and keeps none
//! of it.
