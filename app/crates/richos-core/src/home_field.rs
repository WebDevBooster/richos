//! THE HOME SCREEN'S PICTURE, COMPILED FROM THE CUSTOMER'S OWN CORPUS.
//!
//! `app/ui/home.js` (the banner block, lines 240-285) names the seam this file closes, and
//! names it precisely because it was not built:
//!
//! > What is missing is a command — call it `home_field_data` — that compiles that corpus
//! > into the `{meta, nodes, links, sources, ...}` structure `home/field-*.js` reads, and
//! > stamps its `meta` with `"synthetic": false` plus the corpus root it came from.
//!
//! This module is the compiling half. The Tauri command is `main.rs::home_field_data`; the
//! preference — WHEN the picture stops being the demonstration and becomes his — is a
//! constant in `home.js` and is deliberately not decided here. See "What this does not
//! decide" below.
//!
//! # The structure is NOT designed here
//!
//! It is `app/ui/home/field-prep.js`'s, exactly. `prepare(loro, REF, V)` reads
//! `loro.nodes[]` (`id, type, domain, cluster, degree, significance, activity, recency,
//! createdDay`), `loro.links[]` (`s, t, class, cross`), `loro.domains[]`
//! (`id, label, nodeCount, clusters[{id, label, nodeCount}]`), `loro.sources[]`
//! (`id, kind, domain, ingestedDay, primaryNodeId, derivedCount`) and
//! `loro.meta.horizonDays`; `field-engine.js` additionally reads `loro.bragSignals` and
//! `loro.specialists`. Every key emitted below is one of those. Nothing new is invented and
//! nothing consumed is left out.
//!
//! # NO CORPUS CONTENT CROSSES THIS BOUNDARY
//!
//! The rule `loro.rs` states for itself, applied to a payload that reaches a webview. A
//! record's title, its ref and its file path are the CEO's own words and file names, and the
//! field renders **none of them** — `field-engine.js:969-970` labels a node
//! `"<Type> · <Domain label>"` and nothing else, and a cluster label is never drawn at all.
//! So what leaves here is SHAPE: how many objects, of which kinds, in which company, drawn
//! out of how many distinct sources, and which of them came from the same source. Node,
//! cluster and source ids are opaque ordinals. The one identifying string in the payload is
//! the company label, which is already on the entity row directly above the picture.
//!
//! # WHAT THE READ SEAM CANNOT SUPPLY, said plainly rather than filled in
//!
//! Measured against the CEO's own corpus on 2026-09-06 (`/Users/alex/ab/richos-hq`, 713
//! records, `layout: repo`, 6 partitions):
//!
//!   * **There is no enumeration.** `loro-context.mjs` has three verbs — `compile`, `fetch`
//!     and `corpus`. `compile` is topic-ranked behind a relative relevance floor
//!     (`loro/lib/relevance.js`, `FLOOR_FRACTION: 0.15`), so it answers a QUERY; asking it
//!     for everything is not a thing it does, and `corpus` returns a census and no records.
//!     So the picture is the UNION of one query per company he has (see [`field_topics`]),
//!     and against his corpus that union is **168 objects of 713 records** — 6 compiles,
//!     2.795 s wall clock, measured 2026-09-06. `meta.query.topics` lists every question
//!     that was asked, and `meta.counts.records` beside `meta.counts.objects` puts the gap
//!     in front of the caller instead of hiding it.
//!   * **There are no dates.** A slice item carries `ref, kind, title, scope, kindInferred,
//!     company, score, confidence, provenance` — no observation date. So `createdDay` is 0
//!     against a `horizonDays` far beyond it, which makes `field-prep.js`'s
//!     `createdDay >= horizonDays - 14` false for every node: **nothing is drawn as new**,
//!     rather than everything being drawn as new off an invented date.
//!   * **There is no link graph.** Inter-record citations are not exposed. The links emitted
//!     here are the one real relation available — two objects compiled out of the same
//!     source file — and they are `class: "membership"`. No `cross: true` link is emitted at
//!     all, because a cross-domain relation would be a claim nothing here can support.
//!   * **There is no per-company census.** `corpus` counts the whole corpus by kind and by
//!     nothing else, so `domains[].nodeCount` counts the objects actually drawn and not his
//!     corpus's true per-company size.
//!   * **loro knows nothing about specialists, tasks or minutes.** `bragSignals` therefore
//!     carries real numbers for the things the corpus does know and **zero** for the ones it
//!     does not, and `meta.absent` names every one of them.
//!
//! # What this does not decide
//!
//! Whether the picture is good enough to replace the demonstration. It reports counts and
//! stops. The CEO's instruction for this work is explicit — *"The demo is definitely needed,
//! initially, for the user"* — and how a handover should look is the subject of
//! `richos-hq/design/mockups/rounds/round-11.4` (v1 First Light, v2 The Ghost, v3 Named,
//! v4 Arrival, v5 The Compass), which is unruled. `home.js`'s `HOME_FIELD_MIN_OBJECTS` is
//! the one place that preference lives.
