//! THE READ SEAM, WIRED — company memory reaching a re-prime, and the guard on the way in.
//!
//! `reprime.rs` has carried a `LoroContextCompiler` trait since the continuity foundation
//! landed, and nothing ever implemented it. The compiler itself has been complete and
//! versioned the whole time, one directory away, behind `loro/CONTEXT-CONTRACT.md`. So
//! every re-prime asserted a fresh Rich into existence with **no company memory at all**
//! while the thing that would have supplied it sat there callable. This module is the
//! implementation, and it is the only place in richos-core that knows loro exists.
//!
//! # What crosses the boundary, and what must not
//!
//! `richos` GOES PUBLIC. Loro's content is the CEO's second brain and is private by
//! construction — it is not in this repo and never will be. Everything here is *mechanism*:
//! how to invoke a binary that lives elsewhere, how to parse a documented JSON shape, and
//! what to refuse. **No corpus content, no corrections, no speech.** The corpus root is
//! read from the environment at runtime and is never defaulted — `CONTEXT-CONTRACT.md` §1
//! is explicit that a default root means "a customer's Rich silently answering out of the
//! VENDOR's company memory, and exiting 0 either way", which it correctly calls a larger
//! failure than an error, not a smaller one.
//!
//! # The read-only invariant is not weakened, and could not be from here
//!
//! Loro's compiler is read-only by structural proof: `assertNoSideEffects` scans every
//! module under `loro/lib/**` for a filesystem write (`privacy.js`), which is why a
//! persistent index cannot live in the compiler at all. Nothing in this file can change
//! that — it invokes `bin/loro-context.mjs` as a child process and reads stdout. What it
//! CAN do is smuggle a write in through the same door, so it doesn't: [`CliContextCompiler`]
//! holds no writer, cannot name one, and a test asserts its argv contains no write verb.
//! Writing is a different type reaching a different binary (`correction.rs`), and it only
//! ever runs after the CEO has said yes.

/// WHERE LORO IS, resolved ONCE, for every consumer.
///
/// # Why this type exists at all
///
/// On 2026-09-01 the same premise failure — *"read your configuration from an environment
/// variable a real launch does not have"* — was found and fixed three times in one day: the
/// engine directory (`engine.rs`), the corpus READ path ([`resolve_corpus`], landed at
/// `46d8f56`), and then the corpus WRITE path, one file over, which never got the twin.
/// The obvious fourth move was a `CliLoroWriter::locate` repeating the reader's candidate
/// walk. **That would have been the third near-identical resolver, and three near-identical
/// resolvers is how the fourth one gets forgotten** — which is the mechanism that produced
/// the defect this type closes.
///
/// So resolution happens here, once, and both halves of loro are BUILT FROM THE RESULT:
/// [`CliContextCompiler::from_install`] reads, `correction::CliLoroWriter::from_install`
/// writes. The agreement property — *the reader and the writer are looking at the same
/// corpus* — is therefore structural rather than merely tested for. It is still tested for,
/// because a future edit could reintroduce a second walk, and the test is what would catch
/// it.
///
/// Why that agreement matters more than either half on its own: a build where the read path
/// resolves one root and the write path another shows the CEO a proposal computed against
/// one record and writes his confirmation into a different corpus. That is worse than the
/// dead desk it replaced — a dead desk refuses, a disagreeing pair succeeds and is wrong.
