//! THE COMPANY LAYER — what is true about the company a thread belongs to, brought back on
//! every launch.
//!
//! # Why this module is the difference between an interview and a questionnaire
//!
//! `docs/plans/richos-onboarding-2026-09-06.md` §6 states the rule the bootstrap interview
//! lives or dies by: *"Every answer must reach something."* A stage whose answers silently go
//! nowhere turns onboarding back into a form. So before an interview may be offered at all,
//! there has to be a place its answers land AND a code path that reads them back — and until
//! this module existed there was neither.
//!
//! **The measurement that rules out the obvious place.** The interview's generation phase G1
//! fills `CLAUDE.md`. The Claude process RichOS drives **does not read a `CLAUDE.md`**, because
//! `native.rs::child_args` passes `--setting-sources ''`. Measured three ways on 2026-09-06
//! against `claude` 2.1.263, under the exact production chat-lease vector, in
//! `docs/verification/onboarding-honesty-2026-09-06/`:
//!
//! | cell | `--setting-sources` | `CLAUDE.md` in cwd | reply |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | B0a | `''` (production) | present, carrying three invented facts | `unknown` / `unknown` / `unknown` |
//! | B0b | `project` (positive control) | the same file | `Harborline` / `CLEATHITCH-8842` / `make ripcurl` |
//! | B0c | `project` (negative control) | **absent** | `unknown` / `unknown` / `unknown` |
//!
//! B0b proves B0a's null is a true negative rather than a model declining to answer; B0c proves
//! the three facts have no source in the world other than that file. So **provisioning a
//! `CLAUDE.md` for the app is the wrong wiring**, and the onboarding document's M1/M2 — bridge
//! the app's config into `engine/identity.config` and call `provision-claude-md.sh` — would fix a
//! chain whose far end is a file nothing reads.
//!
//! # The channel that IS open, and why it is this one
//!
//! `docs/plans/richos-central-folder-2026-09-06.md` §4.1 settles it, and the coupling was already
//! in the code before anything was written for it:
//!
//! - The doctrine file (`doctrine.rs`) is fixed at spawn and its §4.1 boundary rule forbids a
//!   company name in it — **one lease serves many companies**. `spine.rs` holds a single chat
//!   lease and switches threads underneath it, so a company in that process's system prompt would
//!   become a lie the moment the CEO switched.
//! - The **priming turn** re-fires on every thread change (`prime_lease_if_needed`), and thread →
//!   entity is one-to-one and immutable. So the priming turn is *already* scoped exactly to the
//!   company boundary, with no new trigger to build. What was missing was content.
//!
//! That is the whole of this module: read one file at prime time, render it into the scoped
//! assertion, and refuse — visibly — in every case where it cannot be done honestly.
//!
//! # THE FILE IS MATERIAL, NEVER INSTRUCTIONS
//!
//! Central-folder §4.1's second constraint, inherited rather than invented: *"It is the company's
//! material, not the company's instructions to Rich … or a company file becomes an injection
//! surface."* [`CompanyLayer::render_for_priming`] frames every byte as something the CEO said,
//! and says so in the payload, because the alternative is that whoever can write that file can
//! rewrite Rich. The framing is not decoration; it is the boundary.
//!
//! # THE BUDGET, AND WHY OVER-BUDGET IS A REFUSAL RATHER THAN A TRUNCATION
//!
//! This text is re-sent on every prime and therefore on every company switch, which is a heavier
//! duty than the doctrine file's (that one is cached in the system prefix; this one is a turn).
//! [`COMPANY_BUDGET_BYTES`] is **8192**, and the arithmetic rather than a feeling: the shipping
//! doctrine measured 3,505 bytes, and 8 KB is a little over twice that, or roughly 2,000 tokens
//! at four bytes per token, re-spent on every rotation of every thread. That the number is a
//! **decision** rather than a measurement is stated rather than hidden — but it was sized
//! against the real files rather than against nothing. All six company files that shipped with
//! the central folder, measured 2026-09-06 with
//! `for f in ~/myrichos/companies/*/company.md; do wc -c < "$f"; done`:
//!
//! ```text
//! 2991  femcboost      2726  prospects
//! 2971  deeply         2355  webinar-booster
//! 2828  richos         2334  gpt-exporter
//! ```
//!
//! So the budget is 2.7x the largest company file that exists, and every one of the six is
//! inside it with room for an interview to add to it.
//!
//! **A file over budget is NOT truncated.** Half a house rule is a wrong house rule, and it would
//! be wrong silently — the exact defect class this repository spent 2026-09-06 removing from
//! `--plugin-dir`. Over budget is [`CompanyLayer::TooLarge`], which contributes nothing to the
//! priming turn and which `onboarding.rs` reports as a broken link, so the app declines to offer
//! an interview it could not store the answers to.
