//! THE SKILLS RichOS gives its inner Rich — the on-demand half of `doctrine.rs`.
//!
//! # The question this module exists because somebody measured
//!
//! The engine ships 28 skills, and they reach the ORCHESTRATOR because the engine is registered
//! as a plugin in `~/.claude/settings.json` — a **user** settings file. `native.rs::child_args`
//! passes `--setting-sources ''`, which is the same flag that stops `CLAUDE.md` loading, and it
//! drops user, project and local settings alike. So none of them reached the inner Rich, and a
//! customer has no `~/.claude/settings.json` of ours in the first place.
//!
//! **Measured on 2026-09-06 against `claude` 2.1.263, not read off documentation**
//! (`docs/verification/inner-doctrine-skills-2026-09-06/`). The `system/init` frame carries a
//! `skills` array and a `plugins` array, so *"was it discovered"* is a fact on the wire rather
//! than an inference from whether the model happened to use it:
//!
//! | cell | delivery | `--setting-sources` | in `init.skills`? |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | K0 | `<cwd>/.claude/skills/rig-status/` | `''` (production) | **no** |
//! | K1 | the same directory | `project` | **yes** — so K0's null is a true negative |
//! | K2 | `--plugin-dir <path>` | `''` (production) | **yes**, as `rig-probe:rig-status` |
//! | K3 | the same, question asked | `''` | **invoked**: `Skill{"skill":"rig-probe:rig-status"}` |
//! | K4 | `--plugin-dir <missing path>` | `''` | **no, and SILENTLY** — exit 0, clean handshake |
//!
//! `--plugin-dir` is therefore the channel, and it is the same shape as
//! `--append-system-prompt-file`: an explicit flag naming a directory **RichOS wrote and owns**,
//! opening no settings source and reversing no stated intent. Not the operator's `~/.claude`,
//! not the visited folder — the CEO ruled that authority comes from what RichOS writes, never
//! from the folder it stands in.
//!
//! # K4 IS THE REASON HALF THIS MODULE EXISTS
//!
//! `--append-system-prompt-file` gave us the loud failure for free: a missing file is
//! `Error: Append system prompt file not found`, exit 1, zero bytes of stdout. **`--plugin-dir`
//! does not.** A path that is not there produces a successful handshake, `plugins: []`, and a
//! perfectly ordinary turn — which is precisely the quiet degradation this whole evening was
//! about. So the loudness is ours to build, in two layers:
//!
//! 1. **Before the spawn.** [`verify_present`] checks the manifest and every SKILL.md this
//!    build declares, and `native.rs::preflight` turns any gap into `NativeError::SkillsMissing`
//!    naming the path. That catches deleted, truncated and unreadable.
//! 2. **On the wire.** A directory that exists and that the binary *rejects* would still be
//!    silent — a schema this version does not accept, a name collision, a future change. So the
//!    reader thread checks the first `system/init` frame's `plugins` array for [`PLUGIN_NAME`]
//!    and reports its absence loudly ([`NativeClient::skills_verdict`]). **This is a mitigation
//!    `--permission-prompt-tool` cannot have**: `native.rs`'s module doc records that the
//!    initialize reply carries no field naming the permission prompt tool, so there is nothing
//!    to assert against. Here the field exists, so it is asserted against.
//!
//! # The boundary: what is a skill and what is a clause in the doctrine file
//!
//! It is not "what is always true" any more. `doctrine.rs` §4.1's rule still decides what may
//! appear at all; this second rule decides which of the two channels carries it:
//!
//! | | the doctrine file | a skill |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | when it arrives | fixed at spawn, in the cached prefix of **every** request | on demand, when the model reaches for it |
//! | what it costs | every byte, every turn, forever | nothing on the turns it is not used |
//! | so it may hold | what must be in force **before Rich has read anything** | what he can be told **when the moment arrives** |
//! | and it must be | short, and free of examples | as long, worked and exampled as the rule really is |
//!
//! **American English is the case that needs both halves, and that is a finding rather than a
//! hedge.** It governs every string he writes, so a one-line rule stays in the doctrine file —
//! and it had to, because the model went British on the first product-shaped question with no
//! clause at all. But §13's actual rule is not one line: it binds text a person reads and
//! explicitly does NOT bind code identifiers, file names, third-party API values or quoted
//! external material, and a model given only the short form has to guess the exceptions. The
//! long form, with its table and its five exclusions, is 3.2 KB — it would be a permanent tax on
//! every turn in the prefix, and it costs nothing as a skill.
//!
//! # What is deliberately NOT here
//!
//! **The engine's other 27 skills.** They are orchestration mechanics for a developer team —
//! `using-git-worktrees`, `rich-lander`, the QA and native-build skills — and they are wrong
//! instruction for a chief of staff talking to a non-technical CEO. §4.3's rule about the team
//! directory applies to them word for word: an instruction to do something the app cannot do is
//! worse than silence, because it lies. Which of the 27 are candidates is the CEO's list to
//! shape, not this module's.
