//! ACTION-LEDGER WRITER invariants — the fix for the v1 correctness bug in which
//! `Ledger::record_action` had NO production caller, so the action ledger was
//! permanently EMPTY at runtime while `reprime.rs`'s identity assertion told every
//! rotated session that it was "ground truth for what Rich has done — authoritative."
//! The anti-false-attribution guarantee of the continuity design (§5.4 / §6.1) rested
//! on nothing, and — like the dictation bug — it failed SILENTLY while appearing to work.
//!
//! These tests are the proof that the claim is now true rather than aspirational:
//! actions are written by PRODUCTION code paths (never by the test itself), they are
//! non-empty at runtime, they survive a rotation into the successor's priming prompt,
//! and the machinery half never leaks into it.
//!
//! Headless throughout (`MockCognition` / `MockLeaseFactory`): no live Claude, no network.
//! Test names document the invariant, per this codebase's convention.
