//! **NOTHING GOES OUTBOUND.** The CEO's constraint on the feedback channel's v1 half,
//! asserted mechanically instead of promised in a comment.
//!
//! # Why this suite is not in `feedback.rs`
//!
//! Most of what follows reads the feedback module's own source and fails on tokens that
//! would indicate a way off this machine. If the check lived inside the file it reads,
//! its own list of banned tokens would be in the text being scanned, and the test would
//! either fail against itself or have to be written in an obfuscated way that nobody can
//! review. It lives one directory over, where the list can be plain.
//!
//! # What "no outbound path" is taken to mean, stated so it can be argued with
//!
//! Three separate claims, each with its own test, because they fail independently:
//!
//! 1. **The feature contains no transport.** No socket, no client, no address, no
//!    subprocess — checked against the module's code with its comments removed, so the
//!    words in the prose above cannot make the check pass or fail.
//! 2. **The crate could not reach the network if it wanted to.** `richos-core` depends on
//!    four crates, none of which can open a connection. A dependency added later fails
//!    this test by name, which is the point: the person adding it has to say what it is.
//! 3. **Nothing else in the crate consumes the feature.** The module is reachable only
//!    from the crate root. It is not wired into the ACP client, the spine, or anything
//!    else that already talks to a subprocess, so there is no existing pipe for a report
//!    to be handed to.
//!
//! And one behavioral claim: recording an approval touches exactly one file and leaves
//! no second artefact — no spool, no marker, no "unsent" shard that a later version could
//! find and flush.

///
/// That string is not a network primitive and cannot become one. An XML namespace is
/// IDENTIFIED by a URI and is never dereferenced — no user agent fetches it — and the SVG
/// specification requires this exact literal. `document.createElementNS` takes the same
/// literal for the same reason, which is why `settings-button.js` holds it as a constant.
/// Rewriting it to dodge a checker would be obfuscation, and obfuscation is the one response
/// to a guard that is worse than deleting it.
///
/// THE NARROWING IS TWO EXACT STRINGS, not a pattern and not a syntax. Only the literal SVG
/// and xlink namespace URIs are removed, in any position; every other URL in these files
/// still fails, including an `xmlns` pointing anywhere else.
/// `a_planted_namespace_shaped_url_is_still_caught` is the proof, and it is the reason this
