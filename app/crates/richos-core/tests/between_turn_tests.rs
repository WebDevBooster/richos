//! BETWEEN-TURN TRAFFIC AGAINST A REAL CHILD PROCESS — techy-mode design §1.5, gap #1.
//!
//! *"the client delivers a frame only if `current_prompt` is `Some`. Anything the agent
//! emits at session start or between turns hits no sink at all."*
//!
//! **Ported from the ACP wire to the native `claude` wire (`wiki/ceo-decisions.md` §16).**
//! Same three tests, same three invariants, plus one the old wire could not express (see
//! the watermark test below). They do not mock `NativeClient`: they spawn a real child over
//! real stdio and drive the real handshake, the real reader thread, real `dispatch`, real
//! between-turn buffer, following `native_cancel_tests.rs`'s POSIX-`sh` fake agent exactly —
//! so nothing here needs Claude, a network, Node, or the `claude` binary.
//!
//! The agent emits its `system/init` at TWO moments the real one was measured emitting it
//! (`docs/verification/native-claude-stream-json-2026-08-31/raw/run9-rust-driven.jsonl`, four
//! `system/init` frames across four turns): once at session start, and once after the turn's
//! `result` has already been returned. Both are moments when `current_prompt` is `None`,
//! which is the whole point.
//!
//! **And the repeat is NOT byte-identical, which is the change from the ACP version of this
//! file.** The measured `system/init` frames differ by a per-frame `uuid`, so the fake
//! differs by one too — and the suppression assertion below therefore proves
//! `machinery::meta_identity` is doing real work rather than getting lucky on a fixture that
//! was easier to write than the wire is.
//!
//! ## Why these poll instead of sleeping a fixed time
//! The trailing frames are written by the child AFTER the `result` that unblocks `prompt`,
//! so the reader thread may not have consumed them when `prompt` returns. A fixed sleep
//! would be either flaky or slow. `wait_for` polls to a deadline and FAILS with what it
//! actually saw, so a real regression reads as a regression rather than as a timeout.
