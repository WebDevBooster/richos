//! **THE LAUNCH RECORD NEVER LEAVES THIS MACHINE.** Asserted mechanically, not promised.
//!
//! The CEO ruled on 2026-08-31 that the splash's tracking data is *"local only, never
//! outbound — the same guarantee the feedback channel carries"*, and named the reason it has
//! to be held to the identical standard: it is a record of his own working life. When he
//! opens the app, how often, how long he has had it, what he has been shown. A product that
//! sent that anywhere would be doing the one thing this product exists not to do.
//!
//! # Why this suite is not in `launch.rs`
//!
//! Same reason `feedback_no_outbound_tests.rs` is not in `feedback.rs`: most of what follows
//! reads the module's own source and fails on tokens that would indicate a way off this
//! machine. A check that lived inside the file it reads would either fail against itself or
//! have to be written so obliquely that nobody could review it.
//!
//! # Why it is a SECOND suite rather than four more tests in the feedback one
//!
//! Because they are two different claims about two different call graphs, and folding them
//! together would make each one's failure ambiguous. They are deliberately the same SHAPE —
//! this file reuses that one's structure and its needle lists almost verbatim — so a reader
//! who has understood one has understood both.
//!
//! # The four claims, each failing independently
//!
//! 1. **The module contains no transport.** No socket, no client, no address, no
//!    subprocess — checked against `launch.rs` with its comments removed, so the prose above
//!    cannot make the check pass or fail.
//! 2. **The crate could not reach the network if it wanted to.** Four dependencies, none
//!    network-capable. A fifth fails this by name.
//! 3. **Nothing else in the crate consumes it,** so the record cannot be slipped into a pipe
//!    that already exists — `native.rs` in this same crate does talk to another program.
//! 4. **The shell's two launch commands, and everything they call, contain no transport,**
//!    and neither does the web layer that reaches them. The module having no way out would
//!    mean nothing if the surface on top of it had one.
//!
//! And one behavioral claim: a full run — begin, show a splash, fire a reward, quit —
//! leaves exactly one file and no second artefact for a later version to find and flush.
