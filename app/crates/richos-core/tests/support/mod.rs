//! SHARED TEST FIXTURE: the entity registry these suites run against.
//!
//! # Why this file exists
//!
//! Until 2026-09-04 `Spine::new` arrived holding a compiled-in registry —
//! `EntityRegistry::CEOS_COMPANIES`, a `const` table of the CEO's six real companies bound
//! to absolute roots under his own home directory — and `impl Default for EntityRegistry`
//! returned it, so that table was the SHIPPING registry of every copy of RichOS ever built.
//! Every suite in `tests/` inherited it for free and said `Spine::new(ledger)`.
//!
//! The registry is per-user now (`entity.rs` rule 4): it is read from `entities.json` in the
//! install's own configuration directory and a bare `Spine` accepts NO entity until the shell
//! installs one. So the suites declare theirs, here, once — which is also what the app does
//! at boot, and therefore a more honest fixture than the one it replaces.
//!
//! # About the ids
//!
//! They are the ids the existing suites were written against, and they are kept because much
//! of the surrounding commentary is a durable record of real incidents and measurements —
//! renaming the subject of a measurement makes the record wrong. **Nothing here ships.**
//! `tests/` is not compiled into the app, the roots below exist on no machine, and the
//! product's own default registry is empty and belongs to nobody (see
//! `entity_registry_tests::the_shipping_default_registry_is_empty`).
