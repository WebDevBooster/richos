//! THE INTAKE LOG SURVIVES A RECORD IT CANNOT READ, AND SAYS SO.
//!
//! `steering.rs`'s intake log is the one file that holds what the CEO TYPED before it
//! becomes anything: a steering message he entered while Rich was working (UX §9.2) or a
//! stop he pressed (§9.3), fsync'd the instant he acted and not yet drained into the
//! ledger. Until 2026-09-05 the replay dropped any record it could not parse with no
//! count, no log line and no trace — a message he sent that never arrives and that nobody
//! ever learns was lost.
//!
//! **Every test here is worthless without `nothing_at_all_is_skipped_on_an_untouched_log`.**
//! A reader that skips everything passes every "the damage was reported" test in this file
//! and fails the only one that matters, so that test comes first and is the anti-vacuous
//! floor for the rest.
//!
//! Every fixture is built by the REAL writer (`IntakeLog::steer` / `::stop` /
//! `::mark_drained`) and then edited, so no test here can pass against a shape the product
//! does not actually write.
