//! **THE BEHAVIORAL SENTINEL** — does the standing instruction actually reach the model?
//!
//! Every other test in this repository proves the flag is in the argument vector and that a
//! missing file is a refusal. Neither of those answers the question the whole feature is
//! about: `--append-system-prompt-file` is **semi-documented** (named only inside `--bare`'s
//! description, absent from the flag list), and it lives in a binary that self-updates
//! underneath the product — four versions sat in `~/.local/share/claude/versions/` on this
//! machine while `native.rs` was being written, and one of them landed mid-build. A release
//! that still passes the flag to a binary which has quietly stopped honoring it ships a
//! generic Claude behind the product's window, with a clean handshake and no error anywhere.
//!
//! So this is a **release gate, not a one-off** (inner-doctrine design §7.4): run it against
//! the binary a release actually ships against, and record the result with that binary's
//! version number.
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo test -p richos-core --test doctrine_sentinel -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! `#[ignore]` because it costs a real API turn against the customer's own subscription and
//! needs a signed-in `claude`; `cargo test` must stay free and offline. **`ignored` is what
//! libtest prints, in its own column, so a run that did not check reads as a not-run rather
//! than as a pass** — the standard `setup.rs`'s own live test sets.
//!
//! # The design, and why each part of it is there (§7.3)
//!
//! - **Two cells against the REAL binary through the PRODUCT'S OWN argument vector and the
//!   product's own locator.** `NativeCognition::start` and `resolve_claude_bin`, not a
//!   reimplementation of either — a sentinel that drives a second copy of the arg vector
//!   proves something about the copy.
//! - **The sentinel carries a BEHAVIOR and a token with no other source in the world.** Begin
//!   every reply with `Acknowledged.`, plus `TOPGALLANT-6641` and `make kedge`. The behavior
//!   is what makes a null result informative: a child that read the file and declined to echo
//!   the token would still have opened with `Acknowledged.`
//! - **The control must return NEITHER.** It is the same binary, the same locator, the same
//!   argument vector and the same flag, pointing at the SHIPPING doctrine — so the two cells
//!   differ in exactly one thing, the contents of the file, and a reply that changes with it
//!   is a reply that read it. A negative test that passes for the wrong reason is not a test.
//! - **When it cannot run it refuses in words rather than reporting green.** No `claude`, no
//!   login, no network → a panic that says nothing was verified. A check that did not happen
//!   must not report `ok`.
//!
//! # What it does NOT prove
//!
//! That the model will FOLLOW the shipping doctrine's judgment clauses. It proves the channel
//! delivers, and that the delivered text steers the reply. Whether "never put machinery in
//! front of him" is honored on a given turn is a preference, not an enforcement, and the
//! design says so in as many words (§6.2). Claiming otherwise would be the kind of guarantee
//! this project refuses to make.
