//! THE TYPED TIMELINE — scope containment, the shared sequence, the visibility gate, and
//! restart.
//!
//! Slice 2 of the Codex-inspired conversation UX brief §24: *"core: add typed timeline and
//! worker lifecycle events"*. These tests pin the four properties the brief makes
//! load-bearing and one it forbids:
//!
//!   - **no machinery from one entity may ever render in another entity's thread** (§22
//!     "must not be faked: cross-entity context", §25 Integrity) — a negative control with
//!     a positive probe, in the same shape as
//!     `entity_binding_tests::no_event_from_one_entity_renders_in_another_entitys_thread`;
//!   - **one shared per-turn sequence** across assistant text, machinery AND the new
//!     timeline records (techy-mode §1.4 G1) — dense, unique, no second counter, live and
//!     after a restart;
//!   - **visibility is a gate**: no internal item and no raw command can reach a CEO view;
//!   - **restart neither loses nor invents** (§23 Phase 1 exit gate);
//!   - **no worker is ever invented** (§22) — including from the one tool call a worker
//!     could plausibly be inferred from.
