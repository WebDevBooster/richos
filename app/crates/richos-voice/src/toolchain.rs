//! Which binary and which weights are about to hear the CEO — checked before the mic opens.
//!
//! # Why this is here and not only in the service
//!
//! The whisper settings decision table's §7 is titled "The second consumer nobody had audited",
//! and this crate is that consumer: `stt.rs` shells out to the same `whisper-cli` the call
//! pipeline does, and until 2026-09-10 it ran at whisper.cpp's own `-mc -1` — the identical
//! unexamined default that filled 7.8% of a 92-minute channel with one fabricated sentence.
//! That got fixed. This closes the layer underneath it, which the table's §4 named and left open:
//! **the settings are now deliberate, and the binary they are handed to can change with no trace.**
//!
//! A settings table is a set of claims about ONE build. `-fa` is the worked example — flash
//! attention is whisper.cpp's default, `decode_args` pins it explicitly because it is worth 1.57
//! WER points, and that protection is worth exactly as much as knowing which binary received it.
//!
//! # ONE registry and ONE lock, shared with the Node service
//!
//! The model pins are `tools/richos-service/lib/model-pins.json`, compiled in with `include_str!`
//! rather than re-typed here. Two registries of truth is how the second unpinned consumer came to
//! exist in the first place, and a table this crate copied would be a table free to drift.
//!
//! The trust-on-first-use lock is the SAME file the service writes,
//! `~/.config/richos/whisper-toolchain.lock.json` (`RICHOS_TOOLCHAIN_LOCK` overrides). That is not
//! merely tidy: the two consumers share the model-hash cache, so once the call pipeline has hashed
//! `ggml-small.en.bin` the voice path gets its verification for free, and a binary this machine
//! has never seen is noticed whichever surface meets it first.
//!
//! # Refuse versus warn, and why they differ
//!
//! Identical to the service's, because a rule that changes by surface is a rule nobody can state:
//!
//! - **Weights that are not the pinned weights: REFUSE.** The pin table has authority — upstream
//!   plus a witness on disk — and the fetch path already refuses on the same hash.
//! - **A binary or backend that is not the one this machine locked: WARN, naming both identities.**
//!   The lock records what WAS, not what is right, and a `brew upgrade` must not silently take
//!   the CEO's voice mode away.
//!
//! `RICHOS_WHISPER_STRICT_TOOLCHAIN=1` escalates every warning to a refusal.
//!
//! # Cost, measured rather than assumed
//!
//! A conversational utterance decodes in 0.47–0.74 s (`stt.rs`), so nothing on this path may cost
//! a second. Measured on this M4 with `shasum -a 256`, three runs each: the 654,720-byte
//! `whisper-cli` hashes in 0.01 s and the 487,614,201-byte `ggml-small.en.bin` in 0.93–0.95 s.
//! So the binary is hashed every time and the model is hashed only when the
//! (path, size, mtime, inode) tuple says it moved — and this all happens ONCE, in
//! `Recognizer::resolve()` at voice-mode start, never per utterance. A missing model is already a
//! calm message at the toggle rather than a failure mid-sentence; so is a substituted one.
