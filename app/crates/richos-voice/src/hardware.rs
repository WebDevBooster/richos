//! Which model this machine can actually carry — asked, not assumed.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! Until 2026-09-10 `stt.rs:42` read `pub const DEFAULT_MODEL_ID: &str = "small.en";` — a
//! compile-time constant, identical on every machine, overridable only by an environment variable
//! a non-technical CEO will never set, and pinned there by a test that asserted the string. A
//! repo-wide grep for `sysctl`, `hw.memsize`, `total_memory` or `sysinfo` across `app/crates`
//! returned nothing: **the app never asked the machine anything.** The CEO put it as
//! *"WHY IS THE SHITTIEST POSSIBLE HARDWARE HARDCODED INTO THE APP???"*
//!
//! # What it turned out to be, which is not what anyone expected
//!
//! Physical RAM is the obvious input and it is the wrong one. Measured at utterance length on the
//! CEO's own M4 (`docs/measurements/hardware-model-resolution-2026-09-10/`):
//!
//! | model | peak RSS | one utterance |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `tiny.en` | 248,545,280 B | 0.202 s |
//! | `base.en` | 367,149,056 B | 0.248 s |
//! | `small.en` | **867,516,416 B** | 0.512 s |
//! | `large-v3-turbo-q5_0` | **858,570,752 B** | 1.302 s |
//! | `large-v3-turbo` | 1,989,836,800 B | 1.522 s |
//!
//! **`q5_0` costs 8,945,664 B LESS memory than `small.en`** — the quantized turbo is cheaper
//! resident than the model `config.js`'s tier table calls the fallback for *"low-RAM hosts"*.
//! `small.en` is fp16 and `q5_0` is 5-bit quantized; the turbo is larger on DISK (574,041,195 B
//! against 487,614,201 B) and that is the figure the constant was defended with. Disk size is not
//! memory size. Every model on that ladder, largest included, fits several times over in what a
//! working 24 GB Mac has spare (5,873,516,544 B measured under heavy load), so **memory does not
//! discriminate between these models on any Mac Apple ships.**
//!
//! Decode TIME does: 0.202 s to 2.108 s, a 10.4x span, and it is the axis that varies across
//! machines. So this module gates on measured time and keeps memory as a guard that should never
//! fire.
//!
//! # The two candidates that were measured and thrown away
//!
//! Both are the obvious thing to reach for and both are disqualified by
//! `measurements/machine-state.txt` rather than by opinion:
//!
//! - **`kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level` reads WARN on the CEO's machine in all six samples**
//!   during ordinary work. Not a spike — the steady state, on 24 GB with 5.8 GB spare. A resolver
//!   that demoted on elevated pressure would demote him permanently and would have looked
//!   completely principled in review. It is read here for the record and it decides nothing.
//! - **Available memory swung 315,375,616 B across six samples in six seconds** — a third of the
//!   entire ladder's memory span. Resolution keyed to it would depend on the second voice mode
//!   started, and the model id is written into every transcript's provenance line, so two
//!   transcripts from one machine on one afternoon would stop being comparable. It is kept as a
//!   guard only, where both sides of the comparison are measured bytes and no constant is chosen.
//!
//! # The ceiling is the record's, not this module's
//!
//! `stt.rs`'s module docs are the only place in either repository that says what a spoken
//! conversation may cost: *"a second of dead air after every sentence is the difference between
//! talking to Rich and operating him"*, against a promise of *"~0.5 s"*. So the ceiling is
//! **1.000 s** and the target is 0.5 s, both quoted rather than invented, both carried in
//! `model-costs.json` beside the figure they gate.
//!
//! # What this means for the live path, stated plainly
//!
//! **On every Mac measured today the live ladder can only step DOWN from `small.en`.** `q5_0`
//! medians 1.549 s busy and 1.331 s quiet on the CEO's M4 — 55% and 33% over the ceiling — and
//! his M4 is the fastest machine in play, so no slower machine makes it cheaper. The honest live
//! rule is therefore not "give the good machine the better model"; it is **"stop giving a slow
//! machine a model it cannot decode in time."** An M1 Air at 2x this cost would sit near 1.6 s per
//! utterance and the conversation would be unusable — and today it gets `small.en` regardless,
//! because a constant does not know what machine it is on.
//!
//! `q5_0` stays at the TOP of the live ladder anyway. The door opens by itself, with no code
//! change and no env var, on the first machine that decodes it under the ceiling. Recording that
//! no such machine exists yet is better than pretending the ladder has a rung it can reach.
//!
//! # The env override survives and stops being the only control
//!
//! `RICHOS_VOICE_WHISPER_MODEL_ID` still wins outright — engineers need it and reproducing a
//! measurement needs it. What changes is that someone who will never set one now gets an answer
//! read off their own machine instead of a hand-picked constant.
