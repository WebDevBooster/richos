//! Voice-mode events for the UI — the same shape as the spine's streaming contract.
//!
//! `app/crates/richos-core/src/stream.rs` established the pattern (`rich://` names as
//! constants, camelCase JSON payloads, a `TurnObserver` sink so the crate stays UI-agnostic).
//! Voice follows it exactly rather than inventing a second convention, so the Tauri shell
//! relays both the same way and the webview learns one idiom.
//!
//! | event | when | payload |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `rich://voice-state` | the mic state changed, a new input level is available, or the input went silent/came back | `{ state, level, bargeInArmed, noAudio, at }` |
//! | `rich://voice-transcript` | an utterance was recognized and submitted as a turn | `{ text, durationMs, latencyMs, at }` |
//! | `rich://voice-error` | voice mode could not start or had to stop | `{ message, at }` |
//! | `rich://voice-notice` | voice mode is working, but not the way it would on a better machine | `{ message, at }` |
//!
//! `message` on `voice-error` AND on `voice-notice` is ALWAYS a calm, Rich-voiced line. Device
//! names, exit codes and file paths go to stderr, never to the CEO (clean output).
//!
//! **`voice-notice` is NOT a quieter `voice-error`, and the split is the point.** An error says
//! voice stopped; a notice says voice is running and has quietly made a choice on the CEO's
//! behalf — today, that his machine could not carry the more accurate recognizer. Sending that
//! down `voice-error` would put a failure face on a working feature; suppressing it would be the
//! defect `hardware.rs` exists to remove, which is a product that silently gives a good machine
//! the weak model and never says so. It is the product explaining itself.
