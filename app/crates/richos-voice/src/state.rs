//! The voice-mode state machine — what the CEO is told the microphone is doing.
//!
//! The UX direction §4.1 is unambiguous about why this matters: with no echo cancellation shipping in
//! v1, *"the CEO always knows whether the mic is hot — this is the single most important
//! voice-UX requirement."* So mic state is not a cosmetic label derived from whatever the
//! audio threads happen to be doing; it is an explicit machine with tested transitions.
//!
//! Four facts drive it, and they are genuinely independent:
//!
//! | fact | set by |
//! |---|---|
//! | voice mode is on | the CEO's `◉` toggle |
//! | a CEO utterance is in flight | the endpointer |
//! | a spine turn is in flight | `rich://turn-started` / terminal event |
//! | Rich has audio playing out | the playout queue |
//!
//! [`VoiceState`] is a VIEW over those four, in priority order, so the panel can never show
//! two things at once and can never flicker between them mid-sentence:
//!
//! ```text
//!   off?         -> Off
//!   speaking?    -> Speaking     (wins: a pause between Rich's sentences is still "speaking")
//!   hearing?     -> Hearing      (the CEO is mid-utterance)
//!   turn active? -> Thinking     (Rich has it, hasn't opened his mouth yet)
//!   otherwise    -> Listening
//! ```

/// What the CEO is shown. The UI renders `Listening` and `Speaking` as the two unmistakable
/// states of the UX direction §4.1 sketch; `Hearing` is Listening with the level meter live, and
/// `Thinking` reuses the existing "Rich is working" affordance.
