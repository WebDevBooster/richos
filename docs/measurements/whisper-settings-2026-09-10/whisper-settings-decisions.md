# Whisper decode settings — the decision table

**Every setting the transcription pipeline hands to `whisper-cli`, and every setting it leaves
unset, decided deliberately.** One row per flag: what the vendor does, what we ship, and the
measurement or argument that makes ours the better one.

**The rule this answers,** CEO, 2026-09-10:

> "NEVER use the **default** settings of ANY third-party tool/software for ANYTHING. UNLESS the
> default settings have proven the be the best possible settings."

So a row whose reason is "this is the default" is acceptable **only** where the comparison that
proves it is on disk. Every such row below cites the run.

- The rig, the corpora and their limits: [`README.md`](README.md)
- The runs: [`measurements/`](measurements/) — `shortcall-sweep.txt`, `longform.txt`,
  `name-hits.txt`, `identical-to-baseline.txt`, `dictation-probe.txt`, `rig-validation.txt`
- The real command lines: `measurements/raw/*/*.argv*.json`, recorded by the shim from the process
  that ran, never transcribed from source

**Vendor build every "vendor default" column refers to:** whisper.cpp **1.9.1**, ggml **0.17.0**,
Apple M4. Defaults are a property of a build, not of a product — §6 is about that.

## How to read the evidence column

| Token | Means |
|---|---|
| **MEASURED** | a run in `measurements/` here, today, against the alternative |
| **MEASURED (record)** | a run in the earlier briefs, cited by file; re-derived here where the conclusion leans on it |
| **ARGUED** | no measurement decides it — the reason is structural (the flag would break a contract, or its input does not exist). Stated as an argument, never dressed as a result. |

**The baseline every short-call figure is compared to is the shipping configuration**, which scores
**WER 2.89%** (S40 D7 I8 over 1,905 reference tokens, 152 segments, 76 s) on the 6-call corpus.
Twelve configurations produce output **byte-identical** to it (sha256 `b8de7bb389f5…`); that is the
strong form of "changed nothing" and `identical-to-baseline.txt` is where it is checked.

## 1. What the pipeline passes today

Captured from a full `richos-service run`, not read out of `config.js`:

```
-m <model> -f <wav> -l en -t 4 -mc 0 -oj -np -ojf -of <base>
```

and the deletion detector's clip probe, same decode flags, no `-ojf`/`-of`, several files at once:

```
-m <model> -l en -t 4 -mc 0 -oj -np <clip0> <clip1>
```

plus one `--version` per session from `whisperVersion()` — the identity probe, §4.1.

| Flag | Vendor default | We ship | Why ours, with evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-m` | `models/ggml-base.en.bin` | resolved model path | **ARGUED.** The vendor default names a file that does not exist on this machine. `resolveModelChecked()` picks by id and refuses a candidate failing size/GGML-magic against its pin. |
| `-f` | none | the channel WAV | **ARGUED.** One decode per channel is what makes every segment speaker-attributed before the merge, with no diarization model. |
| `-l en` | `en` (same value) | `en`, explicitly | **MEASURED.** `-l auto` is byte-identical on this corpus and **20% slower** (91 s vs 76 s): the detect pass is pure cost on known-English audio. Pinned rather than inherited because `auto` is one upstream edit away from being the default, and a mis-detected language changes every word. |
| `-t 4` | `4` (same value) | `4`, explicitly | **MEASURED.** `-t 8` is byte-identical **and the same wall clock** (76 s both) — the decode is Metal-bound, so threads past 4 buy nothing. Pinned so the value does not follow the vendor's idea of this machine. |
| `-mc 0` | `-1` (carry everything) | `0` | **MEASURED, re-derived today on the 92-minute real recording.** `-mc 0`: 0 loop findings, 0.0 s, 2 silence fabrications, 226 s. `-mc -1`: 9 findings, **429.8 s = 7.8% of the timeline**, 130 silence fabrications, 509 s — including one sentence repeated **203 times** across 290 s. The 2,008 extra words `-mc -1` emits are not recovered speech: the guard removes 1,493 of them. On short calls the two are within noise today (2.78% vs 2.89%), so this costs nothing at call length and prevents everything at conference length. §5 holds what it does cost. |
| `-oj` | off | on | **ARGUED.** The merge needs per-segment timestamps; the plain text output has none. |
| `-ojf` | off | on | **MEASURED (record).** Adds per-token offsets and nothing else — proven byte-identical on the 92-minute corpus (`transcribe.js:117-122`). The deletion detector localizes on word times; scored on segment extents instead it invents deletions (8 of 9 detected vs 6 of 9). |
| `-np` | off | on | **ARGUED.** Progress prints on stdout would corrupt the log; the transcript is read from the JSON file, never from stdout. |
| `-of` | none | the channel base path | **ARGUED.** Contract with the caller. Deliberately **not** passed on the multi-file clip probe, where one output base would make every clip overwrite the last. |
| `-fa` | `true` | **`true`, explicitly — NEW** | **MEASURED, and this is the row that proves the CEO's rule pays.** `-nfa` scores **4.46%** against the baseline's 2.89% (+1.57 points, S47 D9 I29 vs S40 D7 I8) and is **18% slower**; proper-noun hits fall 46 → 41 of 66. Flash attention is worth 1.57 WER points, so it is far too valuable to hold by inheritance: passing it explicitly is byte-identical today and cannot silently flip when the vendor changes its mind. |

## 2. Decode parameters we leave at the vendor value — each with the comparison on disk

| Flag | Vendor default | We ship | Why, with evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-bs` / `-bo` | `5` / `5` | `5` / `5` | **MEASURED both directions.** Greedy (`-bs 1 -bo 1`) is **4.09%** (+1.20 points) for 5% less wall clock; a wider beam (`-bs 8 -bo 8`) is **3.31%** (+0.42 points) for **33% more**. The vendor's 5 is a genuine optimum here, not an unexamined value. |
| `-p` | `1` | `1` | **MEASURED.** `-p 2` scores the same WER with a worse error profile (S37 D9 I9, cased 4.30% vs 3.94%) and is 5% slower. Splitting one file across processors also breaks it at fixed boundaries, which is the failure mode the vendor's own documentation warns about. |
| `-ac` | `0` (full) | `0` | **MEASURED.** `-ac 1500` is byte-identical and **8% slower**. Nothing to gain, so the full audio context stays. |
| `-wt` | `0.01` | `0.01` | **MEASURED.** `-wt 0.5` — a 50x move — is byte-identical, and the token-offset count the deletion detector consumes is unchanged (1,829 both). Inert on this material in this build. |
| `-nth` | `0.60` | `0.60` | **MEASURED here and in the record.** `-nth 0.9` is byte-identical. The record's six-way sweep (`0.01 … 0.9`) on a real host channel holding 14 segments over measured silence produced six byte-identical JSON files (`config.js:190-200`). Inert across a 90x range. |
| `-et` | `2.40` | `2.40` | **MEASURED (record).** Passing it explicitly at its default value produced byte-identical JSON on the 92-minute corpus (`config.js:180-186`); it was removed from the `max` tier for implying a defense that was never running. |
| `-lpt` | `-1.00` | `-1.00` | **MEASURED (record).** `-lpt 0.0` removed one of 14 silence segments for **+90% wall clock** and perturbed the real decode (+1 segment, +8 words). A cost with no defensible benefit. |
| `-tp` / `-tpi` / `-nf` | `0.00` / `0.20` / off | unchanged | **MEASURED, and the chain matters.** `-nf` (fallback off entirely) is **byte-identical** to the baseline, which proves temperature fallback never fires on this material — so temperature and its increment are provably inert here, and no material exists on which to tune them. Leaving fallback ENABLED is the deliberate half: it is the vendor's recovery path for audio harder than anything we can measure, and turning it off would remove a defense to buy nothing. |
| `-ml` / `-sow` | `0` / off | `0` / off | **MEASURED.** `-ml 60 -sow` produces byte-identical TEXT with 250 segments instead of 152 and costs 7% more time. Finer segments would change caption and merge granularity for no accuracy gain, so the segment boundaries stay the model's. |
| `-dtw` | off | off | **MEASURED.** `-dtw large.v3.turbo` is byte-identical **including the token offsets we consume** (1,829 word times either way) and costs **26% more wall clock**. It writes its timestamps somewhere `parseSegmentWordTimes` does not read; enabling it would be paying for an unused output. |
| `-sns` | off | off | **MEASURED.** `-sns` scores **3.41%** (+0.52 points, insertions 8 → 16). Suppressing non-speech tokens makes this pipeline worse, not safer. |
| `--prompt` / `--carry-initial-prompt` | unset / off | **unset, and §5 is why** | **MEASURED.** Under `-mc 0` both are **byte-identical to no prompt at all** — a zero text-context budget leaves no room for the prompt tokens — while costing 29–55% wall clock. Setting them today would ship a feature that reports on and does nothing. |
| `--suppress-regex` | unset | unset | **ARGUED.** A regex that deletes text before anything looks at the audio is the failure this project has already recorded: the captured fabricated span contains a real spoken "Zero.", so a blanket strip deletes speech (`ceo-decisions.md` §10). Suppression here is post-decode, adjudicated against the audio, and stays there. |
| `--grammar` / `--grammar-rule` / `--grammar-penalty` | unset / unset / `100.0` | unset | **ARGUED.** A GBNF grammar constrains the decoder to a formal language. Conversation is not one. Nothing to write. |
| `-ot` / `-on` / `-d` | `0` / `0` / `0` | unchanged | **ARGUED.** Offsets and durations are for decoding part of a file. We decode the whole channel; the clip probe cuts its own audio with ffmpeg so that every stage measures the same clip the same way. |
| `-ng` / `-dev` | off / `0` | unchanged | **ARGUED.** Disabling the GPU on an Apple-Silicon host would multiply decode time for nothing. One GPU, device 0. |
| `-oved` | `CPU` | unset | **ARGUED.** OpenVINO is not in this build and not on this platform. |
| `-tr` | off | off | **ARGUED.** Translation would replace an English transcript with an English translation of it — a different artifact, silently. |
| `-di` / `-tdrz` | off / off | off | **ARGUED.** Speakers are separated by CAPTURE, one channel each, before any model sees them. `-di` needs stereo we do not feed it; `-tdrz` needs a tinydiarize model we do not ship. Both would add a second, weaker opinion about a fact we already know. |
| `-dl` | off | off | **ARGUED.** It exits after detecting the language and produces no transcript. |
| `-debug` / `-ls` | off / off | off | **ARGUED.** Diagnostics that put non-transcript material on the output paths. |
| `-ps` / `-pc` / `-pp` / `--print-confidence` / `-nt` | all off | all off | **ARGUED.** Console presentation. We read the JSON file. (`-nt` IS used by the dictation path, §7, which reads stdout on purpose.) |
| `-otxt` / `-ovtt` / `-osrt` / `-olrc` / `-ocsv` / `-owts` / `-fp` | all off | all off | **ARGUED.** Alternative output formats and the karaoke font. `-oj`/`-ojf` is the one the merge parses; the others would be unread files in the session directory. |
| `-h` / `--version` | — | **`--version` once per session — CHANGED 2026-09-10** | **MEASURED.** It probed `--help` and returned a constant. It now probes `--version`, whose stdout carries the build (`whisper.cpp version: 1.9.1`) and whose stderr carries the `load_backend:` lines naming every ggml backend loaded — one 0.04 s invocation for both, out of the decode path. The "worth revisiting" note this row used to carry is now done; §4.1 holds the measurement that made it harder than it looked, because **1.8.3 rejects `--version` and exits 0 with empty stdout.** |

## 3. Voice Activity Detection — the default nobody had justified, now justified

`--vad` is off. It was off because nobody had turned it on. It is off now because it was measured
three ways.

| Configuration | Short-call WER | Deletions | Wall (short) | Wall (92 min real) | Silence fabrications (92 min) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| VAD off (ships) | **2.89%** | 7 | 76 s | **226 s** | 2 |
| `--vad`, vendor sub-defaults | 4.67% | **31** | 59 s | — | — |
| `--vad`, tuned (`-vt 0.3 -vp 200 -vsd 500 -vspd 100`) | **2.68%** | 8 | 65 s | **431 s** | **0** |

Three findings, and the third is the decision:

1. **The vendor's VAD sub-defaults clip speech.** Deletions go 7 → 31. `Brightmoor Dental` goes from
   3 of 4 exact to **0 of 4** — the name is inside the audio the segmenter trimmed. Shipping `--vad`
   on its own defaults would have been the same mistake as `-mc -1`, in the other direction.
2. **Tuned, VAD is the best short-call score measured** (2.68%) and 14% faster.
3. **On the real 92 minutes the same tuned VAD is 91% SLOWER** (431 s vs 226 s) for ten words of
   difference. The synthetic speed-up is an artifact of the corpus: `build-corpus.mjs` fills the
   non-speaking channel with `anullsrc` — **exact digital silence** — which Silero skips instantly.
   Real captured audio is never digitally silent; VAD there fragments continuous speech into many
   small decode windows, each paying encoder cost.

**Decision: `--vad` stays off, and its seven sub-flags (`-vm`, `-vt`, `-vspd`, `-vsd`, `-vmsd`,
`-vp`, `-vo`) stay unset** — they are inert while it is off. Enabling it would also mean bundling,
pinning and integrity-checking an eighth model file (`ggml-silero-v5.1.2.bin`, 885,098 B, sha256
`29940d98d42b91fbd05ce489f3ecf7c72f0a42f027e4875919a28fb4c04ea2cf`), which is not on this machine by
default and had to be fetched from `huggingface.co/ggml-org/whisper-vad` to run these rows at all.

**What it costs us, stated rather than buried:** tuned VAD is the only configuration measured that
removes the silence-fabrication class *at the decode stage* (2 → 0 on the real channel). We keep
handling that class post-decode, in `repetition-guard.js` class 4, against the physical audio.

**The condition under which this answer flips, and why nobody should act on it yet:** a channel that
is mostly true silence is where VAD wins, and a real two-party call capture — where `me` is silent
while the other person talks — is exactly that shape. The only long real audio in existence here is
a webinar where the host talks continuously, and per the CEO's ruling of 2026-09-10 there will never
be another recording to settle it on. So this is named, priced and **deliberately not built**: a
per-channel silence-share switch would be tuning on material we do not have.

## 4. Not flags, but settings all the same — and these are the unguarded ones

| Setting | Today | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| `whisper-cli` build | **PINNED per machine, 2026-09-10.** Homebrew's linked `whisper-cpp`, 1.9.1 today, 1.8.3 also on disk | **Was the largest remaining exposure in the table; now closed.** Every default in the "vendor default" column is a property of 1.9.1, and `-fa` alone is worth 1.57 WER points while being a *default*. The binary's sha256 is recorded on first use in a machine lock and re-hashed on **every** run (654,720 B, 0.01 s — free), so a changed build produces a loud warning naming both identities rather than a silent accuracy change. Not a source pin, and §4.1 is why. |
| ggml backend | **PINNED per machine, 2026-09-10.** 0.17.0, separate formula | Same mechanism. The backends are read off the binary's own `load_backend:` startup lines — measured, not guessed from a Cellar path — and hashed with it, so a ggml formula bump is caught with `whisper-cpp` untouched. |
| `whisperVersion()` | **records the run, 2026-09-10.** | It returned the constant string `'whisper.cpp (whisper-cli)'` on every run ever made, so it could never disagree with itself. It now returns e.g. `whisper.cpp 1.9.1 bin:7dc20e3106d7 [BLAS/MTL/CPU] model:large-v3-turbo@1fc70f774d38`, and `session.json` carries the full hashes **per run**, so a re-transcription cannot re-attribute an earlier one. |
| model files | pinned by size + sha256 in `model-pins.json`, verified on fetch, **and now hashed before every decode** (cached on identity) | The pattern the rows above were missing, and it is now enforced at the decode too: `resolveModel` on the hot path never looked at the hash at all. |
| `RICHOS_WHISPER_*` env overrides | `RICHOS_WHISPER_MAX_CONTEXT`, `_LANG`, `_THREADS`, `_MODEL`, `_BIN` | Deliberate escape hatches. Each one can silently restore a vendor default — `RICHOS_WHISPER_MAX_CONTEXT=-1` is `-mc -1` again — which is why `verification.json` records the EFFECTIVE `whisperArgs`, not the intended one. `_MODEL` and `_BIN` are now recorded by IDENTITY as well as by path. |

### 4.1 Why the binary is locked per machine and the weights are pinned in source

**Two tiers, deliberately unequal, and the asymmetry is the whole design.**

| | Where the expectation lives | On a mismatch | Why that one |
|---|---|---|---|
| **model weights** | `model-pins.json`, in source, six models | **REFUSE** | The table has authority: HuggingFace's `x-linked-etag` plus a shasum of the CEO's own copy say what the bytes are supposed to be. The fetch path already refuses on this exact hash, so a decode path that shrugged would be overruling it. |
| **`whisper-cli` + ggml backends** | `~/.config/richos/whisper-toolchain.lock.json`, written on first use | **WARN, naming both identities** | `whisper-cli` comes from Homebrew. No source sha256 could hold across arch, OS version and bottle revision, and a pin every other machine fails is a pin nobody keeps. The lock records what WAS there, not what is right — so a routine `brew upgrade` must not leave an already-captured call untranscribable. The CEO cannot re-record a meeting. |

`RICHOS_WHISPER_STRICT_TOOLCHAIN=1` escalates every warning to a refusal — for reproducing the
measurements in this table, where "the binary changed" invalidates the run. **Off by default, and
the default is a decision:** on by default would mean a Homebrew upgrade silently stops
transcription for someone who has no idea what a bottle is.

**The reference build lives in `model-pins.json` too**, in a `toolchain` block beside the six model
pins, because two registries of truth is how the second unpinned consumer came to exist. It is what
a run is compared and attributed to, never a requirement a second machine would fail.

**And the version string is a LABEL, not the identity — measured, not assumed:**

```
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/whisper-cpp/1.9.1/bin/whisper-cli --version
  exit 0, stdout: whisper.cpp version: 1.9.1
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/whisper-cpp/1.8.3/bin/whisper-cli --version
  exit 0, stdout: EMPTY (0 bytes), stderr: error: unknown argument: --version
```

**1.8.3 rejects the flag and still exits ZERO.** A probe that trusted the exit code would see
success and an empty version — indistinguishable from a build that simply has none. So the sha256
is the identity, the exit status is recorded and never consulted, and a build that will not
identify itself gets a finding of its own rather than an empty field nobody reads. That also
supersedes the "worth revisiting" note in §2's `-h` / `--version` row: `--version` IS now the probe,
and this is the trap it had to be written around.

**What is hashed when**, measured on this M4 with `shasum -a 256`, three runs each:

| | Size | Time | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| `whisper-cli` | 654,720 B | 0.01 / 0.01 / 0.01 s | **every run** |
| ggml backends (×3) | ~1.5 MB | under 0.05 s | **every run** |
| `ggml-small.en.bin` | 487,614,201 B | 0.95 / 0.93 / 0.93 s | cache miss only |
| `ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin` | 1,624,555,275 B | 3.13 / 3.11 s | cache miss only |

The binary is free to hash and is precisely the thing a package manager swaps under you, so it is
hashed every time. A dictation utterance decodes in 0.47–0.74 s (§7), so a 0.93 s hash on each one
would nearly triple that path's latency; models are cached on (path, size, mtime, inode, device).
**The limit of that cache, stated rather than buried:** a rewrite in place restoring all five fields
would be believed until something re-hashes. `richos-service toolchain --recheck` and
`verify-model` are that something, and a refused run never writes the cache.

**Both consumers, one lock.** `tools/richos-service` and `app/crates/richos-voice` share the same
lock file and the same pin table (compiled in with `include_str!`), so a changed binary is caught by
whichever surface meets it first and a model hashed by one is verified for the other.

**Inspect it:** `richos-service toolchain` (`--recheck` re-hashes, `--relock` accepts a change on
purpose), or `cargo run -p richos-voice --example toolchain_probe`.

## 5. What `-mc 0` costs, priced rather than asserted

The invariant is right and the ledger is not free. Both halves, measured today:

| | `-mc 0` (ships) | `-mc 64` | `-mc 224` | `-mc -1` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| short-call WER | 2.89% | **2.73%** | 9.92% | 2.78% |
| proper nouns exact (of 66) | 46 (69.70%) | **55 (83.33%)** | 55 (83.33%) | 49 (74.24%) |
| 92-minute fabricated share | **0.0%** | 3.3% | — | 7.8% |
| 92-minute wall | **226 s** | 393 s | — | 509 s |

The `-mc 64` column is with a carried initial prompt naming the entities; without a prompt the
budget does nothing for names. Read across: **the setting that fixes name spelling is the same
setting that reopens fabrication.** `--prompt` is not a third path around the invariant, which is
what this table set out to find out.

That prices open item **3.3d**, whose CEO decision is *"leave the invariant and canonicalize names in
loro-correction, or make decode context length-dependent"*: the second option now has a number
against it (3.3% of a 92-minute timeline at the cheapest budget that helps), and a third option that
looked available — bias with a prompt and keep `-mc 0` — is measured to do **nothing at all**.

**No default, tier or invariant is changed by this document**, except `-fa`, which is pinned at the
value it already had. The `-mc` decision remains the CEO's.

## 6. What the earlier record this supersedes, and what it does not

| Earlier finding | Status after today |
|---|---|
| `-mc 0` over `-mc -1` (`ceo-decisions.md` §10) | **CONFIRMED**, re-derived on today's build against the same recording: 0.0% vs 7.8% of the timeline, 203 fabricated repeats reproduced. |
| Short-call WER 4.15% at `-mc 0`, 10.34% at `-mc -1` (row 3.3d) | **NOT REPRODUCIBLE as absolute numbers.** The same configuration scores 2.89% today; `say` has drifted (call-01 is 47.10 s against the committed 47.08 s). Re-scoring the committed August transcripts reproduces all four figures exactly, so the rig is sound and the AUDIO is what changed. The *direction* is also no longer visible at short call length today (2.78% vs 2.89%, inside noise), which is why the invariant's justification here rests on the long-form measurement rather than on that corpus. |
| "The fix costs name spelling" (row 3.3d) | **CONFIRMED and extended.** 46 of 66 at `-mc 0` against 49 at `-mc -1`, and 55 with a prompt at `-mc 64`. Extension: the prompt lever is unavailable at `-mc 0`. |
| `-et` / `-lpt` / `-nth` inert (`config.js:180-200`) | **CONFIRMED** on this corpus for `-nth`; the record's own byte-identical runs stand for the others. |
| Deletion detection at `-mc 0` = 2.2 s (row 3.3f) | **Untouched.** Nothing here changes a decode setting that feeds it. |
| Model choice, turbo vs q5_0 (§10 / item 1.3) | **NOT DECIDED HERE, and not mine.** Nothing in this table is model-specific by construction: every row was measured on `large-v3-turbo` and every conclusion is about the decoder's behavior, not the weights. The one row that could plausibly differ between a full and a quantized model is `-fa`, since flash attention interacts with numeric precision; if the CEO moves the default to q5_0, re-run the `nofa` row and nothing else. |

## 7. The second consumer nobody had audited

`app/crates/richos-voice/src/stt.rs` also shells out to `whisper-cli` — the dictation and
conversational path — and it was running `-l en -t 4 -np -nt` and **nothing else**, so its decode
context was at the vendor's `-mc -1`: the identical unexamined default that started all of this,
still live in a second place. It also offers `RICHOS_WHISPER_PROMPT` as the loro entity-biasing seam.

Measured on one 6-second utterance through `small.en`, three runs each
(`measurements/dictation-probe.txt`):

| Configuration | Result | Latency |
|---|---|---|
| `-mc -1` (what it shipped) | "Halda**n** Freight" | 587–661 ms |
| `-mc 0` | "Halda**n** Freight" | 612–641 ms |
| `-mc 0` + prompt | "Halda**n** Freight" — **the prompt does nothing** | 609–614 ms |
| `-mc 64` + prompt | "Halde**n** Freight" — correct | 607–654 ms |

So the path now passes `-fa` and an explicit `-mc`: **0 when no prompt is configured** (the
invariant, no measurable cost at utterance length), and **64 when one is** — because at 0 the
configured prompt is silently inert, and a seam that reports on while doing nothing is the defect
class this codebase already refuses elsewhere. Latency is unchanged either way, inside run-to-run
noise.

**The bound, stated:** 64 carried tokens is a fabrication risk on audio long enough to accumulate
them (3.3% of a 92-minute timeline). It is taken only when a prompt is set, and dictation utterances
are seconds long. Anyone wiring a long recording through the voice path should read §5 first.

## 8. What remains undecidable, and the honest fallback in each case

There will be no more recordings. These do not resolve later; they are answered now, conservatively,
or they are named as not answerable.

| Question | Why it cannot be settled | What we do instead |

| Does `-mc 0` DELETE real speech on long audio? | After the guard removes fabrication, `-mc -1` still has 515 more words over 92 minutes and no reference exists to say whose they are. | Ship `-mc 0` — the configuration that provably does not destroy 7.8% of a timeline — and leave the deletion and substitution detectors running, which is where under-transcription is caught with evidence rather than guessed at. |
| Is `--vad` right for a real two-party CALL capture? | The only long real audio is a continuously-talking webinar; a call's silent channel is the shape where VAD wins, and no such recording exists. | Keep VAD off (never deletes speech, bundles no extra model). The condition is recorded in §3 and deliberately not built. |
| Are `-tp` / `-tpi` / `-et` / `-lpt` tuned right for hard audio? | Fallback never fires on any material we have, so every value is inert on it. | Keep the vendor's recovery path enabled and unmodified. Tuning a defense on material that never triggers it would be fitting to noise. |
| Would a different `-wt` improve deletion-detector localization? | Two settings 50x apart give identical token offsets on this corpus; nothing here exercises it. | Leave at `0.01` and keep scoring coverage on word times, which is already the measured-better unit. |
| turbo vs q5_0 | The CEO's, and out of scope for this table. | Nothing here depends on it; see §6. |
