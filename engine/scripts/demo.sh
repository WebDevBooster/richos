# demo.sh — the 60-second proof-of-life. One command, unattended, that shows
# a CEO the engine's enforcement machinery actually working, before they trust
# it with a real repo.
#
# WHAT THIS IS: value-roadmap.md §B2 ("test-drive mode") plus the missing
# "one-command demo button" Frank's hostile-buyer review flagged as the
# single highest-leverage gap ("B2 is the content; this is the button").
# Frank's minimum proof-of-life spec (his review, "#1 build priority"):
# watch (a) the isolation guard block a bad spawn, (b) an engineer commit on
# a worktree branch, (c) a QA agent reject a planted defect, (d) the fix
# pass, (e) the lander merge to main. This script drives exactly that loop,
# unattended, against a throwaway sample repo — then tears the sample down.
#
# DESIGN DECISION — sample project is synthesized at runtime, not shipped:
# the "sample company repo" this script drives is built fresh in a temp dir
# on every run (git init, hooks copied in, a two-file toy product written out)
# rather than a persistent `demo/sample-project/` checked into the engine. This
# keeps the engine tree free of orphan demo data to maintain, guarantees the
# demo can never drift out of sync with the current hooks (it always copies
# THIS commit's hook files), and makes "re-runnable" and "engine repo untouched"
# trivially true by construction — there is nothing in the engine for the demo
# to touch in the first place.
#
# HONEST LABELING (Frank's truth-in-labeling lesson applies to the demo
# itself): every beat below is marked either
#   [REAL ENFORCEMENT]      — the actual hook binary / real git mechanics run,
#                             unmodified, and its real exit code decides
#                             pass/fail.
#   [NARRATED SIMULATION]   — there is no live LLM agent here (this script is
#                             plain bash), so the QA-verdict beat is narrated:
#                             the git/commit mechanics and the QA check script
#                             it runs are REAL and its exit code is real, but
#                             the "QA agent's judgment" is this demo's own
#                             scripted stand-in, not a spawned teammate. Said
#                             explicitly, every time, never presented as a
#                             live agent transcript.
#
# PREREQUISITES (same as the engine's own, nothing extra): bash, git, python3,
# standard coreutils. No Claude API key. No live agents. No network access.
# Deterministic and unattended — safe for a buyer to run sight-unseen.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/demo.sh
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every beat passed — the enforcement machinery works end-to-end
#   1  unexpected error (missing prerequisite, setup failure)
#   2  one or more beats failed — the demo doubles as an integrity check
