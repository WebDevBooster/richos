# scripts/lib/registered-hooks.sh — THE GUARD INVENTORY, DERIVED FROM THE
#                                    REGISTRATION SURFACE.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
# ===========================================================================
# "How many guards are there?" was answered, in two different places, by a list
# a human had typed. It drifted twice in two days:
#
#   13/13  guard-workflow-ban.sh added, list not updated. Observed live in a
#          real ~/ab/prospects session. Fixed at d55f54b by making the banner's
#          numerator and denominator walk the SAME typed list — which removed
#          the arithmetic error and left the typing in place.
#   14/14  79d6958 / 084eed3 wired guard-worktree-removal.sh. The typed list was
#          not touched. Within hours of the previous fix, femcboost sessions at
#          engine 1.0.0 announced "14/14 guards" — a full, reassuring fraction
#          over a stale inventory — with 15 guards plus the announcer loaded.
#
# Both times the guard was present, executable, hash-matched and firing. The
# defect was never in the guard; it was that the count of guards was a SECOND,
# INDEPENDENT record of the same fact, maintained by memory. A list a human must
# remember to update is not a mitigation for drift, it is a source of it.
#
# So the count is no longer recorded anywhere. It is DERIVED, here, from
# hooks/hooks.json — the file that actually determines what the host loads.
# Nothing else can be the source: a script present on disk but never wired
# enforces nothing (and must not inflate a count), and a script wired but absent
# from disk enforces nothing either (and must show as a SHORTFALL, which is the
# whole signal the banner's fraction carries). Those are two different questions
# and this library answers only the first one — "what does the host load?".
# Callers answer the second themselves, against the disk.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY A SHARED LIBRARY RATHER THAN A SECOND PARSER
# ===========================================================================
# engine-status.sh needs this inventory to size its fraction, and
# contract-integrity-probe.sh needs it to check that the banner and the probe
# are looking at the same set. Two hand-rolled parsers of the same file is how
# the original defect was born, one level down. There is one parser, both use
# it, and the probe (BR2) additionally compares this library's answer against
# its OWN independent python3 parse of hooks.json — so a bug in here cannot
# quietly shrink the inventory for both readers at once.
#
# ===========================================================================
# NO SILENT DEGRADATION
# ===========================================================================
# The engine's governing rule is fail LOUD, never skip. A parser that returned
# "0 guards" or a partial list when it could not read the registration surface
# would hand its caller a number that looks like an answer, which is the exact
# failure this file exists to remove. So the contract is: either a complete
# inventory and rc 0, or NOTHING on stdout and a non-zero rc the caller must
# report rather than paper over.

# registered_hook_scripts <path-to-hooks.json> [event]
#
# Prints one hook-script BASENAME per line ("guard-bash-main-writes.sh"),
# sorted and de-duplicated — every script the given hook table registers, on
# any event, under any matcher. Inline hooks that run no script (the knowledge-
# verification echo) contribute nothing, correctly: they are not scripts and
# cannot be present-or-missing on disk.
#
# With [event] ("Stop", "PreToolUse", …) the answer is narrowed to the scripts
# that table registers ON THAT EVENT. The narrowed form exists so that "which
# hooks run at turn-end?" is DERIVED like every other inventory here rather than
# typed: stop-hook-visibility.test.sh asks this question, and a typed answer of
# 14 where the registration held 15 is the exact defect the whole file was
# written about. A Stop hook added tomorrow is in the answer with no edit here
# and no edit there.
#
# The event filter REQUIRES python3 and says so with rc 3 rather than degrading.
# The text-scan fallback below cannot see event boundaries at all, so filtering
# through it would silently return the WHOLE inventory under an event's name —
# an over-count wearing a precise label, which is worse than the honest refusal.
#
# Exit codes — a caller MUST distinguish these from an empty inventory:
#   0  complete inventory printed
#   1  no such file (the path is wrong, or the engine install is incomplete)
#   2  present but unparseable, or parseable and registering no script at all
#      (with [event]: no script registered on that event)
#   3  [event] was requested and python3 is unavailable — cannot filter
# ===========================================================================
# THE DISPATCHER IS EXPANDED INTO THE RULES IT RUNS
# ===========================================================================
# scripts/hooks/dispatch-pretooluse.sh is ONE registered command that runs N
# rule modules in one process, named in scripts/hooks/dispatch-pretooluse.manifest.
# Seventeen guards moved out of hooks/hooks.json and into that manifest on
# 2026-09-15.
#
# WHY THE INVENTORY MUST STILL NAME THEM. Every consumer of this library is
# asking a question about ENFORCEMENT, not about process count: is this guard
# present on disk, executable, hash-matched, carrying the root bootstrap,
# acknowledged by the suite that watches the registration for drift. A guard
# that runs as a dispatcher module is enforcing exactly as much as one that runs
# as its own process — and if the inventory stopped naming it, deleting its line
# from the manifest would turn enforcement off with NOTHING going red. That is
# the ratchet running backwards: the manifest would be a second, unwatched
# registration surface, which is the defect this whole library was written about
# (a typed list drifting twice in two days, 13/13 and 14/14 over stale
# inventories).
#
# So the answer to "what does the host load?" is: the dispatcher, AND every rule
# the manifest gives it. One derivation, in one place, and every consumer keeps
# the question it was already asking.
#
# _rh_dispatch_modules <hooks.json> [event]
#   Prints the rule-module basenames the dispatcher is registered to run, on the
#   given event or on any event. Prints NOTHING (rc 0) when the dispatcher is not
#   registered or the manifest is absent — the caller's own list is then the
#   whole answer, which is the pre-dispatcher behavior exactly.

# _rh_manifest_for <hooks.json> — the dispatcher manifest that governs this
# surface, or nothing. Same candidate order as the python path uses, for the
# same reason: the derived path is right for the shipped layout and wrong for

# table that names this engine's dispatcher without carrying a tree of its own.

#
# WHY A SECOND FUNCTION RATHER THAN A RICHER FIRST ONE
# ----------------------------------------------------
# registered_hook_scripts answers "which guards does the host load?", and its
# consumers — the session banner's fraction, install.sh's sidecar minting — want
# a flat set of filenames. The staleness pair (snapshot-enforcing-hooks.sh /
# notice-hook-staleness.sh) has to know WHERE each script is wired, because "the
# same guard newly wired onto a second event" is drift that a set of basenames
# cannot see. Widening the existing function would have meant editing three call
# sites to throw two thirds of the answer away. Both functions parse the same
# file, the same way, in the same place — which is the entire point of this
# file: one parser, not four.
#
# NO TEXT-SCAN FALLBACK, DELIBERATELY. registered_hook_scripts degrades to a
# grep when python3 is absent, and can afford to: over-counting a filename is
# survivable, and BR2 cross-checks it. This function cannot. A text scan cannot
# tell which event or matcher a command sits under — it would have to GUESS the
# association, and a guessed row is precisely the invented fact that would turn
# a staleness comparison into a false positive. So with no interpreter this
# returns 2, and its callers say out loud that they could not make the
# comparison rather than making a bad one.
#
# Exit codes — identical contract to registered_hook_scripts:
#   0  complete inventory printed
#   1  no such file

# WHY THESE TWO FUNCTIONS EXIST, which is the whole lesson of 2026-09-14.
# guard-brief-scope.sh was registered as the ninth entry in hooks/hooks.json.
# Two consumers inside contract-integrity-probe.sh held their own TYPED copy of
# the chain — CANONICAL_AGENT_CHAIN for Layer C, BR_AGENT_WANT for BR2 — and
# both still said eight. Nothing was broken from the author's seat: the hook
# loaded, fired, and did its job. The engine went red on `main` because a list
# somebody typed weeks earlier disagreed with the registration, and the remedy
# those consumers PRINTED — "run scripts/hooks/install.sh" — could not fix it:
# install.sh validates two config keys, migrates a stale settings.json and mints
# sha256 sidecars, and never writes a hook stanza or touches either list.
#
# A list that must be edited when a hook is added is not a mitigation for drift.
# It IS the drift. So the MEMBERSHIP and the ORDER of the chain are derived here
# from the registration, and what stays typed is the only thing the registration
# cannot state about itself: WHY that order and not another.
#
# THE SPLIT IS THE DESIGN. Do not collapse it:
#
#   MEMBERSHIP + ORDER  are FACTS about the registration. Derived. A tenth hook
#                       registered tomorrow appears in both with no edit here.
#
#   THE ORDER INTENT    is a SPEC the registration cannot check against itself.
#                       Typed. Deriving it too would compare hooks.json against
#                       hooks.json and could never fail — failure type Z, a
#                       check that passes for a reason unrelated to what it
#                       checks, which is the type this engine keeps retiring.
#
# THE INTENT IS A PREFIX RULE, NOT A SEQUENCE, and that is deliberate. The four
# STRUCTURAL gates settle whether the SPAWN IS WELL FORMED — is it isolated and
# truthfully named, is the booted definition the one on disk, is a reading task
# routed to the reader, does the prompt carry what it must. They come first, in
# that order, because a dispatch that is malformed AND something else should
# hear about the malformed half first: that is the half the operator can fix
# without leaving the keyboard.
#
# Everything after them is a POLICY question — cost, environment, standing
# state, scope, whether the CEO was asked — and the probe's own comments already
# concede that their relative order is not load-bearing ("Against the CEO-ask
# gate the order is not load-bearing (both are policy questions), so the tie was
# broken by the merge-safe choice: appending"). Four such hooks have been
# appended since, and the comment on each one claims it is LAST. So the tail is
# left UNCONSTRAINED on purpose. A tenth policy hook appended tomorrow satisfies
# this rule untouched — the property that was missing — while a hook inserted
# AHEAD of the structural four still fails as loudly as it must.

# Prints one hook-script BASENAME per line, IN REGISTRATION ORDER — every script
# the table runs on PreToolUse under a matcher that names Agent. Deliberately
# NOT sorted and NOT de-duplicated: a duplicate registration is a real defect
# (the hook fires twice on every spawn, and Layer M exists for it), so this

#
# NO TEXT-SCAN FALLBACK, for registered_hook_rows' reason and one more: a grep
