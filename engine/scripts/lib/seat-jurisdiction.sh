# scripts/lib/seat-jurisdiction.sh — THE JURISDICTION CONTRACT.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
# ===========================================================================
# Every guard answers two questions, and until 2026-08-30 it answered them from
# two different places that were never compared:
#
#   "Am I governed?"     -> the SESSION'S SEAT, via resolve_entity_root().
#   "What am I judging?" -> the COMMAND'S OWN REPOSITORY, via the hook payload
#                           (tool_input.file_path, or ct_repo_root of the
#                           payload cwd).
#
# With the engine loaded as a USER-SCOPE plugin those two are never the same
# repository by construction: the seat is wherever the session happens to sit,
# the artifact is wherever the command points. Measured that day
# (docs/audits/seat-vs-inspection-divergence-2026-08-30.md), across the 26
# scripts hooks/hooks.json actually registers: 20 resolve a seat and 7 derived
# their inspection target independently of it.
#
# The damage was not that the guards were wrong. It was that DIVERGENCE AND
# SUCCESS WERE THE SAME BYTE. A guard whose target fell outside its seat ran off
# the end of its loop and exited 0 — identical, to every observer, to a guard
# that had looked and approved. Three consequences, all reproduced:
#
#   * a write to the REAL product source (richos/app/) exited 0;
#   * a write to richos/engine/app/ — A DIRECTORY THAT DOES NOT EXIST — was
#     blocked, because the seat had resolved to the engine subdirectory and
#     PROTECTED_PATHS was joined onto it;
#   * richos-hq, seated `not-adopted`, exited 0 for everything, silently, while
#     taking 28 commits that day.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE RULE — one sentence, and it holds for every guard
# ===========================================================================
#
#   A guard enforces on an artifact IF AND ONLY IF that artifact lies inside
#   the repository the guard resolved as its seat; an artifact outside the seat
#   is OUT OF JURISDICTION and is ANNOUNCED, never silently allowed.
#
# Note what the rule does NOT say. It does not say "block it". Blocking every
# out-of-jurisdiction artifact would brick every cross-repository operation on
# the machine, and this engine has already learned once that "refuse what you
# cannot resolve" is not the same rule as "never pretend you resolved it"
# (resolve-roots.sh, THE GOVERNING RULE). The rule says the guard must not be
# SILENT about it. Silence is the whole defect; the exit code is not.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY THE ANNOUNCEMENT IS DEDUPLICATED, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A MUTE
# ===========================================================================
# An out-of-jurisdiction artifact is normal and frequent — an agent reading
# another repository, a lander running from elsewhere. One line per (hook,
# repository, kind) per session is loud; the same line on every tool call is
# noise, and noise is how a real signal gets filtered out by a human. So the
# notice fires ONCE per triple and is then suppressed for that session.
#
# There is deliberately no configuration key that turns it off. A mute for "this
# artifact is not protected" is the silent skip walking back in through the door
# marked configuration — the exact reasoning engine-status.sh already records
# for the stood-down banner.
#
# STATE LIVES IN TMPDIR, NEVER IN A REPOSITORY. On 2026-08-28
# guard-definition-drift.sh wrote its state log into a repository that had
# nothing to do with the session; that is precisely the class of bug this file
# exists to end, so it must not reproduce it while doing so.
#
# Safe to source repeatedly. Never changes the caller's cwd.

# THE CALL EVERY DIVERGING GUARD MAKES. Returns:
#
#   rc 0  in jurisdiction  -> the guard proceeds and enforces
#   rc 1  out of jurisdiction -> ANNOUNCED, so whatever the caller does next is
#         no longer indistinguishable from a silent skip
#
# The announcement is the product. It names the hook, the seat, the artifact and
# the repository the artifact actually belongs to, so the reader can see the two
# repositories that failed to be the same one.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE FIFTH PARAMETER, AND THE DAY THAT PAID FOR IT
# ===========================================================================
# rc 1 does NOT mean the guard stood down. Ten call sites route through here and
# NINE of them proceed to judge the artifact anyway, by the TARGET repository's
# own declaration — because a guard that switched itself off on a seat mismatch
# would wave through exactly the cross-repository operation it exists to catch,
# which is stated at length in richos_governing_root below. Only
# guard-main-checkout-writes.sh's first call really declines.
#
# The banner said "the guard did NOT judge it / THIS IS NOT A PASS" to all ten.
# For nine of them that is FALSE, and on 2026-09-04 the falsehood cost a day: an
# engineer read it, reported that guard-dialect.sh does not judge files in
# cross-repository worktrees — meaning the American-English rule would have been
# unenforced for most writes on this machine, 48 of 53 worktrees — and it was
# relayed to the CEO as a finding. A second engineer replayed the exact
# configuration and measured EXIT 2 WITH A FULL REFUSAL. The guard worked; the
# message lied.
#
# A DIAGNOSTIC THAT MISREPORTS ITS OWN VERDICT IS WORSE THAN NO DIAGNOSTIC,
# because it manufactures findings, and a manufactured finding costs an engineer
# a day and a lead his credibility.
#
# So the caller says which of the two things happened:
#
#   declines  (default) the guard will NOT judge this artifact. Nothing about
#                       it was checked. This is the wording that was always
#                       right, for the one call site it was written for.
#   proceeds            the guard judged it anyway, out of the target's own
#                       declaration. What is worth saying then is not "nothing
#                       was checked" but "the CONFIGURATION may be the seat's".
#
# THE DEFAULT IS `declines` ON PURPOSE. A caller that forgets the parameter then
# under-claims — it says nothing was checked when something was — and an
# under-claim prompts a check, while an over-claim ("this was judged") is a
# false pass and is how a defense becomes a rumour. Case 4a of
# seat-jurisdiction.test.sh refuses any call site that leaves it implicit, so
# forgetting is caught rather than defaulted around.

# when no repository governs it.
#
# THIS IS THE ACTUAL RESOLUTION FIX, and it is worth being precise about why the
# obvious version is wrong.
#
# The obvious version is "if the artifact is not inside my seat, skip it". That
# closes the divergence and it is a REGRESSION, which the test suites caught
# within minutes: guard-row-currency-commits.sh and its four siblings read their
# contract out of the TARGET repository — `.row-currency`, `.ceo-todos`,
# `.publication-boundary` — and the seat contributes nothing to what they judge.
# Skipping on a seat mismatch would have switched OFF a guard that was working:
# a merge into richos-hq, refused that morning from an adopted seat, would have
# sailed through. A jurisdiction rule is never allowed to move enforcement in
# the less safe direction.
#
# So the two questions are not reconciled by adding a comparison. They are
# reconciled by ASKING BOTH OF THE SAME REPOSITORY:
#
#   the artifact's own repository governs it, if it declares anything;
#   otherwise the seat governs it, but only if the artifact is inside the seat;
#   otherwise nothing governs it, and that is said out loud.
#
# Under that resolution "am I governed?" and "what am I inspecting?" cannot
# disagree, because they are the same question about the same repository rather
# than two questions about two.

# The marker is the same one adoption uses everywhere else — nothing new to
# maintain, and no second definition of "governed" to drift.
