"""unstarted-rows.py — THE PREDICATE: is anything unblocked with nothing running for it?

Read scripts/lib/unstarted-rows.sh first; it carries the argument. This file
carries only the mechanism, because the mechanism has to be exact.

===========================================================================
THE ONE SENTENCE
===========================================================================
    A ROW THAT NAMES NOBODY AS BLOCKING IT, AND HAS NO LIVE WORKTREE
    WORKING ON IT, IS WORK THAT WAS WRITTEN DOWN INSTEAD OF STARTED. THE
    TURN DOES NOT END QUIETLY OVER IT.

Everything here is that sentence plus the precision needed to make it fire on
the right rows and on no others.

===========================================================================
THE QUEUE IS TWO FILES, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT
===========================================================================
The record this governs says so in its own header, in the lander's own words,
after the failure happened a second time:

    "THE QUEUE IS TWO FILES, NOT THIS ONE. ... An empty table here is not an
     empty queue."

A paragraph is a promise. So the two files are read as ONE corpus here, and
a half-corpus — one file present, the other missing — is BROKEN rather than a
clean sweep over whichever half survived. That is the single most important
line in this file: the defect it exists to catch is precisely "I looked at one
of them and reported an empty queue".

===========================================================================
THE TWO ROW SHAPES, AND HOW EACH ONE DECLARES A BLOCKER
===========================================================================
THE QUEUE (`RICH-TODOs.md`). A three-column table: an id, the item, and a
`Blocked by` cell. THAT CELL IS THE DECLARATION and it already exists — on the
day this was commissioned, four rows were legitimately the CEO's (a dead
Railway login, an uninstalled dictation journal, a GitHub Actions billing
block, an absent Windows toolchain) and all four already named what they were
waiting on. Nothing was invented for them; they are silent because the file
was already carrying the fact.

  nothing named   ""  "-"  "—"  "–"  "n/a"  "none"  "nobody"  "nothing"
  closed          the id cell is struck through, and the cell says "done"
  anything else   a named blocker: SILENT

THE SECTION (`wiki/open-items.md` section 3, "Buildable now — nobody blocked").
Every row there carries a warrant — a status token plus pinned object ids — and
that token is the state. But a warrant cannot say WHO a row waits on, and the
page's own contract is that an item waiting on the CEO moves to section 1 or 2.
Rows do not always move the moment they should, so there is one in-place
declaration, in a shape both files accept:

    **Blocked:** the CEO — his Railway credentials

Put it in the row's prose, BEFORE the `**State:**` warrant. It is deliberately
the same construct as the queue's `Blocked by` cell wearing markdown: one way
to say one thing. It does not disturb the row-currency contract, which reads
`**State:**` and nothing else.

WHY NOT A NEW WARRANT TOKEN. Because `.row-currency` declares the vocabulary
and rejects an unknown key or an unknown token by design, so a new token means
editing an enforced contract to add a word that means "not enforced here" —
and because the state of the WORK ("BOUNDED") and who it WAITS ON are two
different facts that must not be crammed into one slot.

===========================================================================
GREEN OVER AN EMPTY SET IS THE FAILURE THIS ENGINE KEEPS COMMITTING
===========================================================================
A scanner reporting CLEAN over an empty corpus; a runner reporting all-passed
over a suite it was not running. So every one of these is BROKEN, loudly, and
never a clean sweep:

  * either file absent, unreadable or empty
  * the queue's governed table not found by its header shape, or found twice
  * the queue table parsed to ZERO rows
  * a queue row whose id cell is empty after markdown is stripped
  * a queue row that is NOT struck through and whose cell says it is done
  * the governed section absent from the record, or holding ZERO rows
  * a section row with no warrant, or with a status token outside the
    declared vocabulary
  * one id appearing in both files, so a claim could mean either
  * scripts/lib/row-currency.py absent — the section parser lives there and
    this file will not grow a second copy of that grammar

INPUT — one JSON job, path given as argv[1] (or "-" for stdin)
    {
      "queue_label":   "RICH-TODOs.md",
      "queue_text":    "<the file>",
      "record_label":  "wiki/open-items.md",
      "record_text":   "<the file>",
      "row_sections":  ["3"],
      "status_tokens": ["OPEN","BUILT","BOUNDED","BLOCKED-ON-RICH","CLOSED"],
      "terminal_tokens":  ["CLOSED"],
      "actionable_tokens":["OPEN","BUILT","BOUNDED"],
      "claims": {"worktrees": [{"where": "...", "hay": "branch + dirname",
                                "ids": ["11", "3.1"]}]}
    }

OUTPUT — tab-separated lines on stdout. First line is the verdict:

    SWEPT       <swept> <unstarted> <claimed> <declared> <closed> <other>
    UNSTARTED   <count> <swept> <claimed> <declared> <closed> <other>
    BROKEN      <reason>

then one line per row, in document order:

    ROW  <state>  <id>  <where>  <detail>

where <state> is UNSTARTED | CLAIMED | DECLARED | CLOSED | OTHER.

EXIT  0 always, unless the job itself is unreadable (2). The VERDICT is the
      product: a non-zero exit would make "there is unstarted work" and "the
      checker is broken" the same signal to every caller.
