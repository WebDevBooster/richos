# scripts/lib/vendored-material.sh — WHOSE WORK IS THIS? ANSWERED IN ONE PLACE,
#                                     FOR EVERY MECHANISM THAT ASKS.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
# ===========================================================================
# On 2026-09-04 a publication audit found that 15 of this engine's 27 skills
# came from outside the project, and that exactly ONE of those vendorings had
# ever been written down — in a commit message. Reconstructing the other
# fourteen cost a full agent doing byte comparisons against upstream
# repositories, and two verdicts came back short of certain because the
# evidence had decayed.
#
# In a completely unrelated mechanism, guard-dialect.sh Americanized FOURTEEN
# lines across TWO vendored MIT-licensed skills (commit 06f4a8221a61,
# 2026-08-30): `engine/skills/copywriting/references/natural-transitions.md` and
# `engine/skills/landing-page-taste/SKILL.md`. The guard behaved exactly as
# designed. It had no way to know those files were somebody else's — and,
# because it refuses a write carrying a foreign spelling, it also forbade
# re-vendoring them verbatim and forbade quoting the difference in a notice.
#
#   ONE MISSING FACT, TWO UNRELATED FAILURES. The fact is now data, in
#   `.richos/vendored-material`, and this file is the ONLY thing that reads it.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY A LIBRARY AND NOT A PARSER IN EACH CALLER
# ===========================================================================
# Two callers today (guard-vendoring-commits.sh, guard-dialect.sh) and more
# later. This engine has already paid for the alternative twice: a typed guard
# inventory drifted in two days (scripts/lib/registered-hooks.sh), and a
# hand-rolled git-target resolver put the same hole in five files
# (scripts/lib/git-jurisdiction.sh). A second parser of one file is a second
# answer to one question, and the two diverge on the day nobody is looking.
#
# ===========================================================================
# NO SILENT DEGRADATION
# ===========================================================================
# Three outcomes, and the caller MUST distinguish them:
#
#   rc 0  loaded    — the repository declares the contract and the registry
#                     parsed. VM_* below are populated.
#   rc 1  absent    — this repository declares nothing. The caller stands down.
#                     A repository that has made no claim about its vendored
#                     material must not have one invented for it.
#   rc 2  BROKEN    — VM_BROKEN_REASON is set and the caller must BLOCK. A
#                     declared-but-unreadable registry is an enforcement outage
#                     that looks exactly like a clean run, which is the shape of
#                     defect this whole file is a response to.
#
# Safe to source repeatedly. Never mutates state, never changes the caller's cwd.
