"""ci-run-records.py — match pushes against workflow runs, and name what is missing.

The comparison half of `ci-run-record-check.sh`, separated so it can be tested
against captured payloads with no network and no token. The reasoning it
encodes, once:

  A PUSH IS THE UNIT, NOT A COMMIT. `on: push` fires once per push, against the
  pushed head. Five commits in one push correctly produce one run, so a check
  built on commits reports four false gaps per batch and gets switched off.

  A MISSING RUN IS NOT A FAILED RUN. A run that exists and failed is somebody's
  bug and is visible. A run that never existed is invisible, and every tool that
  reads "the latest run" reports the PREVIOUS commit's verdict in its place.
  That is the case here.

  A PUSH INSIDE THE GRACE WINDOW IS PENDING, NOT MISSING. Its run may not have
  reached the API yet. Named on every run so the tolerance is never invisible.

  NO ANSWER IS NOT A PASS. If the payloads cannot be read, this exits 2 with the
  reason. A run-record check that goes quiet when its sources fail is the defect
  it exists to catch, one level out.

  A MISSING VERDICT NEEDS PROOF OF COVERAGE, AND ABSENCE FROM A PAGE IS NOT
  PROOF. Added 2026-09-14, when this file's first real finding turned out to be
  its own pagination: the caller read one page of runs, the oldest of which was
  2026-09-10T07:09:05Z, and reported two pushes from the half hour before it as
  having no run at all. Both had runs, on page 2 — 0fb68b7c run #101 (success)
  and de6ca1f8 run #107 (FAILURE). "Missing" is a claim about the world; what
  was actually known was the edge of a window.

  So a push is only MISSING where the run list provably covers it: the list was
  exhausted, or the push is newer than the oldest run fetched. Anything else is
  UNCOVERED — named, not counted as a finding, exit 2. This matters beyond
  tidiness because the remedy printed below tells the operator to move --since
  past a permanent gap, and taking that advice here would have buried a real
  failing run behind a note saying nothing was at risk.
