# seat-jurisdiction.test.sh — THE TEST THAT OUTLIVES THE FIX.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
# ===========================================================================
# On 2026-08-30 it was established that every guard decides WHETHER TO RUN from
# the session's seat and WHAT TO INSPECT from the command's repository, and that
# in a by-reference installation those are never the same repository. Seven of
# the twenty seat-resolving guards derived their inspection target with no
# reference to their seat at all, and when the two diverged the guard exited 0 —
# the same byte as a pass.
#
# Fixing those seven is worth little on its own. The eighth is written next
# week, by someone who never read this file, and it will reintroduce the defect
# unless something mechanical refuses. So the deliverable is not the fix, it is
# this suite:
#
#   STRUCTURAL (cases 1.x)  Derives the guard set from hooks/hooks.json and
#                           FAILS if any registered guard can let its seat
#                           decision and its inspection target diverge. A new
#                           guard with the old shape turns this red on the day
#                           it is written.
#
#   BEHAVIORAL (cases 2.x) Drives the real guards against real sandbox repos
#                           and asserts that divergence and stand-down are LOUD.
#                           Silence and success must not look the same.
#
#   NEGATIVE CONTROLS       Both halves are mutated to prove they can fail. Two
#   (cases 3.x)             mechanisms on 2026-08-30 reported green because they
#                           read nothing; a suite that cannot be shown to go red
#                           is one of them waiting to happen.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY THE STRUCTURAL CHECK IS DERIVED, NEVER TYPED
# ===========================================================================
# A typed list of 14 over a registration of 15 is the drift that opened this
# whole sequence. The guard inventory here comes from the same library the
# session banner and the integrity probe use — scripts/lib/registered-hooks.sh,
# reading hooks/hooks.json, the file that actually determines what the host
# loads. If this suite ever scans zero guards it FAILS rather than passing
# vacuously (case 1a).

#
# It returned the seat verbatim while richos_repo_of returned it physicalized,
# so the same function answered in two spellings. On macOS TMPDIR lives under
# /var, a symlink to /private/var, so the guard compared a logical governing
# root against a physicalized seat, concluded a FOREIGN repository governed the
# file, and then matched PROTECTED_PATHS with the wrong spelling: it ran every
# branch, printed nothing, blocked nothing, and exited 0. Contract-integrity
# Layer D caught it only once seat-jurisdiction.sh was added to the sandbox file
# lists — before that the guard was missing its library and exited 2, which is
# the number Layer D wanted, for the opposite reason.
