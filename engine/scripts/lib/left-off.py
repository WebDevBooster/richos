"""left-off.py -- WHERE HE LEFT OFF, ASSEMBLED FROM THINGS THAT CANNOT LIE.

===========================================================================
THE DEFECT
===========================================================================
2026-09-15. The CEO came back after a nine-hour break and asked "TLDR, plain
English". He was answered about a guard-deletion step, because that is what
the lead was holding. Five further attempts each answered a different thing.
It took SIXTEEN MESSAGES AND THIRTY-NINE MINUTES before he got the one line he
wanted, and he got it only after re-pasting his own messages from the night
before, repeatedly, in capitals:

    "HOW MANY MORE FUCKING MESSAGES FROM LAST NIGHT DO I NEED TO COPY AND
     PASTE HERE????"

Recorded as failure types 60 and 61 in richos-hq's
docs/verification/all-lifecycle-failure-records.md:

  TYPE 60  he returns after a gap and is told what the LEAD is currently
           holding instead of the thing HE left on. The aggravating detail,
           and the reason it is a type rather than an oversight: two turns
           before the answer, the lead PRINTED his 21:39 message on screen
           while computing the gap -- and still answered something else.
           RETRIEVAL WAS NOT THE FAILURE. SUBSTITUTING THE LEAD'S AGENDA FOR
           HIS WAS.

  TYPE 61  a deterministic lookup exists, takes seconds, and the question is
           answered from memory instead. And the trap inside the remedy: when
           a ledger finally WAS read, its `runtime_state` field was taken at
           face value and produced "19 jobs were dispatched and never closed
           out". All 19 had landed. The field records the LAST OBSERVED EVENT,
           never the outcome.

===========================================================================
WHAT THIS FILE IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
===========================================================================
IT IS NOT A GUARD. It refuses nothing, blocks nothing and has no exit code
anybody has to clear. The standing rule since 2026-09-14 is that a new guard
costs a deleted one; this is not a guard, it is an ANSWER delivered before the
question is asked.

It assembles three things, and every one of them is an artifact rather than a
claim:

  1. HIS LAST MESSAGE BEFORE THE GAP, verbatim, plus the sitting it ended --
     from the session transcript, which records every message with a
     timestamp.

  2. WHAT RAN ACROSS THE GAP AND WHERE IT ENDED UP -- the jobs from the
     transcript's own task notifications (title + token cost), and the
     outcome FROM GIT: the integration branch's REFLOG, cross-checked by
     ancestry. Never from a status field. See "THE OUTCOME COMES FROM GIT"
     below -- this is the half that type 61 is about.

  3. WHAT LANDED IN THAT WINDOW -- `git log --since ... --until ...` on every
     repository this session touched.

===========================================================================
THE OUTCOME COMES FROM GIT, AND THE OBVIOUS GIT CHECK IS THE WRONG ONE
===========================================================================
The obvious implementation asks `git merge-base --is-ancestor cc/<name> main`.
Measured against the very incident this file exists for, THAT CHECK ANSWERS
"branch does not exist" FOR EVERY LANDED JOB:

    $ git -C /Users/alex/ab/richos for-each-ref refs/heads/ \
        | grep -E 'silent1|vdesign1|derive1|r9fix1'
    (nothing)

The land sequence merges the branch and then deletes it, so ancestry is
unanswerable for exactly the work that succeeded -- and a check that cannot
distinguish "landed and cleaned up" from "never existed" would have reproduced
the 19-jobs error with git's authority behind it.

THE REFLOG IS THE ARTIFACT THAT SURVIVES THE DELETION:

    $ git -C /Users/alex/ab/richos reflog show main --date=iso
    de525f19 main@{2026-09-14 22:46:23 +0100}: merge cc/zach-opus-silent1: Fast-forward
    e6b54777 main@{2026-09-14 23:29:45 +0100}: merge cc/sage-opus-vdesign1: Merge made by the 'ort' strategy
    2545d7f1 main@{2026-09-15 01:09:44 +0100}: merge cc/tom-opus-derive1: Fast-forward

It records the instant the integration branch absorbed the work, it names the
branch, and it outlives the ref. So the verdict is:

  LANDED       the reflog names the branch AND the commit it moved to is still
               an ancestor of the integration tip. TWO git facts, because a
               reflog entry alone can name a commit a later reset discarded.
  NOT LANDED   the branch ref still exists and is not an ancestor of the tip.
               Carries the commits-ahead count.
  NO TRACE     neither. Said in those words. NOT "not landed" -- a reflog is
               local and expirable and a teammate may have worked in a
               repository this sweep never looked in. An honest "I cannot see
               it" is the one verdict that cannot mislead, and the 19-jobs
               error is what happens when a tool guesses instead.

===========================================================================
WHICH MESSAGES ARE HIS -- DERIVED, NOT ASSUMED
===========================================================================
A transcript's `user` rows are mostly NOT the user. Over all 766 transcripts on
this machine, every distinct provenance of a text-bearing `user` row:

    $ python3 ... over ~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl        (2026-09-15)
      2047  kind=human   src=typed                meta=False   <- HIM
      1348  kind=task-notification  src=system    meta=False
       683  kind=<null>  src=sdk                  meta=False
       443  kind=<null>  src=None                 meta=True    "Continue from where you left off."
       229  kind=<null>  src=None                 meta=False   <command-name>/exit</command-name>
        74  kind=peer    src=system               meta=True    another session's agent
        73  kind=human   src=sdk                  meta=False   a harness driving a session
        53  kind=human   src=queued               meta=False   <- HIM, typed while busy
        24  kind=human   src=suggestion_accepted  meta=False   <- HIM, one click
        14  kind=<null>  src=system               meta=True    fallback wakeup
         9  kind=task-notification  src=sdk       meta=False

So the predicate is: origin.kind == "human", promptSource is not "sdk", and
isMeta is falsy. 2124 rows of 5000.

`queued` IS HIM AND IS THE ONE A HAND-WRITTEN PREDICATE MISSES. He types while
the assistant is mid-turn constantly -- on the morning this file exists for he
sent the same message twice in forty seconds. A predicate keyed to `typed`
alone drops 53 of his messages on this machine, and it drops them silently.

The fallback, for a host version that stops emitting `origin`: any text-bearing
user row that is not meta, not a compact summary, and does not open with one of
the machine-written envelopes. It is WIDER and it is announced as degraded in
the report itself, because a report that silently changed its definition of
"him" would be the substitution failure again.

===========================================================================
THE CURRENT PROMPT IS EXCLUDED BY IDENTITY, NOT BY TIMING
===========================================================================
At UserPromptSubmit it is not knowable, and not stable across host versions,
whether the arriving message has already been appended to the transcript. So
this does not guess and does not measure: the caller passes the prompt TEXT,
and a trailing human row whose text matches it and which is less than
CURRENT_PROMPT_WINDOW_S old is dropped. If the row is not there yet, nothing
matches and the answer is identical. Both orders are covered in the suite.

===========================================================================
COST
===========================================================================
Measured on the 18 MB, 10031-line transcript of the session this was written
in, with three repositories in scope (femcboost, richos, richos-hq):

    full report, three runs   real 1.45  1.48  1.44
    no gap, three runs        real 0.17  0.19  0.18

The no-gap case is the common one and it stops before any git call at all.
Evidence and the commands: docs/verification/left-off-2026-09-15.md.

Usage:
    left-off.py --transcript P [--now ISO] [--prompt-file F] [--event E]
                [--gap-minutes N] [--entity-root R] [--session S]
                [--ledger L] [--format json|text]

Exit: 0 a report was produced, 1 nothing to report (no gap), 2 could not read.
