"""inflight.py — THE PREDICATE. Who is in flight, who is behind, who was told,
and who has proved they heard it.

===========================================================================
WHAT THIS ANSWERS, AND WHY IT IS ONE FILE
===========================================================================
Landing moves `main`. Every teammate still working was cut from an older base
and is now silently behind. `rich-lander/SKILL.md` §8b is the written step that
says to sweep them; this file is the machine underneath it, and it is a single
file for the reason `row-currency.py` is: a predicate kept in two copies is the
defect class this engine keeps finding in itself.

Four consumers, one predicate:

    scripts/hooks/guard-inflight-notify.sh   BLOCKS a push that leaves a live
                                             teammate behind and un-notified.
    scripts/hooks/notice-inflight-acks.sh    Stop-hook notice: notified, but
                                             no ack, past the timeout.
    scripts/inflight-notify.sh               the by-hand runner (status /
                                             check / waive / acks).
    scripts/inflight-ack.sh                  the teammate's ack writer, which
                                             uses only the ack-path rule here.

===========================================================================
THE THREE FACTS, AND WHERE EACH ONE COMES FROM
===========================================================================
1. WHO IS IN FLIGHT — `git worktree list --porcelain`, in the repository being
   landed. Not a roster, not the SendMessage agent list: a worktree is a thing
   on disk with a branch and a base, and it is the only in-flight record that
   survives the lead's context.

2. WHO WAS TOLD — an append-only ledger written by a PostToolUse[SendMessage]
   hook, in the LEAD's own execution, at the moment the tool call resolves.
   This is the same trick worker-updated-handoff.sh uses and it is the whole
   reason the send half can be guaranteed at all: the witness observes the
   SEND, not the delivery, so it is true even when the mailbox drops the
   message. The lander cannot satisfy it by remembering to write a file — the
   only way to produce the record is to actually call SendMessage.

   IT IS NOT FRAUD-PROOF, and that is stated rather than implied: anyone with
   Bash can append a line to a JSONL file. The failure being engineered out is
   FORGETTING, which is what happened twice on 2026-08-30. Fabrication is a
   different act and this guard does not pretend to stop it.

3. WHO HEARD IT — an append-only row in ~/.claude/state/inflight-acks.jsonl,
   written by the teammate. A reply the lead may never receive proves nothing
   to the lead; a record the lead can read proves it, and it proves it after
   the session that sent the message is gone.

   IT LIVED IN THE TEAMMATE'S WORKTREE UNTIL 2026-09-05, AND THAT IS WHERE IT
   DIED. Both governed repositories gitignore `.claude/*`; the harness
   auto-cleans an isolation worktree that is UNCHANGED at completion; and a
   gitignored write does not make a tree changed. So an agent whose only writes
   were acks had its worktree, and every ack in it, deleted the moment it
   finished — and an ack that was written, confirmed and then deleted reads at
   the 30-minute timeout exactly like an ack that was never written. The
   worktree file is still written and still read, because every ack already on
   disk is one; it is now the readable mirror and the ledger is the record. See
   ack_status() for exactly which parts a machine checks and which part it
   cannot, and orphan_ledger_acks() for the case the whole change is about.

AND, UNDERNEATH ALL THREE, WHO A TEAMMATE IS — scripts/lib/teammate-identity.py,
imported rather than re-derived. Facts 2 and 3 are joined by NAME, and until
2026-08-31 this file resolved that name from `worker-events.jsonl`'s
`agent_type`, which is the ROLE (`zach`), while the witness recorded
SendMessage's `to`, which is the mandatory unique name (`zach-opus-s1`). Two
notices that were genuinely sent, witnessed and logged were reported as
OWED-NO-NOTICE and waived through, because one half of the engine wrote `zach`
and the other wrote `zach-opus-s1`. There is now ONE definition of a teammate's
name and both halves import it.

===========================================================================
LIVENESS — TWO KINDS OF WORKTREE, TWO DIFFERENT ANSWERS
===========================================================================
NATIVE (`.claude/worktrees/agent-<id>`): the harness locks it while the agent
runs, and the lock line carries a pid. That is the authoritative signal the
rest of the engine already uses (remove-agent-worktree.sh). locked + live pid
= LIVE; locked + dead pid = stale lock, not live; unlocked = not live.

HAND-ROLLED (any other registered worktree — the shape this whole operation
actually runs in: /Users/alex/ab/richos-wt/<name>): NO LOCK IS EVER TAKEN, so
the lock signal says nothing at all. Absence of a lock here is absence of
evidence, and the doctrine is explicit that an agent is never inferred dead
from filesystem quiet. So a hand-rolled worktree is PRESUMED LIVE.

That presumption is deliberately the over-blocking direction, and it is bounded
by two things that cost the lander seconds rather than minutes: a worktree
whose branch is already contained in the tip is discharged automatically (it
has landed — there is nothing to tell it), and anything else can be waived with
a recorded reason. An unbounded presumption with no way out would be the
"guard that wedges the session" this was explicitly told not to build.

===========================================================================
WHAT IS OWED — AND WHY RELEVANCE IS NOT FILTERED
===========================================================================
A live worktree is owed a notice when the tip contains commits its base does
not. NOT "when the moved files overlap its own files".

That is not laziness, it is the second of the two failures §8b was written
from. The library agent did not TOUCH the twelve new design variations; it
CONSUMED them, and shipped 7 of 19 because nobody told it they existed. A
path-overlap filter would have cleared that agent as unaffected. Overlap is
computed and REPORTED, because it separates "will hit a merge conflict" from
"may be building on a stale fact", and the second is the one that needs a human
sentence rather than a diff. It is never used to excuse a notice.

    THE ADDRESS IS THE JOIN. A notice records who it was addressed to; a
    worktree resolves to the set of things that address it (its unique spawn
    name, its agent id, its directory). Equality between the two is the whole
    rule, and it is exact.

    The witness now also records `to_agent_id` — resolved at send time, in the
    lead's own execution, from the same identity module — so the first reading
    does not depend on the debt side being able to resolve the name at all.
    Two independent exact paths to the same fact; either one suffices.

    THE ADDRESS BOOK HAS TWO ENTRIES PER TEAMMATE, because SendMessage takes
    two forms and both are legal: the unique spawn name, and — its own
    documentation says so, "use the raw agentId when the agent has no name" —
    the bare agent id. The lead used the SECOND form on 2026-09-01, and the
    fixed guard immediately reported OWED-NO-NOTICE against a notice that had
    been sent, witnessed and logged, because a HAND-ROLLED worktree in another
    repository has no agent id of its own to compare against. Same defect
    class, one layer over: the halves agreed about the teammate and disagreed
    about which of its two legal addresses counts.

    So the notice's recipient is expanded through the identity index BEFORE
    matching — an id to its name, a name to its id — and either form finds the
    same teammate. The expansion is the exact index, so it adds no guess.

    NO ROLE FALLBACK. `zach-opus-s1` is not credited to a worktree known only
    as `zach`: three Zachs ran at once on the day of the defect, and a
    role-prefix credit would report a teammate as told when a different
    teammate was told. When nothing resolves, the debt stands and the report
    names the sources that came up empty.

# THE DURABLE ACK LEDGER — row 3.19
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE ARTIFACT ABOVE LIVES IN A DISPOSABLE TREE, AND THE TREE IS DISPOSED OF.
#
# The harness auto-cleans a native isolation worktree that is UNCHANGED at
# completion, and a gitignored write does not make a tree changed. Both
# repositories this engine governs ignore `.claude/*` — femcboost since it
# adopted the engine, and richos since c19cd83 on 2026-09-02, which UNTRACKED
# all 31 acks that had been committed there because they carry the operator's
# absolute home paths, teammate names and session ids and that repository is
# the open-source launch target. So an agent whose only writes were acks has
# its worktree, and every ack in it, deleted the moment it finishes.
#
# That is not a theory. echo-opus-529 reported three acks by path on
# 2026-09-05 — 361590f, 363b0f8, c92488d — and named, in its own handoff, the
# ignore rule that doomed them. All three are absent from the whole of
# /Users/alex/ab today. zach-opus-not1 hit the other half of it: after its
# worktree was cleaned, inflight-ack.sh REFUSED its next ack outright with
# "worktree does not exist", so it could no longer answer at all.
#
# An ack that was written, confirmed and then deleted reads exactly like an ack
# that was never written. That is this project's recurring failure class —
# nothing distinguishes "worked" from "never ran" — and the fix is the one the
# rest of this engine already uses for facts that must outlive the thing that
# produced them: an append-only ledger outside every repository, every worktree
# and every session, beside ~/.claude/state/worktree-ledger.jsonl and
# ~/.claude/state/escalations.jsonl.
#
# WHY NOT UN-IGNORE THE DIRECTORY INSTEAD (row 3.19's option 2): it fixes one
# repository and leaves the mechanism repository-dependent, which IS the
# defect; and it is refuted by a commit LATER than the row, because putting
# those files back under version control re-publishes the operator's home paths
# into the v1 launch target. WHY NOT HAVE A HOOK WRITE IT (option 3): the
# question is WHERE the evidence lives, not WHO writes it. A hook writing into
# the same disposable tree would evaporate identically.

    THREE CHANNELS, AND THEY PROVE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS.

    DURABLE — a row in ~/.claude/state/inflight-acks.jsonl, written by the same
    command that writes the artifact, in a file that is outside every
    repository, every worktree and every session. It is listed first because it
    is the only one of the three that is still there after the teammate's
    worktree has been removed, which — as row 3.19 records — is the normal end
    of a teammate's life rather than an edge case. It carries the identical
    fields and is held to the identical checks; the only thing it cannot do is
    re-check `paths` against a workspace that no longer exists, and where that
    bites it SAYS SO instead of passing quietly.

    PRIMARY-BY-HISTORY — the artifact at <worktree>/.claude/inflight-acks/<tip12>.ack,
    written by the teammate (scripts/inflight-ack.sh writes it). Independent of
    the mailbox in both directions, survives the session, and the lead verifies
    it with stat + read. Machine-checkable:
        sha:     must equal the full 40-char tip EXACTLY. A teammate that does
                 not hold the new fact cannot produce it.
        impact:  one of conflict / stale-record / grew-scope / none — §8b's own
                 three questions plus "not affected", forcing a choice rather
                 than a nod.
        detail:  >= 40 characters of the teammate's own words.
        paths:   repo-relative paths, each of which must EXIST in that
                 teammate's worktree or in the moved changeset — the one field
                 that cannot be filled by copying the notice, because it is
                 about the teammate's own workspace.

    WHAT NO MACHINE HERE CAN CHECK, stated plainly rather than dressed up: the
    `detail` line is checked for LENGTH and for not being a copy of anything in
    the notice. Whether it is CORRECT — whether the teammate actually
    understood which of its assumptions broke — is comprehension, and a string
    match is not comprehension. The verifier prints `detail` and labels it
    HUMAN JUDGMENT REQUIRED. A guard that scored that line would be inventing a
    reading it did not do.

    SECONDARY — a witnessed reply: a WorkerUpdated row in worker-events.jsonl
    from this teammate, after the notice, with the tip's short SHA in its
    `summary`. That hook fires inside the SENDER's execution when its tool call
    resolves, so it witnesses the send even when delivery drops — a durable
    substrate, not a mailbox read. It is secondary because that log stores only
    the 200-character summary, so it can carry a token but never a restatement.
