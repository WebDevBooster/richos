# mutation-pool.test.sh — PROVE THE POOL BEFORE 526 MUTANTS RUN THROUGH IT.
#
# The pool's failure modes are all quiet. It does not crash; it reports a
# plausible tally in a plausible order and is wrong about which mutant said
# what, or about how many ran at all. Every property below is one whose
# violation produces a green-looking report:
#
#   P1   Order is SUBMISSION order, not completion order. Proven with workers
#        whose durations are deliberately reversed, so a pool that printed in
#        finishing order would print exactly backwards. Without this, two runs
#        of the same harness cannot be diffed.
#   P2   The tally comes from exit codes and matches the bodies.
#   P3   A worker that leaves NO exit code is a FAILURE, named. This is the
#        `kill -9` case, and the one that would otherwise shrink the
#        denominator and print green over a mutant that never ran.
#   P4   Concurrency actually happens — total work / wall clock > 1. A pool that
#        silently serialized would pass P1, P2 and P3 and buy nothing, which is
#        the whole point of the change.
#   P5   The degree is RESPECTED as an upper bound. Proven by having the workers
#        themselves record concurrent occupancy, so the assertion is on observed
#        overlap and not on the variable the pool set.
#   P6   RICHOS_MUTATION_INNER=1 forces degree 1. Each mutant runs a whole
#        suite; if that suite pooled too, the process count would be the product
#        of the levels. The bound must be JOBS, never JOBS squared.
#   P7   RICHOS_MUTANT_JOBS is honored, and junk in it is refused loudly rather
#        than silently becoming 0 (a degree of 0 would hang the throttle for
#        ever).
#   P8   Body stdout is reproduced VERBATIM, so contract-integrity.test.sh's
#        `grep -E '^  FAIL'` keeps matching byte for byte.
#   P9   A body that prints nothing and a zero-mutant pool are both handled
#        without a false tally.
#
# Everything runs in the pool's own temp dirs. Nothing is written to any tree.

# P3c: A KILLED WORKER MUST FREE ITS SLOT. This case exists because the pool
# deadlocked, and a mutation of the pool is what found it rather than a review.
# The first throttle counted `*.done` markers and treated everything else as
# occupied; a SIGKILLed worker never writes a marker, so it held its slot for
# ever. At degree 1 the next submit blocked immediately and permanently.
#
# Run at DEGREE 1 deliberately: that is the configuration in which the defect is
# an instant hang rather than a slow leak, and degree 1 is a real configuration
# (RICHOS_MUTATION_INNER forces it).
#
# THE ASSERTION IS ON `_mut_pool_occupied` DIRECTLY, NOT ON A TIMED `submit`,
# and that is a correction to this very case. The first version called
# mut_pool_submit behind a 15s alarm that killed the suite. It did detect the
# hang — but by SIGTERMing the whole run, so the case could never print its own
# verdict and the mutation reported a MISFIRE at rc=143 rather than a red P3c. A
# case that can only fail by killing its suite is a case that reports nothing.
# Polling the predicate is bounded by construction and cannot hang.
