# scripts/lib/unstarted-rows.sh — WRITING THE WORK DOWN IS NOT STARTING IT.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
# ===========================================================================
# The lead finds work, writes it down as a row, and stops — because writing the
# row satisfies the same urge as doing the work. On 2026-08-31, three times in
# one day:
#
#   1. It emptied the queue's table, announced "the backlog is essentially
#      you", and stopped — while the working record's section 3, a section
#      LITERALLY TITLED "Buildable now — nobody blocked", still held open rows.
#   2. It found four payload defects, opened four rows, and dispatched one.
#   3. It told the CEO "Zach is building it now" about THIS HOOK, and had not
#      dispatched it. He caught it by asking where the fourth agent was.
#
# THE PROSE FIX ALREADY FAILED. After (1) the lead amended the queue's own
# header to say the queue is two files and an empty table is not an empty
# queue. That text is still there, in his own words, and (2) and (3) happened
# anyway within hours.
#
#   A RULE ENFORCED BY ATTENTION LASTS EXACTLY AS LONG AS THE ATTENTION.
#
# That sentence is written at the top of two other predicates in this engine.
# It is the same defect a third time, and a paragraph a person wrote for
# themselves is the weakest form of it.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE EVENT IS THE TURN END, NOT THE LAND — the whole design decision
# ===========================================================================
# There is already a rule that fires when a land ends: start the top unblocked
# item before reporting. It did not catch any of the three, and the reason is
# structural rather than a matter of degree.
#
#   WORK IS CREATED WHEN SOMETHING IS NOTICED, AND NOTICING HAPPENS WHILE
#   WRITING A REPORT. By the time a land ends, the noticing turn is over.
#
# Failure (3) is the clean proof: nothing landed. A row was created and a
# sentence was said about it in the same turn, and no land-shaped gate could
# ever have been standing there. So this fires at EVERY turn end — and the
# reporting turn, the one where this dies, is the one it must catch.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT IT COSTS TO GET THIS WRONG IN EITHER DIRECTION
# ===========================================================================
# TOO LOUD. A row genuinely waiting on the CEO — his machine, his billing, his
# decision, a toolchain that is not on this Mac — shouted about every turn
# trains the eye to skip the line, and a muted notice is worse than none: the
# gap is still there and now there is a line on screen that reports it, which
# nobody reads. Two mechanisms hold that down, and neither is a threshold:
#
#   * A ROW DECLARES ITS BLOCKER, AND A DECLARED BLOCKER IS SILENT. In the
#     queue that is the `Blocked by` cell the table already has; in the
#     section it is `**Blocked:** <who>` in the row's prose. On the day this
#     was written, all four genuinely-CEO rows were ALREADY silent under that
#     rule, with no edit to anything, because the record was already carrying
#     the fact.
#   * THE NOTICE IS STATE-CHANGE DE-DUPLICATED, through the same ledger every
#     other Stop notice uses (scripts/lib/stop-hook-notice.sh). A stable set of
#     unstarted rows is announced ONCE. It speaks again when the SET changes —
#     which is precisely the moment a row is created and not started, and
#     precisely the moment one is finally picked up.
#
# TOO QUIET. Silence must never be producible by the check failing to look.
# Every unreadable, unparseable or empty-corpus condition is LOUD, listed in
# scripts/lib/unstarted-rows.py, and the sweep writes a RECEIPT on every run —
# so "it said nothing" can always be told apart from "it did not run".
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT IT CANNOT SEE — stated here, not discovered later
# ===========================================================================
#   * WHETHER A CLAIM IS TRUE. A worktree named for a row is taken at its word.
#     The claim is cheap to make and nobody gains from a false one; the
#     expensive direction is the other one, and that fails loud.
#   * WORK RUNNING WITH NO WORKTREE — a teammate on somebody else's machine, a
#     job in CI, a thing the CEO is doing himself. It has no observable trace
#     here and will be reported as unstarted. `**Blocked:**` is the answer.
#   * WHETHER THE ROW IS WORTH DOING. It reads states, never prose. A row that
#     should be deleted is reported until somebody deletes it, which is the
#     correct nag.
#   * A TURN IN A SESSION THAT DID NOT LOAD THIS HOOK. Hooks snapshot at
#     session start; engine-status.sh announces that at every session start.
