# scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh — THE ROOT-RESOLUTION CONTRACT.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
# ===========================================================================
# Every guard under scripts/hooks/ used to resolve exactly ONE thing it called
# "the repo root", from its own on-disk location:
#
#     SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
#     REPO_ROOT="$(cd "$SCRIPT_DIR/../.." && pwd)"
#
# That is correct only while the engine IS the repository it governs. The
# moment the engine is loaded BY REFERENCE — as a Claude Code plugin, from a
# directory nested inside some other repository — the single "repo root" has to
# mean two different things at once, and it silently picks the wrong one:
#
#   * `SCRIPT_DIR/../..`                       -> the ENGINE directory
#   * `resolve_main_checkout "$SCRIPT_DIR"`    -> the repository ENCLOSING the
#                                                 engine (one level too high)
#   * neither                                  -> the session's own repository
#
# Measured, not theorised (step-1 audit, 2026-08-28): with the engine loaded as
# a plugin, `guard-worktree-isolation.sh` found the ENGINE's config and carried
# on with the wrong entity's values; `session-start-reap-worktrees.sh` and
# `snapshot-agent-definitions.sh` resolved to the enclosing repository, found
# nothing, and SILENTLY SKIPPED; and `guard-definition-drift.sh` WROTE ITS
# STATE LOG INTO A REPOSITORY THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SESSION.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE CONTRACT — two roots, never one
# ===========================================================================
#
#   ENGINE_ROOT  Where the engine's own bytes live. Owns: scripts/lib/*,
#                scripts/reap-stale-worktrees.sh, VERSION, the engine's own
#                .claude/agents/ (its shipped meta-roles), hooks/hooks.json.
#                READ-ONLY at run time. NEVER a write target unless it also
#                happens to BE the entity root.
#                Resolution: $RICHOS_ENGINE_ROOT -> $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT ->
#                            <script dir>/../..   (always succeeds; the script
#                            is by definition on disk)
#
#   ENTITY_ROOT  The MAIN checkout of the repository this session governs.
#                Owns: orchestration.config, .claude/agents/, .claude/state/,
#                .claude/worktrees/, .claude/settings*.json, and every
#                PROTECTED_PATHS tree. This is the ONLY legitimate write target
#                and the ONLY source of per-project configuration.
#                Resolution: candidates, in order —
#                  1. $RICHOS_ENTITY_ROOT   (explicit; also the test affordance)
#                  2. $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR   (host-set; VERIFIED to be the
#                                            session's project dir even when the
#                                            hook's code lives in a plugin
#                                            elsewhere — probe, 2026-08-28)
#                  3. the hook payload's `cwd`
#                  4. $PWD
#                A candidate that is the TOP LEVEL of a working tree is
#                normalised to its MAIN checkout (so a linked worktree resolves
#                to the shared checkout). A candidate that is a SUBDIRECTORY of
#                a repository stands for ITSELF first — normalising it would
#                discard the nesting, which is precisely how an engine at
#                <repo>/engine ends up governing <repo> — and only falls back to
#                its enclosing checkout if it carries no marker of its own.
#                A candidate is ACCEPTED only if it carries the adoption marker.
#
#   ADOPTION MARKER  `orchestration.config` at the root. That file is the one
#                thing an adopter writes to point the engine at their repo, so
#                its presence is exactly the statement "this repository has
#                adopted the engine". Nothing is inferred; adoption is declared.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE GOVERNING RULE — fail LOUD, never skip
# ===========================================================================
# A guard that cannot resolve its root must FAIL LOUD, never silently skip. A
# silent skip is worse than no guard at all, because it buys false confidence.
#
# But "block everything you cannot resolve" is not the same rule, and applying
# it literally would brick every session in every directory on the machine that
# has not adopted the engine — the plugin is enabled at USER scope, so it loads
# in EVERY project. So the resolver distinguishes two cases that the old code
# could not even ask about, and they get different treatment:
#
#   NOT-ADOPTED  No candidate carries the marker. The engine is loaded but this
#                repository never adopted it. There is no protection to lose,
#                because there was never any here. Guards STAND DOWN — and the
#                stand-down is ANNOUNCED, every session, by engine-status.sh,
#                into the orchestrator's own context. Never silent.
#
#   BROKEN       Someone declared a root (RICHOS_ENTITY_ROOT) that is not an
#                engine root, or a governed root is missing an asset the guard
#                needs to do its job. The guard believes it is governing
#                something and cannot. This BLOCKS (exit 2) in every blocking
#                hook and SCREAMS in every non-blocking one.
#
# The distinction the old code could not draw is exactly "not applicable" vs
# "applicable but broken". Every silent skip this contract replaces was the
# second case wearing the first case's clothes.
#
# ===========================================================================
# STATUS IS ALWAYS OBSERVABLE
# ===========================================================================
# After resolve_entity_root, these are set for the caller:
#
#   RICHOS_ENTITY_ROOT_RESOLVED  the root itself (empty unless rc 0)
#   RICHOS_ROOT_STATUS   governed | engine-self | not-adopted | broken
#   RICHOS_ROOT_SOURCE   which candidate won (env-override|project-dir|payload-cwd|pwd|engine-self)
#   RICHOS_ROOT_TRIED    tab-separated list of candidates actually examined
#   RICHOS_ROOT_REASON   human-readable explanation when status != governed
#
# `engine-self` is the engine developing itself: no candidate carried the
# marker, but the ENGINE_ROOT does and it sits at or under the first candidate.
# It is a legitimate configuration (open a session at the repo that contains
# the engine) and it is REPORTED AS ITS OWN STATUS rather than being quietly
# folded into `governed`, because it is the one case where the guards act on a
# root that is not the session's own project dir.

# Prints the path of the LIVE agent definition backing a (possibly namespaced)
# subagent_type, or nothing.
#
#   rc 0  found; path on stdout
#   rc 1  not namespaced and not found  — legitimate for host built-ins
#         (general-purpose, Explore, ...), which have no definition file at all.
#         Callers keep their existing "undeterminable -> accept" behaviour.
#   rc 2  NAMESPACED and not found — the caller must FAIL LOUD. A namespaced
#         type is by construction supplied by a plugin, so its definition MUST
#         be locatable; if it is not, any check that depends on it is silently
#         degrading, which is the failure class this contract exists to kill.

# Search order:
#   1. $ENTITY_ROOT/.claude/agents/<bare>.md            (the entity's own roster)

#                                                        IS this engine's plugin
#                                                        name — read from the
#                                                        manifest, never guessed)
#   3. $AGENT_NAMESPACE_ROOTS                           (orchestration.config:
#                                                        space-separated
