# scripts/lib/stop-hook-notice.sh — THE CHANNEL A Stop HOOK USES TO TELL THE
#                                    OPERATOR IT IS NOT PROTECTING HIM.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE DEFECT THIS FILE REMOVES
# ===========================================================================
# guard-unresolved-claims.sh shipped with three ways to stop enforcing:
#
#     CHECK_UNRESOLVED_CLAIMS=0 in orchestration.config   (stood down)
#     python3 absent from PATH                            (cannot run)
#     guard-unresolved-claims.py missing                  (cannot run)
#
# Each one announced itself on STDERR and exited 0. Its own header says, of the
# first: "Never a silent permission: an opt-out that cannot be seen is a
# defence that decays into a rumour." It then wrote that sentence to a channel
# the operator cannot see, which made it the rumour.
#
# MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED — Claude Code 2.1.251, macOS, 2026-08-30. Three Stop
# hooks were registered in one headless session, each emitting a unique marker
# on a different channel, and the session stream was searched for all three:
#
#   channel                             transcript   operator stream
#   ---------------------------------   ----------   ---------------
#   stderr,  exit 0   (ZACHMARK_STDERR)     yes            NO
#   stdout,  exit 0   (ZACHMARK_PLAINOUT)   yes            NO
#   {"systemMessage":...}, exit 0           yes            YES
#
# The two invisible hooks DID run: the transcript holds a `hook_success`
# attachment for each, with exitCode 0 and a measured durationMs, carrying the
# marker in its `stdout` / `stderr` field. So their absence from the operator's
# scroll is INVISIBILITY, not non-execution — the positive probe that stops
# this table passing for the wrong reason. The third arrived as
# {"type":"system","subtype":"informational","content":"Stop says: <marker>"}.
#
# The same session shows the consequence end to end. With BOTH Stop hooks stood
# down in one adopted sandbox, turn-manifest.sh (which already used
# systemMessage) was announced twice in the operator stream, and
# guard-unresolved-claims.sh (which used stderr) appeared ZERO times — while
# the transcript proves it ran, twice, and stood down, twice.
#
# ONE FURTHER FACT, because the alternative was caution rather than evidence: a
# Stop hook may write systemMessage to stdout AND exit 2. Verified live — the
# turn was still refused (the hook re-fired, which only happens after a block)
# and the systemMessage rendered on the blocking turn as well. So a hook never
# has to choose between announcing and blocking.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHEN IT SPEAKS — the actual design decision
# ===========================================================================
# The requirement is NOT that a running guard is visible. It is that a guard
# which is NOT running cannot be mistaken for one that is. Three candidate
# frequencies, argued from what the operator experiences:
#
#   EVERY TURN — rejected. A stand-down is a persistent, unchanging condition,
#     not an event. Identical text under every turn is text the eye is trained
#     to skip within a dozen turns, and the operator's rational response is to
#     mute it. A muted notice is WORSE than none: the protection is still off
#     and now there is a line on screen that reports it, which nobody reads.
#     That is the CEO's stated failure mode, and it is the one this file must
#     not walk into while fixing the other one.
#
#   ONCE PER SESSION — nearly right, and the half that is right is kept. A
#     session is the unit at which hooks are snapshotted, so it is the unit at
#     which WHAT IS LOADED can change; re-announcing each session means a
#     stand-down cannot decay into a rumour across days.
#
#   ON STATE CHANGE, with "nothing recorded yet this session" counting as a
#     change — CHOSEN. It is the once-per-session rule plus one addition that
#     makes silence mean something precise: EVERY transition is announced,
#     including the transition back to normal. So the operator's last-seen
#     notice for a hook is always its current state, and silence means "still
#     what I last told you" instead of "probably fine". Silence stopped being
#     evidence of health and became evidence of no-change, which is a fact
#     rather than a hope.
#
# A GUARD RUNNING NORMALLY SAYS NOTHING, EVER. The first observation of the
# normal state in a session records itself and prints nothing; only a RECOVERY
# — abnormal, then normal — is worth a line, and it is worth one precisely
# because the operator was told about the abnormal state and is owed the end of
# the story.
#
# NO THRESHOLD ANYWHERE. Whether a guard ran, and down which branch, is read
# off the guard's own control flow. There is nothing to tune, nothing to score,
# and no input on which this can be wrong: the false-positive rate is zero by
# construction, not by measurement.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHEN THE LEDGER CANNOT BE WRITTEN, IT ANNOUNCES EVERY TURN
# ===========================================================================
# De-duplication needs somewhere to remember what it already said. If the
# entity root is unknown or its state directory is unwritable, there is no
# memory — and the fallback is to REPEAT, not to assume it has already been
# said. Degrading toward noise is recoverable by an operator who can read it;
# degrading toward silence rebuilds the defect. This is also why the root-
# resolution failure path, which by definition has no entity root, is the one
# condition that does announce every turn: a guard that cannot tell which
# repository it governs is not a guard, and it is not entitled to be quiet.
#
# ===========================================================================
# ONE PATH IS STILL INVISIBLE, AND IT IS NAMED RATHER THAN GLOSSED
# ===========================================================================
# Every notice a Stop hook raises AFTER its root bootstrap now comes through
# here. One notice is raised BEFORE it: the "BROKEN INSTALL — ENFORCEMENT IS
# NOT ACTIVE" banner a hook prints when scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh itself is
# missing. That one still goes to stderr, so it still reaches nobody.
#
# It was left alone deliberately, not overlooked. That banner lives inside the
# root-resolution bootstrap block, which contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R
# asserts is BYTE-IDENTICAL across all 21 rooted hooks. Changing it in the two
# Stop hooks alone turns Layer R red; changing it correctly means one
# coordinated edit to 21 files on every event, several of which other engineers
# are in right now. That is a different change with a different blast radius,
# and smuggling it in beside this one would be the wrong trade.
#
# What the gap actually costs, stated honestly rather than minimised: if
# resolve-roots.sh is missing then EVERY guard on EVERY event is off, not just
# these two — so the correct fix is engine-wide by nature. It is also the case
# that this helper lives in the same directory as resolve-roots.sh, so an
# install broken enough to lose one has probably lost the other; that path
# needs a fully inline announcement, which is a further reason it belongs in
# the coordinated change rather than here. engine-status.sh announces at
# SessionStart, but it carries the identical bootstrap, so it would be mute in
# exactly this scenario too. NOT VERIFIED EITHER WAY: whether a SessionStart
# hook's stderr reaches the operator's scroll. That was measured for Stop and
# only for Stop; do not assume it transfers.
