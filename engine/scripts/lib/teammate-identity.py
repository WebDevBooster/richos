"""teammate-identity.py — WHAT A TEAMMATE IS CALLED. One answer, both halves.

===========================================================================
THE DEFECT THIS FILE EXISTS TO CLOSE — measured 2026-08-31
===========================================================================
Two in-flight notices were sent, witnessed, and written to
inflight-notices.jsonl at 22:34:43Z and 22:34:49Z with full 40-character
sha_tokens. guard-inflight-notify.sh still reported OWED-NO-NOTICE with
`notified-but-unacked: 0`, and the land was pushed through on two recorded
waivers — which is precisely how a blocking defense decays into a formality.

The cause was visible in the guard's own output. The DEBT side resolved a
teammate from `worker-events.jsonl`, whose every row carries `agent_type` —
the ROLE, `zach`. The WITNESS side recorded `SendMessage`'s `to`, which is
the teammate's MANDATORY UNIQUE NAME, `zach-opus-s1`, because that is the
only thing SendMessage can be addressed with and the very shape
guard-worktree-isolation.sh enforces at spawn time. One half of the engine
wrote `zach`; the other wrote `zach-opus-s1`; nothing could ever join them.

So identity is resolved HERE, once, and both halves import it. A predicate
kept in two copies is the defect class this engine keeps finding in itself,
and "what is this teammate called" had quietly become two of them.

===========================================================================
EXACT JOINS ONLY — AND WHY THERE IS NO ROLE FALLBACK
===========================================================================
Two independent sources, both exact, neither a heuristic:

  1. worker-events.jsonl `WorkerCreated.worker_name`, joined on `agent_id`.
     PostToolUse[Agent] records the spawn's own `name` input alongside the
     agent id extracted from the launch acknowledgement. Cheap, local,
     durable.

  2. The orchestrator's transcript, joined on tool_use_id: the `Agent`
     tool_use carries `input.name`, the matching tool_result carries
     `toolUseResult.agentId`. That join already exists in this engine as
     scripts/lib/agent-liveness.py:names_to_ids and is DELEGATED to, never
     re-implemented. It is the source that works when the PostToolUse[Agent]
     emitter is not registered — which is the live shape on this machine:
     session 374e6f14's worker-events.jsonl holds WorkerStarted rows only.

REFUSED, deliberately: matching a notice's recipient to a worktree by ROLE
PREFIX. `zach-opus-s1` and `zach-opus-n1` share a role, and on the day of
the defect three Zachs were running at once. A role-prefix credit would
report a teammate as told when a DIFFERENT teammate was told — a guard
lying in the direction that lets a land through. guard-agent-state-claims.py
refuses the same fallback for the same reason, and says so in its own
header. When neither exact source resolves, this module returns no name and
NAMES THE SOURCES IT TRIED, so the operator fixes the join instead of
waiving the guard.

===========================================================================
AND WHERE THE RECORD LIVES
===========================================================================
resolve_teams_dir() is here rather than in inflight.py for the same reason:
the witness writes the notice ledger and the guard reads it, and if the two
resolve the session team directory differently the ledger is written to one
path and read from another — the same defect one layer down.
