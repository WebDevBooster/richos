# scripts/lib/unevaluated-notice.sh — THE CHANNEL A PreToolUse GUARD USES TO
#                                     SAY IT NEVER LOOKED AT THE CALL.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE PROPERTY THIS FILE EXISTS FOR
# ===========================================================================
#
#     THE ABSENCE OF A FINDING MUST BE DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE ABSENCE OF A
#     CHECK.
#
# That is this project's most-repeated failure written as a requirement, and it
# is the whole content of this file. Nothing here refuses anything, nothing here
# changes a verdict, and nothing here fires on a call a guard actually read.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT WAS MEASURED (survey, 2026-09-05)
# ===========================================================================
# docs/verification/hook-payload-failure-modes-2026-09-05.md drove all 40
# registered PreToolUse and Stop hooks with an EMPTY payload, a TRUNCATED one
# and one that is not JSON at all. Nineteen of the twenty-five PreToolUse guards
# passed the call, and SEVENTEEN of those did it in complete silence — exit 0,
# nothing on stdout, nothing on stderr, byte-for-byte indistinguishable from a
# guard that looked at the call and approved it. `bash -x` step counts separate
# the two beyond argument: guard-worktree-isolation.sh executes 275 lines when
# it refuses an unisolated spawn and 129 on each degraded payload. It does not
# decide the spawn is safe. It never looks at it.
#
# THE MECHANICAL CAUSE IS ONE LINE, AND IT IS THE SAME LINE IN EVERY GUARD.
# Each one dispatches on the tool name first:
#
#     TOOL_NAME="$(printf '%s' "$INPUT" | python3 -c '...' 2>/dev/null || true)"
#     [ "$TOOL_NAME" = "Agent" ] || exit 0
#
# On an unreadable payload the extraction fails, `|| true` turns that into an
# EMPTY string, and the guard exits at the dispatch line — taking the identical
# exit that a well-formed payload for some OTHER tool takes. "This call is not
# mine" and "I could not tell whose call this is" are collapsed into one silent
# exit 0, which is why most of these guards never even reach their own
# PARSEFAIL branch. This file separates those two again.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE CHANNEL, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED
# ===========================================================================
# scripts/lib/stop-hook-notice.sh carries the equivalent measurement for Stop
# hooks. The same question had never been answered for PreToolUse, so it was
# measured the same way (claude 2.1.261, macOS, 2026-09-05): a sandbox project
# registered ONE PreToolUse[Bash] hook that wrote a unique marker to stderr AND
# a different marker as a stdout {"systemMessage":...}, then exited 0, and one
# headless session was driven through a single Bash call with
# `--output-format stream-json`.
#
#   channel                                  operator stream
#   --------------------------------------   ---------------
#   stderr,  exit 0  (CHANPROBE-STDERR)            NO
#   {"systemMessage":...}, exit 0                  YES
#
# The systemMessage arrived as
#   {"type":"system","subtype":"informational","level":"notice",
#    "content":"PreToolUse:Bash says: CHANPROBE-SYSMSG: predicate not evaluated"}
# and the stderr marker appeared NOWHERE in the stream. The tool call itself ran
# to completion in the same session, which is the positive control: emitting a
# systemMessage with NO `permissionDecision` leaves the verdict exactly where it
# was.
#
# So this file writes BOTH. stderr because it is where a hook's diagnostics
# belong and it survives into the transcript attachment; systemMessage because
# it is the only one of the two that reaches the person who needs to know a
# guard stopped guarding. guard-definition-drift.sh — the guard that already got
# this right in shape — announces on stderr ALONE, so on the operator channel
# its warning has never been heard. Routing it through here is what makes the
# template honest.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY IT SPEAKS EVERY TIME, WHERE THE Stop CHANNEL SPEAKS ON STATE CHANGE
# ===========================================================================
# stop-hook-notice.sh announces a stand-down only when the state CHANGES, and
# argues the case at length: a stand-down is a persistent condition, identical
# text under every turn is text the eye learns to skip, and a muted notice is
# worse than none.
#
# That argument does not transfer, for a reason of kind rather than degree. A
# stood-down Stop hook is ONE condition that persists across many turns. An
# unreadable payload is a PROPERTY OF ONE CALL: this spawn, this write, this
# command was allowed by a guard that never read it. Suppressing the second
# occurrence would not be de-duplicating a condition, it would be declining to
# mention the second unexamined call — which is the defect, one level up.
#
# Held against the real numbers, the noise fear is also hypothetical where the
# silence is measured. Every payload in an ordinary session is well-formed; the
# survey had to CONSTRUCT the degraded ones. A session in which this fires
# repeatedly is a session in which enforcement has systematically stopped, and
# being told that repeatedly is the correct outcome.
#
# There is a durable record as well, for the same reason resume-acks.log and
# definition-drift.log exist: an operator channel is something a person may miss,
# and .claude/state/unevaluated-payloads.log is something a later reader can
# grep. The log line is de-duplicated on CONTENT against the previous line
# (never on the timestamp), the fix already made in guard-definition-drift.sh's
# append_log for double-registered hooks straddling a UTC-second boundary.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
# ===========================================================================
# It does not make any guard fail CLOSED. Which gates are worth the risk of
# bricking a session is a judgment that differs per gate and it has not been
# taken; the survey's recommendation 3 names the candidates and says so. Every
# caller here allows exactly what it allowed before, and that is what makes this
# safe to apply across many guards at once.
#
# It does not bound the read of stdin either. The registered `timeout` in
# hooks/hooks.json is honored by the host — measured three ways on 2026-09-05
# and recorded in docs/verification/unevaluated-payload-notice-2026-09-05.md —
# so a stalled hook is already stopped and its call already proceeds. Bounding
# helps the two guards that genuinely fail closed and no others.
#
# ===========================================================================
# USAGE — one line at the call site
# ===========================================================================

#
# Placed AFTER root resolution (so an unadopted repository still stands down in
# silence — the plugin is enabled at user scope and loads in every project on
# the machine) and BEFORE the tool-name dispatch (so it fires at the line the
# call is actually being lost at). If the payload parses as a JSON object the
# call returns immediately and the guard runs exactly as it did before.

# --- is this payload readable at all? --------------------------------------
# Answers ONE question and refuses to guess at any other: does this text parse
# as a JSON object? Not "does it carry the fields I want" — a payload missing a
# field is a different finding, belongs to the guard that wants the field, and
# is not what the survey measured.
#
# Returns 0 (unreadable) with a one-word reason on stdout, or 1 (readable).
#
# NO python3 IS NOT REPORTED AS UNREADABLE. Without it nothing here can tell a
# good payload from a bad one, and announcing "unreadable" on no evidence would
# be a claim this file cannot support — the exact defect it exists to remove,
# pointed the other way. Guards that need python3 already say so themselves.

# --- the operator half -----------------------------------------------------
# THE SENTENCE IS NOT NEW. guard-ceo-ask-first.sh and guard-ceo-ruled-ask.sh are
# the two PreToolUse guards the survey found already doing this correctly, and
# they say, verbatim:
#
#   "CEO-ASK GATE: could not parse this Agent spawn, so it was not checked and
#    the 'ceo-todos-deferred:' escape hatch could not be read either. This ONE
#    dispatch is ungated."
#
# Label, what was not checked, and the scope of the damage — one call, not the
# session. That grammar is copied here rather than improved on, so all of these
# notices read as one voice and one grep finds every one of them. Those two
# guards are deliberately NOT rewired to this library: they are already right,
# and the derived test below holds them to the same words it holds everyone
# else to, which is a stronger check than making them share an implementation.
#
# The label is DERIVED from the file name rather than passed in. A second name
# for a hook is a second thing to keep in step with the first.
#
# UPPERCASED IN PURE BASH, not with `tr`. This runs in the failure path of a
# guard, which is the last place that should acquire a new dependency on an
# external binary: a PATH without `tr` would have produced a hook that emitted
# `tr: command not found` and a label-less sentence, which is a notice about a
# broken check that is itself visibly broken. bash 3.2 is what /usr/bin/env bash
# resolves to on macOS and it has no ${var^^}, so this is the portable form.
