"""mechanical-findings.py — A DEFECT THE TREE CAN SHOW YOU BECOMES A ROW
                            WITHOUT A PERSON RETYPING IT.

Read scripts/lib/mechanical-findings.sh first; it carries the argument and the
wiring. This file carries the mechanism, because the mechanism has to be exact.

===========================================================================
THE ONE SENTENCE
===========================================================================
    A CHECK THAT CANNOT RUN, A SUITE THAT IS SKIPPED, A HOOK NOBODY TESTS —
    THESE ARE FACTS ABOUT THE TREE. A FACT ABOUT THE TREE IS FOUND BY
    READING THE TREE, AND ONCE FOUND IT IS WRITTEN DOWN WHERE EVERY OTHER
    PIECE OF OPEN WORK IS WRITTEN DOWN, UNDER THE SAME RULES, BY THE SAME
    MACHINE THAT FOUND IT.

On 2026-09-02 an audit found eight real defects in twenty minutes that six
weeks of attention had missed. One of them — the only automated suite over the
"no wrong numbers" data contract, red and skipped in CI since 2026-07-19 — sat
under a comment reading "Tracked separately", tracked in none of the three
queue files. The finding was mechanical. The tracking was a person. The person
is the part that failed, three times: nothing asked for the audit, nothing
turned the finding into a row, and nothing noticed the row was never started.

This file is the middle link. It reads the tree, produces findings with a
stable identity, and appends rows to the working record in the record's own
format — a warrant and all — so the row goes stale, closes and is refused by
exactly the rules every hand-written row already lives under.

===========================================================================
WHAT IS A FINDING HERE — mechanical only, and the boundary is the CEO's
===========================================================================
Every class below is a statement a machine can make about bytes with no
opinion attached. Whether the defect MATTERS, whether the fix is worth doing,
whether the row should be closed as won't-fix — none of that is decided here,
and a class that needed a judgment to fire would be the wrong class.

  ci-excluded-suite   a test file whose basename appears, on a non-comment
                      line of a CI workflow, within a few lines of the word
                      "skip". The 2026-07-19 shape, exactly:
                          if [ "$name" = "client-data-check.test.sh" ]; then
                            echo "SKIP  $t"

  unrun-harness       a *.mutation.sh named on NO non-comment line of any
                      other script or workflow in its repository. The
                      engine's own runner globs *.test.sh, so a harness that
                      no suite invokes by name is run by nobody — seven of
                      thirteen were, on the day this was written, and the
                      comment "that discovery never saw it" sat beside one
                      of the six that were.

  untested-hook       a hook registered in a hook registry (hooks.json or a
                      .claude/settings*.json) that no test file names on a
                      non-comment line — where a file that names half or
                      more of the registered hooks is a registry checker,
                      not a test of this hook, and does not count. That
                      threshold is DERIVED per repository, never typed.

===========================================================================
IDENTITY — the same defect on three runs is one row, not three
===========================================================================
A finding's key is  <class>:<prefix>/<path>  — the class and the subject's
declared-root-relative path, nothing else. It is written INTO the row as
`finding:<key>` where a reader can see what the machine thinks the identity
is, and it is what the next sweep looks for before writing anything. Not a
sidecar ledger: two ledgers written by one writer and read by nobody are how
the 2026-09-02 waiver count reached 251.

A row that already carries the key, in ANY state, is never written again.
Three things follow, and each is REPORTED rather than acted on:

  KNOWN               the row exists and is open. Nothing to do here; the
                      unstarted-row sweep names it every turn until somebody
                      starts it. That is a different hook's job and it
                      already exists.
  GONE                the row exists and is open, and this sweep no longer
                      produces its finding. The defect was fixed, moved, or
                      deleted. The row is NOT touched — closing it means
                      somebody reads the sentence and decides it is true —
                      but it is named, so it does not sit there forever
                      describing a defect that is not there.
  CLOSED-BUT-PRESENT  the row says CLOSED and the sweep still produces the
                      finding. Two statements about one fact disagree; a
                      human resolves it.

A renamed subject is a NEW finding and its old row goes stale through the
warrant — `path`@`oid` no longer exists — which is the row-currency contract
doing precisely what it was built to do.

===========================================================================
WHAT IS NEVER DONE HERE
===========================================================================
  * No existing row is edited, re-stamped, closed or deleted. The record's
    own contract says there is deliberately no re-stamp command, and a writer
    that could touch old rows would be that command wearing a new name.
  * Nothing is written when the record cannot be parsed, when its governed
    section has no table to append to, when a stamp cannot be minted, or
    when another writer holds the lock. Each is reported, never worked
    around.
  * Nothing decides importance. The row says what was seen, where, and that
    a machine wrote it.

===========================================================================
INPUT — one JSON job on argv[1] (or "-" for stdin)

OUTPUT — tab-separated lines on stdout. First line is the verdict:

    CLEAN     <subjects-checked>
    FINDINGS  <total> <new> <known> <gone> <contradictions> <written>
    BROKEN    <reason>

then, in a stable order:

    CLASS   <class>  <subjects-checked>  <findings>        the positive probe
    F       <NEW|KNOWN|GONE|CLOSED-BUT-PRESENT>  <key>  <row-id or ->  <sentence>
    WROTE   <row-id>  <key>  <line-number>
    EXEMPT  <key>  <declared reason>                       honored, never silent
    SKIP    <key>  <reason>                                could not pin, etc.
    NOTE    <text>

EXIT  0 always, unless the job itself is unreadable (2). The verdict is the
      product; a non-zero exit would make "there are findings" and "the sweep
      is broken" the same signal to every caller.
