# scripts/lib/ceo-asks.sh — "HE WAS ASKED" AS A WITNESSED FACT.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE DEFECT THIS FILE EXISTS FOR
# ===========================================================================
# On 2026-08-31 a session ended having prepared two decisions for the CEO. The
# next session opened, he asked "what's next", and the orchestrator answered
# with a backlog report and dispatched an engineer. The prepared questions were
# never put to him. He had to ask three times — the last in capitals — before
# his own question reached him.
#
# EVERY GUARD WAS GREEN THROUGHOUT. ceo-todos-lint.sh passed. row-currency-lint.sh
# passed. The commit guards passed. The record was perfect. Nobody had been
# asked anything.
#
# That is a REPEAT, one level up. scripts/cold-open.sh exists for the same
# defect one level down, and its header is the best statement of it in this
# codebase: "A CEO-facing surface was built, gated, tested and landed, and the
# person it was for could not find it. The record was correct. The lint was
# green." Cold-open made his TODOs FINDABLE.
#
#   FINDABLE IS PASSIVE. NOTHING IN THIS ENGINE MAKES HIM GET ASKED.
#
# Every mechanism here verifies the RECORD. None of them verifies the
# CONVERSATION. This file is the missing half, and it is built on exactly one
# idea, borrowed wholesale from guard-inflight-notify.sh and its PostToolUse
# witness, which solved the structurally identical problem one event over:
#
#   AN OBLIGATION A MESSAGE CAN CLAIM TO HAVE DISCHARGED IS MADE REAL BY
#   WITNESSING THE ACTUAL TOOL CALL.
#
# There, the obligation was "tell the teammate main moved" and the witness is
# PostToolUse[SendMessage]. Here the obligation is "put a prepared decision to
# the CEO" and the witness is PostToolUse[AskUserQuestion]. The only way to
# produce the record is to genuinely call the tool. Asserting that you asked
# produces nothing.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE FOUR PIECES, AND WHY THE BLOCK IS AT THE Agent EVENT
# ===========================================================================
#   scripts/hooks/notice-ceo-asks.sh    PostToolUse[AskUserQuestion] — the
#                                       witness. Names WHICH item was asked,
#                                       from the words he actually saw.
#   scripts/hooks/guard-ceo-ask-first.sh  PreToolUse[Agent] — BLOCKS a teammate
#                                       dispatch while nothing has been asked.
#   scripts/hooks/notice-ceo-unasked.sh Stop — a turn does not end quietly with
#                                       a prepared item this session never
#                                       surfaced.
#   scripts/hooks/session-start-ceo-ask.sh  SessionStart — opens with the top
#                                       item AS A QUESTION.
#
# THE CHOKEPOINT IS DELIBERATE. Dispatching a teammate is the exact act that
# beat the ask on 2026-08-31: he asked "what's next", and what happened next was
# an engineer being spawned. MOTION IS WHAT WINS, so motion is what gets
# blocked. Candidates that were rejected, written down so nobody re-derives it:
#
#   Stop (block the turn)   — NO. A turn that ends BECAUSE he interrupted, or
#     to answer him, is a turn ending correctly; refusing those is how a guard
#     becomes something to switch off. The Stop event carries the NOTICE
#     instead, which is the honest use of it.
#   Every Bash call         — NO. Reading a file is not the act that beat the
#     ask, and a gate that fires on everything is a gate nobody can work behind.
#   SendMessage             — NO. It is the follow-up to a dispatch, not the
#     dispatch; blocking it strands teammates already running.
#
# ===========================================================================
# FAIL-OPEN vs FAIL-CLOSED — the deliberate choice, and its reasoning
# ===========================================================================
# THREE STATES, not two, and the middle one is the whole argument:
#
#   NOT-DECLARED — no CEO_TODOS_REPOS in orchestration.config, and the governed
#     repository itself carries no `.ceo-todos`. There is no CEO queue here.
#     STAND DOWN, silently. This mirrors resolve-roots.sh's `not-adopted`
#     exactly: the engine is loaded at USER scope and runs in every directory on
#     the machine, and a repository that never declared a CEO queue has no
#     protection to lose. It is also the one place this file DIVERGES from the
#     brief it was built to, and the divergence is stated rather than smuggled:
#     the brief asked for a loud notice on an "absent" queue. A notice in every
#     unadopted directory on the machine is precisely the noise this engine
#     already decided not to make (see stop-hook-notice.sh, "EVERY TURN —
#     rejected"), and it would be attached to the case that carries no risk at
#     all. So loudness is spent on the case below, which is the one that can
#     actually hide a failure.
#
#   BROKEN — a queue IS declared and cannot be read: the repository is not on
#     this machine, it carries no declaration, its record is missing, the parse
#     failed, python3 is absent. FAIL OPEN, LOUDLY, on every channel available
#     to the hook. Open, because a guard that wedges every dispatch over its own
#     plumbing gets switched off within a day, and a switched-off guard protects
#     nothing forever. Loud, because "declared and unreadable" is the exact
#     shape of a defense that reports 'on' while protecting nothing — the
#     condition resolve-roots.sh calls BROKEN and treats as the serious one.
#
#   DECLARED AND READABLE, holding prepared items — FAIL CLOSED. The gate has a
#     real subject, it can name it, and the escape hatch below costs one line.
#
# THE ESCAPE HATCH IS A LIVE PROMPT LINE, in the house idiom of
# guard-worktree-isolation.sh's `main-checkout-run:` and guard-resume-isolation
# .sh's `resume-ack:`:
#
#     ceo-queue-deferred: <reason>
#
# in the Agent spawn prompt. It permits that one dispatch and appends to
# .claude/state/ceo-queue-defers.log. When the CEO says "get on with it",
# nothing wedges — and the fact that he said it is on the record.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THIS CANNOT DO — named, not implied
# ===========================================================================
#  1. IT CANNOT JUDGE THE QUESTION. A question that matches item 1.1 may still
#     be a poor rendering of it. No text predicate can tell those apart, and one
#     that claimed to would become a score to optimize instead of a fact. What
#     is engineered out is a session where he was never asked AT ALL.
#  2. IT CANNOT STOP FABRICATION. Anyone with Bash can append a line to the
#     ledger. The failure being engineered out is FORGETTING; fabrication is a
#     different act and no hook in this engine claims to stop it. (Stated in
#     these words by notice-inflight-sends.sh, and true here for the same
#     reason.)
#  3. IT CANNOT MAKE HIM ANSWER. The obligation discharged is the ASK.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE LEDGER
# ===========================================================================
#     <entity root>/.claude/state/ceo-asks.jsonl
#
# One JSON line per question actually put to the user, written by the witness
# inside the orchestrator's own tool call. Keyed on session_id, because the rule
# is per-session: a question asked yesterday did not reach the person who opened
# a session today. It lives in the governed repository's state directory — the
# same place main-checkout-runs.log, resume-acks.log and the other opt-out
# ledgers live — rather than in the session team directory, because the guard,
# the notice and the session-start announcement all resolve that root the same
# way and can therefore never look in three different places for one fact.
