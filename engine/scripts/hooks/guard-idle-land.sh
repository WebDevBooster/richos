# guard-idle-land.sh — BLOCKING Stop hook. Refuses to let a turn end when work
# was COMPLETED, nothing further was STARTED, and nothing is OWED TO THE CEO.
#
# THE FAILURE, PRECISELY
#   The orchestrator's working record opens by stating its own rule: a land
#   ends by STARTING the top unblocked item, then reports — not the other way
#   round; the only permitted stop is an item whose next action needs a
#   decision only the CEO can make. That rule was written by the orchestrator.
#   The orchestrator then landed four branches across two repositories, wrote a
#   long report, and ended the turn with an empty dispatch queue and seven
#   unblocked rows still in the file. The operator had to ask "why has
#   everything stopped again" — for the seventh time in two days.
#
#   Every previous answer to that question was a document. This engine has
#   cataloged the same defect a dozen times in a week under one sentence:
#
#       A RULE ENFORCED BY ATTENTION LASTS EXACTLY AS LONG AS THE ATTENTION.
#
#   So the answer here is the answer everywhere else in this engine — a
#   chokepoint that fires whether or not anybody remembers it. Stop is the
#   chokepoint, and guard-unresolved-claims.sh already established, against the
#   shipping binary rather than against documentation, that Stop can block, that
#   the payload carries `transcript_path` / `prompt_id` / `stop_hook_active` /
#   `background_tasks`, and that the turn's tool traffic is readable there.
#   This hook is built on that finding and follows all of its conventions.
#
# WHY THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS FILE DID NOT HOLD — read this before editing
#   It shipped on 2026-08-30, blocking, measured. On 2026-09-01 the operator
#   reported the same failure twice in one day. Its own observation record says
#   why, over 107 landing turns on this machine:
#
#       dispatched (correctly silent)     60
#       background-running (STOOD DOWN)   44     <- 41% of every landing turn
#       backlog-empty (correctly silent)   2
#       block                              1
#
#   Old term 4 stood the gate down whenever `background_tasks` held anything
#   running — and that field is the host's whole task registry: teammates,
#   subagents, shells, monitors, workflows, scans. This orchestrator keeps ten
#   to fifteen teammates alive at all times, so the gate was off almost whenever
#   it mattered. And old term 1 read only one of the two ways work completes
#   here, missing every turn that answers a FINISHED TEAMMATE with a list.
#
# THE PREDICATE — four terms, all four required, none of them read from prose
#   1. this turn COMPLETED something  a `git merge`/`git push` in the turn's own
#                                     tool traffic whose EFFECT is confirmed
#                                     against the repository by identity, OR a
#                                     host-written `<task-notification>` in this
#                                     turn saying an agent finished
#   2. nothing was STARTED            no `Agent` call and no BACKGROUNDED tool
#                                     call this turn, scoped to promptId
#   3. nothing is OWED TO THE CEO     no `AskUserQuestion` this turn, and no
#                                     hold or end-of-day in his own words
#   4. there IS something to start    an unblocked row DERIVED from the record's
#                                     `## Next` table — never a typed count.
#                                     This is also what answers "a teammate is
#                                     still running": the legitimate stop is
#                                     "running AND the next step depends on it",
#                                     and dependency is what `Blocked by` says.
#
#   The derivation, the conservatism rules and the honest list of what none of
#   this can see are in the module docstring of guard-idle-land.py, which is the
#   analysis half. READ THAT FILE; this one is the wiring.
#
# MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS TRUSTED — 1,082 real orchestrator turns, six sessions
#   Replayed by rebuilding each turn's Stop payload against the transcript AS IT
#   STOOD at that turn, and running this hook against the real repositories.
#
#     305  turns ran a `git merge` or `git push` at all
#     276  of those were CONFIRMED by identity (the merged tip is an ancestor of
#          HEAD, or HEAD equals the remote-tracking ref)
#      29  ran the command and were NOT confirmed. That is term 1's identity
#          check earning its place on its own: 29 turns where the message could
#          have said "landed" and the repository did not agree.
#
#   Of the 276 confirmed landings:
#      95  dispatched an Agent in the same turn        -> silent, correct
#     101  still had an agent running                  -> silent, correct
#       0  were held by the operator                   -> the hold suppressor
#                                                         never fired once; it
#                                                         is a backstop that
#                                                         term 4 usually beats
#      80  landed, started nothing, nothing running    -> BLOCKED  (29%)
#
#   TERM 4 IS DECISIVE AND IS NOT RECONSTRUCTABLE. `background_tasks` comes
#   from the payload — ground truth at run time — and a transcript does not
#   record it. So the replay BRACKETED it, and the bracket is wide enough to be
#   worth stating rather than hiding:
#     presume every agent whose completion notice is missing is still running
#       (over-suppresses; notices are lost, agents get shut down)   ->  10 blocks
#     presume nothing is ever running (never suppresses)            -> 174 blocks
#     count an agent as running only if it demonstrably notified
#       later in the session — the tightest retrospective answer    ->  80 blocks
#   80 is the figure above and the one to argue with.
#
#   READ BY HAND: 14 of the 80. THE MECHANICAL TERMS WERE CORRECT IN ALL 14 —
#   every one really landed, really called no Agent, really had a derivable
#   unblocked row. ZERO cases where the gate misread ground truth.
#     11  the target failure exactly: land, report, stop, and the operator's
#         next message opens a new topic or asks what is next. One of them is
#         literally "yes, clean up the stale richos worktrees. what's next?"
#      3  ended by putting a decision or a click to the operator. Correct BY THE
#         RULE — those rows belong in the CEO's record — but they are the ones
#         that will feel like friction until the deferral route is used.
#
# WHY IT SHIPS BLOCKING AT A 29% FIRE RATE, WHICH IS THE OBVIOUS OBJECTION
#   Because the cost is bounded at ONE EXTRA TURN, structurally. `stop_hook_active`
#   is true on the re-fire, and this gate stands itself down on it — so it can
#   refuse a given turn AT MOST ONCE. The worst case is not a wedged session or a
#   retry storm; it is one more assistant turn, in which the answer is either to
#   dispatch the row or to move it. Both are things that should have happened.
#   And 29% is not the gate being noisy: it is the failure rate the operator has
#   been reporting out loud for two days, now with a number on it.
#
#   IDLE_LAND_ENFORCE=0 in orchestration.config runs it report-only, for an
#   adopter whose record has a different shape and who wants their own numbers
#   before arming it. That key is committed and diffable, like every other
#   stand-down in this engine.
#
# THE ESCAPE IS A DECLARATION, AND A DECLARATION IS NOT A TOKEN
#   This header used to read "NO LIVE OVERRIDE TOKEN", on the argument that an
#   in-the-moment override gets reached for at exactly the moment the gate is
#   working. That argument is RIGHT ABOUT TOKENS and it is why the escape is not
#   one. A flag is free, so it gets typed reflexively; a declaration names WHICH
#   of the three legitimate stops applies and WHY, in a sentence, in the reply
#   the CEO reads — and this wrapper puts that sentence in front of him through
#   `systemMessage` every single time one is used:
#
#       stop-declared: <case> — <why, in a full sentence>
#
#       nothing-unblocked     everything unblocked is genuinely done
#       ceo-owns-it           he stopped this, or his answer IS the deliverable
#       waiting-on-teammate   a teammate is running and the next step needs it
#
#   Six words and thirty characters of reason, minimum. A BARE MARKER EXEMPTS
#   NOTHING — the same discipline `dialect-exempt:` and `main-checkout-run:`
#   already carry in this engine. Moving the row into the CEO's record remains
#   the better escape and is still what the refusal recommends first, because it
#   is committed and diffable; the standing-down key below is in
#   `orchestration.config`, which is also committed and also diffable.
#
# FAIL-OPEN, LIKE ITS SIBLING AND FOR ITS REASON
#   Every other blocking guard in this engine fails CLOSED. The two Stop guards
#   do not. A PreToolUse guard that fails closed refuses one tool call; a Stop
#   guard that fails closed refuses to let the SESSION END, re-firing on every
#   retry until the binary's block cap gives up while the operator watches a
#   wedged session. So a broken install, an unparseable payload, a missing
#   python3, an unreadable or unparsable record — all let the turn end, and the
#   ones worth knowing about SAY SO on stderr rather than dying quietly.
#
# WHEN IT TAKES EFFECT
#   Hooks snapshot at session start. Installing this changes nothing in the
#   session that installs it; it begins enforcing in the NEXT session.
#
# Exit codes (Claude Code Stop convention):
#   0  completed nothing, started something, owed the CEO an answer, declared
#      the stop, nothing to start, not evaluable, or anything went wrong
#   2  BLOCKED — work completed, nothing started, nothing owed to the CEO, and
#      the record has an unblocked row
