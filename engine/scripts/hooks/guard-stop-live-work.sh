# guard-stop-live-work.sh — BLOCKING PreToolUse guard on the TaskStop tool.
#
# ONE RULE: DESTROYING A LIVE TEAMMATE'S WORK REQUIRES THE CEO'S OWN WORDS OR A
# WRITTEN, CHECKABLE REASON.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE FAILURE, 2026-09-10
# ===========================================================================
# He wrote: "the currently running agents MIGHT need to be paused IF we get
# close to hitting the quota before it resets." Within a minute the
# orchestrator called TaskStop on two mid-flight teammates and reported it back
# as compliance. No burn rate had been measured; no condition had been
# established; nothing had been asked.
#
# `echo-opus-hw2` had no commits and a clean worktree. Its entire session is
# gone. `zach-opus-dor1` survived only because it had committed as it went.
#
# "Did I say anything about stopping???"
#
# Fourth instance in one day of one mechanism — an inference about what he
# wanted, substituted for what he said, then acted on expensively. The sharpest
# of the four, because it is the only one whose cost cannot be undone.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE CONTRACT
# ===========================================================================
# The predicate, the corpus measurement and the argument for every clause live
# in scripts/lib/stop-live-work.py and NOWHERE ELSE. Read that first; this file
# is the wiring and the refusal. In one paragraph:
#
#   ALLOW, SILENTLY   the target is not provably running (a finished teammate
#                     being retired -- the overwhelming majority of real
#                     TaskStop traffic), or the caller IS the target.
#   ALLOW             the last genuine user message carries an unconditional,
#                     non-negated, non-interrogative stop imperative.
#   ALLOW + record    a live, targeted, unconsumed stop-work-ack.
#   ALLOW + NOTE      liveness is INDETERMINATE. Said out loud, never guessed.
#   BLOCK             a PROVABLY LIVE target, no instruction, nothing written.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY BLOCKING, AND THE NUMBERS THAT DECIDED IT
# ===========================================================================
# Measured against every real TaskStop call in every Claude Code transcript on
# this machine -- 2,499 transcripts scanned, 100 real calls found, adjudicated
# one by one in scripts/hooks/stop-live-work.corpus.md.
#
#   100  real TaskStop calls
#    94  target NOT provably live at the call, or the CEO had not spoken
#         -> of these, the great majority are the legitimate dominant use:
#            retiring a teammate that had already handed off. Those reach
#            authority A and the guard never speaks.
#     6  carried the CEO's own unconditional stop order -> authority B allows,
#        and it fires on exactly those six and on nothing else.
#     2  are today's kills. Both are refused.
#
#   FALSE POSITIVES ON THE MEASURED CORPUS: 0.
#
# The clause that makes that number 0 is the liveness gate, not the language
# predicate. This guard refuses only on a POSITIVE ALIVE verdict from
# scripts/lib/agent-liveness.py, whose authoritative source is the worktree
# lock. A finished teammate has no lock, so every cleanup passes untouched and
# a habit of waiving never gets a chance to form. That is the g11/g12/g13
# lesson applied at the design stage instead of learned again: this project
# killed three guards in one day by shipping gates broad enough that waiving
# became routine, and a habitually waived guard is a dead guard that still
# looks alive.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT IT NEVER TOUCHES
# ===========================================================================
#   * A teammate stopping ITSELF. The caller's own agent id is compared against
#     the target, by id and by resolved name.
#   * A protocol shutdown. Those are SendMessage bodies; no TaskStop is made.
#   * Cleanup of an agent that has already finished -> not alive -> allowed.
#   * Any other tool. A well-formed payload for anything but TaskStop exits 0.
#
# ===========================================================================
# FAIL-OPEN, AND WHY THAT IS RIGHT HERE SPECIFICALLY
# ===========================================================================
# Its PreToolUse siblings fail CLOSED, and this one does not. The asymmetry is
# deliberate. A fail-closed guard on a destructive tool sounds correct until
# you count the traffic: the dominant legitimate use of TaskStop is retiring
# something already finished, and for those the resolver often cannot resolve
# anything at all. Fail closed and every cleanup needs paperwork. Paperwork
# every time is exactly how the three dead guards died.
#
# So a missing python3, an unparseable payload, an unresolvable root, a broken
# resolver -- all pass the call through, and the ones worth knowing about say
# so on the operator channel. The guard refuses only what it can PROVE is live,
# which is precisely the case that cost a session's work this morning.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHEN IT TAKES EFFECT
# ===========================================================================
# Hooks snapshot at session start, and this is a NEW registration. Installing
# it changes nothing in the session that installs it; it begins enforcing in
# the NEXT session. (An already-registered hook's BODY is re-read each fire --
# this one is not that case.)
