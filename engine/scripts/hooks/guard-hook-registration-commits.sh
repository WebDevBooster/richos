# guard-hook-registration-commits.sh — BLOCKING PreToolUse guard on the Bash tool.
#
# Makes the HOOK REGISTRATION COMPLETENESS contract fire at `git commit` and at
# `git push`, at the moment the registration is written, instead of on `main`
# after the land.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
# ===========================================================================
# On 2026-09-14 CI went red on FIVE units at once, on `main`, all of it
# self-inflicted by the same night's landings. Three hooks landed within two
# hours. Each was correctly registered in hooks/hooks.json. Each was missing
# from a DIFFERENT subset of the other inventories that other suites assert
# against — by-reference BR2, hook-staleness case 11, engine-status case 1b,
# ci-affected-units A5. THREE ENGINEERS HIT IT INDEPENDENTLY THE SAME NIGHT.
# The record is type X, §10h of
# richos-hq/docs/verification/lifecycle-failure-record-2026-09-13.md.
#
# The reason competent people kept getting it wrong is the whole design brief:
#
#   THE REGISTRATION WORKS THE MOMENT hooks.json HAS IT. The hook loads, fires,
#   does its job. NOTHING IS BROKEN FROM THE AUTHOR'S SEAT. The inventories are
#   assertions OTHER suites make about a set the author never sees, and the only
#   thing that says so is CI, after the land.
#
# The record's own conclusion names where the fix has to sit: "the check has to
# fire WHEN THE REGISTRATION IS WRITTEN, not when CI runs." That is here. Its
# sibling guard-completeness-commits.sh states the principle this is another
# instance of:
#
#   A CHECK THAT RUNS WHEN SOMEONE REMEMBERS IS A RULE ENFORCED BY ATTENTION,
#   AND ATTENTION IS THE THING THIS ENGINE KEEPS PROVING IT CANNOT BUY.
#
# THE PREDICATE IS NOT HERE. It is scripts/hook-registration-completeness.sh,
# for its sibling's reason: ONE PREDICATE, MANY CALLERS. That file explains the
# whole decision — why the inventory list is DERIVED by unanimity rather than
# typed, why README.md and install.sh are measured NOT to be inventories, which
# two inventories are conditional and what makes demanding them unconditionally
# worse than having no guard at all. This file decides only WHEN to ask.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY THIS ONE BLOCKS, WHEN SO MANY SHOULD NOT
# ===========================================================================
# Three blocking guards were proposed and rejected in this project in one
# afternoon, and the rejection was right each time: each rested on a predicate
# that had to read INTENT out of prose, so each had a false-positive class, so
# the fix on the day would always have been to waive — and habitual waiving is
# how a guard dies while still looking installed.
#
# This predicate is of a different kind, and that is the entire argument:
#
#   A BASENAME IS IN A FILE OR IT IS NOT.
#
# No inference about what the author meant, no prose to parse, no threshold.
# The one place judgment could have crept in — WHICH files are inventories —
# is removed by deriving them: a file that names every one of the other 68
# registered hooks is an inventory of registered hooks, and the next candidate
# below that line sits 27 hits away. Measured, not assumed; see the predicate's
# header for the table.
#
# The cost of being wrong is also asymmetric in the direction that favors
# blocking. A false refusal costs one edit that was owed anyway. A miss costs a
# red `main`, and that is not hypothetical here — it is what happened, five
# times in one night, to three people who were each being careful.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHERE IT FIRES, AND WHY BOTH ARMS
# ===========================================================================
# COMMIT is where the registration is AUTHORED, and it is the arm the failure
# record asks for. Baseline: HEAD. The subjects are the hooks registered in the
# about-to-exist tree and not in HEAD — so the refusal arrives while the author
# is still holding the change, and it never fires again once the complete
# commit exists.
#
# PUSH is the arm that can see a MERGE. `git merge` creates a commit without
# running `git commit`, so the commit arm never sees one — and a land is a
# merge, which is EXACTLY how the five reds reached `main`. Baseline there is
# the upstream (`@{u}`), so a merge that brings a branch's incomplete
# registration into a pushable state is judged against what the remote already
# has, rather than against a HEAD that now contains the registration and would
# therefore report nothing.
#
# WHEN THE UPSTREAM CANNOT BE RESOLVED the push arm falls back to HEAD, which
# finds nothing new, and IT SAYS SO on stderr rather than passing in silence. A
# gate that could not look and is quiet is indistinguishable from a green one.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE ESCAPE HATCH, AND WHY THIS GUARD HAS ONE WHEN ITS SIBLING DOES NOT
# ===========================================================================
# guard-completeness-commits.sh refuses to have a live override, correctly: what
# failed there was in-the-moment judgment about whether a claim was backed, and
# an in-prompt token would rebuild exactly that.
#
# Here there is a REAL case that no amount of care can edit away, and the probe
# itself has written it down. From contract-integrity-probe.sh's R2/R3 comment:
# zach-opus-hk1 landed notice-unlanded-branches.sh and "correctly did NOT add it
# here, THIS FILE BEING SOMEONE ELSE'S" — another agent held the probe open on
# another branch. "It went in with the merge." A blocking guard with no hatch
# would have forced a blind cross-edit into a file a second agent was rewriting,
# and this project's own rule for that is that a blind cross-edit is how two
# correct fixes become one broken merge.
#
# So: `hook-inventory-ack: <which inventory is owed, who holds it, when it is
# paid>` on the command line, where a reviewer sees the claim beside the act it
# excuses. A BARE MARKER EXEMPTS NOTHING — a reason under 20 characters is
# refused. Every accepted ack is appended to
# ~/.claude/state/hook-inventory-acks.log and the count is printed back, so a
# hatch that has become a habit says so out loud.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT IT COSTS — MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED
# ===========================================================================
# richos @ f5babcb7, 68 registered hook scripts, 674 tracked files in engine/,
# best of 9, macOS 24.6.0:
#
#   not a commit or a push (the cheap door)                      44 ms
#   a commit in a repository with no engine (stand-down)         87 ms
#   a commit in richos, nothing newly registered                142 ms
#     of which the predicate alone is                            68 ms
#   a commit in richos, ONE incomplete registration             146 ms
#   guard-completeness-commits.sh, same tree, for comparison    672 ms
#
# THE COST IS FLAT IN THE SIZE OF THE DIFF AND NEARLY FLAT IN THE SIZE OF THE
# TREE, and that is a property of the derivation rather than luck: the
# inventory candidates come from ONE `git grep` for a single peer name (22 ms
# on this tree, 12 files), and only those files are read in full. Nothing walks
# the repository.
#
# COST DISCIPLINE, so this stays true on a tree ten times the size: past
# HOOKREG_SOFT_BUDGET_S the guard says so on stderr EVEN WHEN IT PASSES. Past
# the hooks.json timeout the host KILLS the hook, and a killed hook is a SILENT
# one — which is the defect this file exists to remove, so the advisory fires
# at a fraction of the timeout rather than at it.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THIS CANNOT CATCH
# ===========================================================================
# Everything scripts/hook-registration-completeness.sh cannot catch, unchanged
# — that list lives in ONE place, in that file's header (removals, Layer M's
# CANON, README's table, an inventory's first hook), and is not copied here.
# Add the three this chokepoint contributes:
#
#   * A commit or push from a session this engine does not govern, or from
#     outside any session at all. Same hole every hook in this family has.
#   * A merge that is never pushed. The land sequence pushes, so this is
#     covered in practice and not in principle.
#   * A push whose upstream does not resolve. Reported, not silent; see above.
#
# PRECISION: fires only on a command that actually contains `git commit` or
# `git push`, and only in a repository that carries an engine (hooks/hooks.json
# beside scripts/lib/registered-hooks.sh). Every other repository on this
# machine is untouched at the cost of a substring test and two file tests.

# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
