# verify-agent-prompt.sh — PreToolUse gate on Agent spawns.
#
# Six always-on checks plus one OPT-IN check (the QA install-fresh gate,
# toggled by ENABLE_QA_INSTALL_FRESH_GATE in orchestration.config — OFF by
# default):
#
#   1. duplicate-teammate        — reject spawning a name that already exists
#                                  (not shutdown) in the session team. The
#                                  session team is derived from the hook
#                                  input's session_id when team_name is absent.
#   2. agent-not-found           — every in-repo `.claude/agents/<name>.md`
#                                  referenced in the prompt must exist. Skipped
#                                  for the creator meta-role (CREATOR_TEAMMATE,
#                                  whose job is to create the file);
#                                  out-of-repo absolute references are never
#                                  evaluated.
#   3. subagent-as-spawner       — reject prompts that ask a subagent to spawn
#                                  or dispatch agents; only the orchestrator
#                                  spawns.
#   4. missing-worktree-isolation— prompt claims native isolation created the
#                                  worktree but the call didn't set
#                                  isolation:"worktree".
#   5. qa-install-fresh (OPT-IN) — prompts that test/audit/render/capture the
#                                  local app must cite an install-fresh script
#                                  as a precondition, or carry an auditable
#                                  `data-contract-bypass:` line. Part of the
#                                  advanced "identity-or-refuse" tier; enable
#                                  only if you adopt a device/install-fresh
#                                  pipeline (see reference/advanced-tier/).
#   6. ack-contract-missing      — a spawn that gets a worktree must carry the
#                                  in-flight ack contract in its PROMPT (the
#                                  helper name OR the ack path), or an auditable
#                                  `no-inflight-ack:` line. The instruction
#                                  cannot travel in the message it exists to
#                                  make verifiable.
#   7. concealment-clause        — reject a brief that orders anyone to reduce
#                                  WHAT THE CEO SEES (hide it from him, keep it
#                                  off his screen, make it invisible to him)
#                                  instead of removing the condition that makes
#                                  him see it. Auditable `conceal-ack:` line for
#                                  the rare true case; a bare marker exempts
#                                  nothing. Measured against 1,871 real spawn
#                                  prompts — see scripts/hooks/conceal.corpus.md.

# 6. ack-contract-missing — a file-writing spawn must be TOLD how to acknowledge
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# You cannot bootstrap reliability from an unreliable channel. If the
# instruction "here is how you acknowledge" travels in the follow-up message,
# it is lost with the message it rode in on — and the lead is then left waiting
# for an ack the teammate was never told to write. That is not hypothetical: on
# 2026-08-30 the lead sent two receipt checks to a teammate and sat waiting for
# replies that never came, having never told it how to reply durably.
#
# So the ack contract belongs in the SPAWN PROMPT, which is one of the four
# substrates the doctrine calls durable, and this is the chokepoint where every
# spawn prompt passes exactly once.
#
# WHO IT APPLIES TO: spawns that get a worktree — native isolation, or a
# hand-rolled worktree named in the prompt. Those are the teammates who can be
# left behind by a land, because they are the ones holding a snapshot. A
# read-only or synchronous subagent holds nothing and is owed nothing.
#
# HOW TO SATISFY IT: name either the helper (`inflight-ack.sh`) or the ack path
# (`inflight-acks/`) in the prompt. One line:
#
#   If I message you saying main moved, acknowledge it durably — I cannot rely
#   on a reply reaching me. Run: scripts/inflight-ack.sh --sha <sha> --impact
#   <conflict|stale-record|grew-scope|none> --detail "<your own words>"
#   --paths "<paths or none>"
#
# BOTH FORMS ARE ACCEPTED because the FORMAT is the contract, not the script.
# The engine is loaded by reference, so `scripts/inflight-ack.sh` is not a path
# that exists inside the governed repository — a teammate reaches the helper at
# ~/.claude/richos-engine/scripts/inflight-ack.sh, and only if the operator has
# installed it. A prompt that spells out the ack FILE instead
# (<worktree>/.claude/inflight-acks/<sha12>.<teammate>.ack and its keys) has satisfied
# the requirement completely, and a check that insisted on the script name would
# be refusing the more robust of the two.
#
# HOW TO OPT OUT: a live prompt line starting  no-inflight-ack: <reason>
# Auditable, visible in the prompt itself, and never silent — the same shape as
# main-checkout-run: and data-contract-bypass:.

# 7. concealment-clause — a brief may not order anyone to reduce WHAT THE CEO
#    SEES in place of fixing what makes him see it
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is one sentence of history rather than a principle.
# On 2026-09-10 a brief left this orchestrator carrying the instruction
#
#     Make the surviving demand invisible to him.
#
# A guard was firing a warning at the CEO. The warning was TRUE. The brief did
# not ask anyone to remove the condition that made it fire; it asked for the
# warning to be carried on a channel he could not read. He found it himself —
# he reads the tool calls — and said: "That is hiding, not fixing." He then
# asked the only question that matters about a promise: how does he know it
# will never happen again.
#
# A note-to-self is not an answer to that question. This check is.
#
# WHAT IT REFUSES: a suppression verb whose GRAMMATICAL TARGET is the CEO or a
# surface he reads. Not a suppression verb. Not the word "hide". The pairing,
# in one sentence, with the CEO on the receiving end of a directional
# preposition:  hide X FROM HIM, keep X OFF HIS SCREEN, make X INVISIBLE TO
# THE CEO, stop HIM FROM SEEING X, so HE NEVER SEES X, strip X FROM every
# USER-VISIBLE field, route X AWAY FROM HIS SCREEN.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE PRECISION/RECALL TRADE, CHOSEN AGAINST A MEASURED CORPUS
# ===========================================================================
# THIS PROJECT HAS KILLED THREE BLOCKING GUARDS BY BUILDING THEM TOO BROAD
# (g11/g12/g13, all in one day). The fix on the day is always to waive, and
# habitual waiving is how a guard dies. So the shape below was not reasoned
# out and shipped — it was measured against every Agent spawn prompt in every
# Claude Code transcript on this machine, 1,871 unique real briefs, and the
# first two drafts were thrown away because the corpus said they were wrong.
#
#   draft 1  verb and CEO anywhere in one sentence   16 hits, 15 of them false
#   draft 3  verb GOVERNING the CEO (this one)        1 hit, and it is the
#                                                      2026-09-10 brief itself
#
# The whole measurement, every cut shape, and the command to reproduce it:
# scripts/hooks/conceal.corpus.md.
#
# CHOSEN DELIBERATELY IN FAVOR OF PRECISION — what this does NOT catch:
#   * Anything inside a code fence, an inline code span, a blockquote, an HTML
#     comment, or a QUOTED span. Every brief that describes this incident
#     quotes it, and a guard that refuses briefs about itself is a guard that
#     cannot be worked on. Cost: an order written entirely inside quotation
#     marks is missed. Nobody writes an order that way; somebody evading this
#     check would. It guards honest drift, not an adversary.
#   * A sentence carrying a PROHIBITION or a contrast ("do not hide it from
#     him", "concealing it from him INSTEAD OF fixing it", "nothing here may
#     keep it off his screen"). Matching a prohibition as an order is the
#     exact defect that broke the sibling brief gate hours after it landed
#     (femcboost 34d23cf6d). Bare "never" is deliberately NOT a prohibition
#     marker, because "so he never sees it" is the canonical concealment
#     phrasing — only "never again"/"never happen" are.
#   * Indirection with no directional object: "carry the repair instruction on
#     a channel that reaches the MODEL and not the user", "put the full
#     instruction where only the model reads it". Both are from the original
#     brief and both are missed. Catching them needs intent, not grammar, and
#     every draft that tried cost more false positives than it bought.
#   * Suppression aimed at ANY OTHER audience — an app user, a coach, an
#     athlete, a log, a test. That is ordinary product work, it is frequent,
#     and a gate that ate it would be waived within a week. 18 such briefs are
#     pinned as must-allow cases in verify-agent-prompt.test.sh.
#
# THE ESCAPE HATCH IS REAL, because unlike the interactive-prompt guard this
# one CAN be right to refuse and wrong to insist: a live credential, PII, or a
# secret genuinely should not reach a screen. `conceal-ack: <reason>` on a live
# prompt line, logged to .claude/state/conceal-acks.log. A bare marker exempts
# nothing — the reason must say something.
