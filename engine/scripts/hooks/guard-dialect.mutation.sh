# guard-dialect.mutation.sh — PROVES THE DIALECT SUITE CAN FAIL.
#
# 71 green ticks are evidence of nothing until somebody shows them turning red
# for the right reason — and this guard has a specific way of being useless
# while looking healthy. A word list that quietly stops matching, an exemption
# widened by one character, a `exit 2` that became `exit 0`: every one of those
# leaves the hook wired, hash-matched, present, executable and PASSING, over
# zero enforcement. That is exactly the shape of the defect this guard was
# built for — the 2026-08-30 sweep reported success and constrained nothing.
#
# So: take the SHIPPED source, remove ONE property at a time, and assert that
#   1. guard-dialect.test.sh FAILS,
#   2. the SPECIFIC named case fails — not merely "something went red", and
#   3. the mutation actually applied (a replacement that matched nothing gives
#      a green run that looks like a green run, which is the same trap again).
#
# Every mutant is a throwaway copy of the engine subtree. Nothing here touches
# the real tree.
#
# Run directly: scripts/hooks/guard-dialect.mutation.sh
# Exit 0 = every property is proven load-bearing.
