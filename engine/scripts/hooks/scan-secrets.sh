# scan-secrets.sh — PreToolUse guard (Write|Edit|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit).
#
# Closes the "will these autonomous agents leak my credentials into a commit?"
# objection — a top-three security question from any CEO evaluating an
# autonomous-agent team. Scans the CONTENT a Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit
# tool call is about to introduce for secret-shaped strings, and BLOCKS the
# write before it ever reaches disk — structurally, not by promise. This is
# the same "catch it at the moment of the write" posture as
# guard-main-checkout-writes.sh; it is wired as a SECOND hook under that same
# PreToolUse[Write|Edit|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit] matcher (see
# .claude/settings.local.json), not a separate git pre-commit hook — the engine
# has zero git-hook infrastructure today, and this slots into the existing
# Claude-Code-hook framework with no new installation mechanism, per the
# roadmap's own "no new infrastructure" constraint.
#
# WHAT IT CATCHES (two independent detector classes):
#
#   1. Vendor-prefix patterns — high-confidence because the prefix already
#      narrows the false-positive space enormously: AWS access keys
#      (AKIA/ASIA...), GitHub tokens (ghp_/gho_/ghu_/ghs_/ghr_/github_pat_...),
#      OpenAI keys (sk-.../sk-proj-...), Anthropic keys (sk-ant-...), Stripe
#      LIVE keys (sk_live_/pk_live_/rk_live_ — test-mode sk_test_/pk_test_
#      keys are deliberately NOT flagged, matching common practice for
#      non-production fixtures), and PEM private-key blocks
#      (-----BEGIN ... PRIVATE KEY-----).
#   2. Generic key=value literals — password=/passwd=/pwd=/api_key=/secret=/
#      token=/access_key=/private_key=, gated by Shannon entropy of the value
#      (real secrets are pseudo-random; placeholders are not) so a fixture
#      like `api_key = "re_xxxxxxxxx"` does NOT false-positive: a run of a
#      single repeated character has ~0 bits/char of entropy, far below the
#      real-secret threshold, so no allowlist entry is even required for that
#      specific shape — the entropy gate handles it structurally. Additional,
#      explicit exemptions: known placeholder words (placeholder, changeme,
#      example, dummy, redacted, ...), environment-variable-reference syntax
#      (${VAR}, process.env.X, os.environ[...], os.getenv(...) — the CORRECT
#      way to handle a real secret, never itself a leak), and
#      SECRET_SCAN_ALLOWLIST in orchestration.config (space-separated literal
#      substrings an adopter can add for their own known-safe fixtures).
#
# Findings are NEVER echoed in full in the block message — only a redacted
# preview (first few / last few characters) — so the block message itself
# never becomes a second place the secret leaks (terminal scrollback, CI
# logs).
#
# FAIL-CLOSED on a missing python3 (matches every other hook this session's
# audit hardened). FAILS OPEN (passes through, exit 0) on a malformed/
# unparseable JSON payload — matching guard-main-checkout-writes.sh's own
# convention for this same Write|Edit matcher class (a payload that can't be
# understood isn't itself a threat to react to; Agent-spawn guards fail
# closed on unparseable payloads because spawns are the harder security
# boundary — this hook follows its Write/Edit sibling's convention instead).
