# notice-unasked-deferral.sh — NON-BLOCKING Stop hook. A TURN DOES NOT END
#                              QUIETLY WHILE IT ANNOUNCES A DEFERRAL THE CEO
#                              WAS NEVER GIVEN THE CHANCE TO CHOOSE.
#
# The predicate, the corpus, the precision number, the constructions that were
# refused and WHY are in guard-unasked-deferral.py. Read that first — it is the
# analysis half. This file is the wiring and the one sentence.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE RULE
# ===========================================================================
# A turn whose text DEFERS WORK must be paired with one of:
#   1. an AskUserQuestion in the same turn putting the deferral to him, or
#   2. an explicit CEO instruction to defer, already on the record, or
#   3. an Agent spawn in the same turn that actually starts the deferred thing.
# Otherwise this notice names the deferral, quotes the construction it matched,
# and says plainly that a deferral the CEO did not choose is a decision taken on
# his behalf.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY IT REPORTS AND DOES NOT BLOCK
# ===========================================================================
# By the time this fires the harm has already happened — the decision was taken
# and announced inside the text the operator is about to read. Blocking cannot
# unsay it. What blocking WOULD do is refuse to let a turn end over a regex on
# PROSE, re-firing to the binary's block cap while the operator watches a wedged
# session, and the first thing a wedged session earns is CHECK_UNASKED_DEFERRAL=0.
#
# That is the exact failure mode that produced this defect: a mechanism that is
# switched off protects nothing forever. The value here is that the CEO sees the
# deferral NAMED in the same turn, instead of having to ask a third time. Same
# trade as notice-ceo-unasked.sh, notice-unstarted-rows.sh and
# notice-inflight-acks.sh, for the same reason.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT IT CANNOT DO, SAID HERE RATHER THAN ENGINEERED AROUND
# ===========================================================================
# THE ORCHESTRATOR CAN PHRASE AROUND ANY WORD LIST, and this one is six patterns
# wide. It catches the NATURAL PHRASING OF AN UNNOTICED HABIT — which is the
# actual failure mode; the specimen was written with no awareness that it was
# taking a decision that belonged to the CEO. It does not and cannot catch
# deliberate evasion. Claiming otherwise would make it a checkbox, and this
# engine's cold open is explicit about what a checkbox is worth.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHEN IT TAKES EFFECT
# ===========================================================================
# Hooks snapshot at session start. Installing this changes NOTHING in the
# session that installs it — it begins reporting in the NEXT session. Verify it
# is live after a restart with:  scripts/hooks/notice-unasked-deferral.sh --self-test
# and by checking the engine-status banner's registered-hook count.
#
# ONE LINE, STATE-CHANGE DE-DUPLICATED, through scripts/lib/stop-hook-notice.sh
# — the only channel measured to reach the operator (that file carries the
# measurement table; on exit 0 the host shows him neither stdout nor stderr).
# The state key is the construction plus a hash of the quote, so a second
# DIFFERENT deferral speaks again and a re-report of the same one does not.
#
# Exit codes: always 0. This hook never refuses a turn.

# "ok", every next turn "ok" replaces the finding key, and BOTH of them see a
# changed state and speak. The same deferral was announced on every single turn
# — de-duplication defeated by the hook that owns it.

# guard-unresolved-claims.sh announces up front and is right to: its finding

# THE THREE OUTCOMES, AND WHY THERE USED TO BE TWO
# ===========================================================================
# 3 means a deferral fired. 0 means the turn's text was READ and is clean. 4
# means the predicate was NOT EVALUATED, with a one-word reason on stdout.
#
# 4 was added on 2026-09-05 because this wrapper made an affirmatively FALSE
# statement, and it is the only one found anywhere in the forty-hook payload
# survey. Given a payload carrying no `last_assistant_message`, the analyzer
# returned 0 — its code for "nothing fired" — and this wrapper announced:
#
#     "DEFERRAL WATCH — RUNNING AGAIN. This turn's text was checked for work
#      postponed without putting the choice to you."
#
# It was not checked. There was no turn text to check. The reassurance was
# decoupled from the check, which is a green tick over nothing, in the guard
# whose entire subject is decisions taken quietly on the CEO's behalf.
#
# A crash in the analyzer is treated the same way and for the same reason: this
# hook's premise is that missing one deferral is cheaper than being switched
# off, so an analyzer that died still ends the turn — but it ends it SAYING SO,
# not claiming to have looked.
#
# The healthy-and-clean path stays silent. stop_notice_normal speaks only when
# the previous state was one of the stand-downs above, so an operator who was
# told this guard was off is told when it comes back.
