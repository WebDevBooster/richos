# worker-updated-handoff.sh — PostToolUse[SendMessage] hook. LOG-ONLY; never blocks.
#
# The "{name} updated" signal (UX design §7.1's timeline verb, §7.2's "latest
# authored update"). Appends one JSON line per update a WORKER authored, to the
# same durable stream the other three lifecycle emitters write:
#
#   -> <team dir>/worker-events.jsonl   (fallback: ~/.claude/worker-events.jsonl)
#
# Full stream contract + the per-state observability table:
#   docs/worker-lifecycle-events.md
#
# WHY THIS IS A REAL SIGNAL AND NOT A MAILBOX READ. The orchestration doctrine
# is explicit that the teammate->lead mailbox is lossy and that no load-bearing
# signal may depend on it. This hook does not read the mailbox. It observes the
# SEND ITSELF, in the sending worker's own execution, at the moment the tool
# call resolves — so it witnesses the update even in the cases where delivery
# is dropped. The event is "a worker authored an update", which is true
# independently of whether anyone received it.
#
# WHY PostToolUse AND NOT PreToolUse. Same reasoning as the creation hook, and
# it matters twice over here: PreToolUse[SendMessage] is where the BLOCKING
# resume-isolation guard lives, and a message that guard refuses is a message
# that was never sent. Sourcing this from PreToolUse would log updates that
# never happened, and would put a logger inside a blocking chain for no reason.
# PostToolUse fires only for a send that actually went through.
#
# ATTRIBUTION IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. Every hook payload carries agent_id ONLY
# when the hook fired from inside a subagent. That single field is what
# separates the two kinds of SendMessage:
#
#   * agent_id PRESENT  -> a worker sent this. That is an update, and it is
#                          attributable to exactly that worker. Logged.
#   * agent_id ABSENT   -> the lead sent this (the main thread). "Messaged
#                          {name}" is an orchestrator action, not a worker
#                          state. NOT logged.
#
# There is no fallback, no cwd-sniffing, no name matching. An update that
# cannot be attributed by identity is not written, because a misattributed
# update is a lie about which worker said what, and that is worse than a
# missing row.
#
# CONTENT IS NEVER LOGGED. Only the SendMessage tool's own short `summary`
# field (already a designed-for-display recap) is recorded, truncated, plus the
# message's character count. The message body never enters this log: it can
# carry anything, including credentials, and an evidence log that quietly
# accumulates model output is a privacy defect waiting to happen. A consumer
# that needs the text reads the transcript under its own rules.
#
# NEVER BLOCKS, ALWAYS EXIT 0. Env override for tests: WORKER_EVENTS_TEAMS_DIR.
