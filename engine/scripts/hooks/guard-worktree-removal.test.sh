# guard-worktree-removal.test.sh — regression tests for the worktree-removal
# guard, scripts/hooks/guard-worktree-removal.sh (PreToolUse[Bash], blocking).
# Under docs/plans/worktree-spec-2026-09-11.md the only deleters are a land and
# a discard (scripts/workspaces.sh); the guard refuses, with no override, every
# raw command that creates or deletes what only those events may (S* below).
#
# GUARD coverage (classification / precision):
#   (a)  raw git worktree remove                  -> exit 2 (block)
#   (a2) git -C <repo> worktree remove (x-repo)   -> exit 2 (block)
#   (b)  git worktree prune (all forms)              -> exit 2 (block)
#   (c)  git branch -d/-D of a worktree-* branch  -> exit 2 (block)
#   (d)  rm -rf a .claude/worktrees/agent-* path  -> exit 2 (block)
#   (d2) rm -rf a REAL linked worktree top level  -> exit 2 (block)
#   (e)  workspaces.sh invocation                 -> exit 0 (allow)
#   S1-S9 the spec's own refusals, no override: git worktree add, a real
#        agent workspace (cc/, worktree-*) removed by hand, codex/ touched,
#        claude --worktree                        -> exit 2 even with an ack
#   (f)  worktree-remove-ack: override            -> exit 0 (allow) + one log line
#   NO FALSE FIRE:
#   (g)  git worktree list / non-worktree branch -D / rm -rf of an
#        ordinary dir / non-Bash tool / ordinary reads / garbage payload
#   (g7) *** `git rm -r <dir>` is NOT a filesystem removal ***  -> exit 0
#   (g8) *** a plain directory merely NAMED `*-wt` ***          -> exit 0
#   (g9) *** the MAIN checkout of a repo (not a linked worktree) *** -> exit 0
#   RO1-RO10 *** a READ never fires, even beside another verb's -d ***  -> exit 0
#   RO11 a raw `git worktree add` is NOT a read: refused (points 1, 3)   -> exit 2
#   RD1-RD8  *** ...and every destructive shape still blocks ***        -> exit 2
#   PR1-PR8  *** prose that DESCRIBES a removal is not one ***          -> exit 0
#   PX1-PX8  *** ...and text the shell WILL run still blocks ***        -> exit 2
#   (h)  block message names workspaces.sh, the spec's refusal and the ack
#   (i)  missing python3                          -> exit 2 (fail-closed)
#   (j)  unadopted repository                     -> exit 0 (stand down)
#   (k)  DECLARED-but-unadopted root              -> exit 2 (broken, not stand-down)
#
# g7/g8/g9 are the three cases the pre-move copy got WRONG, and they are the
# reason this guard was rewritten rather than copied. g7 blocked a legitimate
# `git rm -r scripts/hooks` during the previous migration step; g8/g9 are the
# `*-wt` naming heuristic replaced by a structural linked-worktree test.
#
# The removal HELPER this suite used to exercise (remove-agent-worktree.sh and
# its ENTITY-lock liveness rules, H1-H7) is deleted: under the spec a workspace
# is deleted by a land or a discard and by nothing else, and those are proven
# by scripts/lib/workspaces.test.sh.
#
# registry-write-exempt: every `workspaces.sh land|discard|status` string in this
# file is PAYLOAD handed to the guard under test, never executed, so this suite
# touches no workspace registry at all and needs no RICHOS_WORKSPACES_DIR. The
# declaration exists because land-completeness.test.sh's L21 reads source and
# cannot tell a command that runs from a command quoted as test data.
#
# Run directly: scripts/hooks/guard-worktree-removal.test.sh
# Exit 0 = all pass; exit 1 = at least one failure.

# --- RG1-RG10: WHO records the integration branch (point 14; round 7) --------
# Both round-6 reviewers found nothing checked WHO wrote the record: the party

# `git branch -f dev/workspace-spec HEAD`, and every retirement was RETIRED —
# and the same move retargets where every in-flight agent's work lands. In an
# AGENT's call (the payload carries its agent id) both are refused, the way
# `claude -w` is; the lead's own calls pass, and an agent moving a branch nobody
# recorded passes (precision). Rule 6b asks the library which branches are

# --- ROUND 8, items 2 and 3: every DELETER and every MOVER of a codex/ ref, every
# verb that NAMES the recorded branch, and the checkout doorway ------------------
# brief-audit-frank-round8 §2–§3, executed in a fixture: five deleters passed the
# guard and deleted a codex/ branch at rc=0 (update-ref -d, push --delete, push
# :codex/x, push :refs/heads/codex/x, branch -M away); nine movers rewrote one;
# eight verbs that name the recorded branch moved it (branch -C, push HEAD:heads/<it>,
# fetch, pull, checkout -B, switch -C, symbolic-ref, send-pack); and a plain
# `checkout <it>` opened a class where commit/reset/merge/rebase move it unnamed.
# A DELETER of a codex/ ref is refused from ANYONE's call (S7's rule, widened);
# a WRITER or MOVER, and any work inside a codex/ workspace, is refused from an
# AGENT's call; the lead's writes pass; reads and copies cut FROM codex/ pass.
