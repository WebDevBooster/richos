# ceo-inputs.test.sh — THE INGRESS, END TO END, IN SANDBOX REPOSITORIES,
#                      DRIVEN THROUGH THE SHIPPED HOOKS AND THE SHIPPED GATES.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT IS ASSERTED, AND WHY EACH SECTION EXISTS
# ===========================================================================
#   A. IT COMMITS. The specimen — a message handing over an untracked file —
#      ends with that file IN GIT, unmodified, in a commit of its own. This
#      section runs FIRST, because every silence assertion below is worthless
#      if the mechanism is simply broken and silent about everything.
#   B. IT DOES NOT TOUCH ANYBODY ELSE'S WORK. Staged work is not swept into
#      his commit, the working tree is not written, and `git status` does not
#      afterwards report his file as a staged deletion.
#   C. IT IS SILENT ON EVERYTHING ELSE. Tracked files, ignored files, bare
#      words, prose containing slashes. Each silence is paired with the
#      specimen firing in the same run, so a silence is provably a decision
#      rather than a hook that never ran.
#   D. THE GATES REFUSE, AND NOTHING IS COMMITTED WHEN THEY DO. A credential,
#      a path at the repository root, an unadopted repository, an unreadable
#      encoding, a merge in progress, a detached HEAD.
#   E. THE ABSENCE OF A FINDING IS DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE ABSENCE OF A
#      CHECK. Stood down, no analyzer, an unreadable payload — each SAYS so,
#      and a clean run still writes its ledger line.
#   F. IT NEVER BLOCKS. Exit 0 on every path above. Measured against the
#      binary: exit 2 on this event ERASES the message he typed.
#   G. THE CONTENT NEVER LEAVES. A distinctive string inside every specimen
#      file is asserted absent from every byte this hook prints.
#   H. THE TURN-END PARTNER. A refusal is re-announced until the fact behind
#      it ends, and the recovery is announced when it does.
#
# Run directly:  scripts/hooks/ceo-inputs.test.sh [--verbose]
# Exit 0 = all green.
