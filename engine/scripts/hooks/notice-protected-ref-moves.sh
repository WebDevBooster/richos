# notice-protected-ref-moves.sh — NON-BLOCKING Stop hook. A TURN DOES NOT END
#                                  QUIETLY WHILE A PROTECTED BRANCH IS MISSING
#                                  COMMITS IT HAD.
#
# The predicate, and the argument for every rule in it, is in
# scripts/lib/protected-ref-moves.py. Read that first. This file is the wiring
# and the one sentence.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE GAP THIS CLOSES
# ===========================================================================
# On 2026-09-14 the engine's protected-ref check stopped WRITING. It used to
# move `refs/heads/main` back to a tip one agent's window happened to hold, with
# no compare-and-swap and no reflog message; on 2026-09-13/14 that line moved
# main in /Users/alex/ab/richos three times in one night, the second and third
# twelve seconds apart in opposite directions, while the lead was landing. It
# now reports a move and leaves the ref alone.
#
# THE ENGINEER WHO MADE THAT TRADE RAISED IT HIMSELF rather than hiding it:
# *"who reads that notice is not mine to decide."* He was right to. Where the
# notice went, measured rather than assumed:
#
#   * a `protected-ref-moved` row in the store's event log — read by no hook,
#     no script and no gate on this machine (grepped, 2026-09-14);
#   * a row on the agent's own record — surfaced by nothing;
#   * a `=== PROTECTED REF MOVED ... ===` line on the STDERR of
#     observe-created-refs.sh, a PostToolUse hook that exits 0. The measured
#     channel table in scripts/lib/stop-hook-notice.sh is explicit: stderr at
#     exit 0 reaches the transcript and NOT the operator's stream. Worse, that
#     stderr belongs to the session of the agent that made the move — the one
#     party who cannot decide whether the move was allowed.
#
# So an automatic action had been replaced by a notice with no reader, which is
# how a safety mechanism dies quietly. This hook is the reader, and it is the
# lead's: the branch is one only the lead may move (worktree spec point 14), so
# the lead is the person the finding belongs to.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY IT REPORTS AND MUST NOT BLOCK
# ===========================================================================
# The check stopped writing because its inference was wrong: it cannot tell the
# lead's ordinary land from the abuse it hunts, and the land is the most common
# write that branch ever receives. A BLOCKING version of that same inference
# would be the identical defect with a heavier instrument — it would refuse the
# lead's turn on the strength of a guess that has already been measured wrong,
# and the fix on the day would be to waive it, which is how a guard dies.
#
# What this hook announces is NOT that inference. It is one mechanical fact
# asked later, at rest: the tip the branch held when the agent's call started is
# no longer on the branch. Commits are missing. That statement has no threshold
# and no false-positive class, and it still is not grounds to refuse a turn —
# losing a commit on purpose is a thing the lead does (a rewind to drop a bad
# land), so the answer belongs to him and not to a hook.
#
# NO CONFIG KEY AND NO ESCAPE HATCH, for the reason notice-escalations.sh gives:
# an opt-out on the watch over a ref only the lead may move is absurd, and its
# absence is why this notice cannot decay into a rumour. The per-finding
# settlement (`protected-ref-moves.py review --why ...`) is the only way to
# silence one, it is durable, and it carries a reason.
#
# ===========================================================================
# ONE LINE, STATE-CHANGE DE-DUPLICATED — AND IT GETS LOUDER
# ===========================================================================
# systemMessage via scripts/lib/stop-hook-notice.sh, the only channel measured
# to reach the operator. The state key the predicate returns carries the set of
# findings AND an age bucket per finding (1 h / 24 h / 72 h), so a set that
# never changes still crosses rungs; on top of that the announcement recurs
# hourly while it stands, because a control that goes QUIETER as the failure
# persists is the failure shape recorded on 2026-09-10 as type F. The ledger is
# keyed per SESSION, so a new session re-announces everything outstanding — a
# move made while the lead was away is on his screen at the end of his first
# turn, without a second registration on SessionStart.
#
# A HEALED FINDING SAYS NOTHING. The commits coming back — by a merge, a reset,
# anything — closes it with nobody told to close it, and that is the ordinary
# ending. Silence here means "the branches hold what they held", never "nobody
# looked".
#
# NOT SCOPED TO A REPOSITORY, deliberately, and for notice-escalations.sh's
# reason: a session seated in one repository with teammates in worktrees of
# another is the NORMAL shape of this operation, and the real incident was a
# femcboost session's agents moving richos main. It stands down only where the
# engine is not adopted at all.
#
# NOTE: hooks are snapshotted at session start. This one is INERT until the
# next session — it assumes nothing about being live in the session that adds it.
#
# UNEVALUATED-PAYLOAD-EXEMPT: payload-independent — the predicate is the workspace store's event log joined
# against the repositories it names; the payload contributes nothing but the
# session id used to de-duplicate, and a payload it cannot read degrades toward
# announcing MORE often rather than less. This hook already announces when the
# predicate is unavailable — 'PROTECTED REF WATCH IS OFF' and 'PROTECTED REF
# WATCH PRODUCED NOTHING' — which is that same property implemented for a
# different input.
#
# WHY THIS ONE NEEDS A DECLARATION WHERE THE OTHER EXEMPT HOOKS DO NOT.
# scripts/hooks/unevaluated-payload.test.sh derives every registered PreToolUse
# and Stop hook from hooks/hooks.json and drives each with an empty, a truncated
# and a non-JSON payload. A hook that REFUSES them is proven fail-closed by that
# alone; a hook that ANNOUNCES on them is proven audible by that alone; neither
# needs a word in its source. But a hook that is SILENT on all four looks
# identical whether its predicate never needed the payload or its predicate was
# silently lost — which is the whole defect, and it is the one thing driving a
# hook cannot tell you. So payload-independence is the single class that must be
# CLAIMED by a person, and the suite then holds the claim to its consequence:
# the output must be identical on all four payloads. An undeclared silent hook
# fails that suite; a falsely declared one fails it too.
#
# Exit codes: always 0. This hook never refuses a turn.
