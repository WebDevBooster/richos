# guard-vendoring-commits.test.sh — regression tests for
# scripts/hooks/guard-vendoring-commits.sh and its predicate,
# scripts/lib/vendored-material.sh.
#
# Five sections, and the second is the one that decides whether this guard
# survives its first week.
#
#   A. POSITIVES — it refuses an unrecorded vendoring, across the command
#      shapes people actually type (`git commit`, `cd x && git commit`,
#      `git -C x commit`, `--amend`, a MULTI-LINE message), and the refusal
#      NAMES the path, the registry and the line to add.
#   B. NEGATIVES — it does not fire on a recorded addition, a modification, a
#      deletion, an ungoverned path, a dry run, a merge, a push, or a
#      repository that declares nothing. A guard that cries wolf is switched
#      off within a day, and then the rule has no chokepoint again.
#   C. CONFIGURATION AND FAILURE MODES — a malformed registry is fail-closed
#      with a named reason, a malformed payload is fail-open, two copies of the
#      declaration are BROKEN rather than a choice.
#   D. THE SHIPPED REGISTRY ITSELF — it parses, everything it names exists,
#      everything under a governed path is covered, the 2026-09-04 audit's
#      fifteen third-party skills are all in it, and its two qualified
#      confidences are still qualified. A registry that drifted from the tree
#      would leave this guard green over a fiction.
#   E. REGISTRATION — wired on both surfaces, declared in the probe's spec, and
#      exactly ONE parser of the registry exists.
#
# Run directly: scripts/hooks/guard-vendoring-commits.test.sh
# Exit 0 = all cases pass; exit 1 = at least one failure.
