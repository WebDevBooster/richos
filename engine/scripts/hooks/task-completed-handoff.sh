# task-completed-handoff.sh — TaskCompleted hook. Verify committed integration before recording completion.
#
# Appends one JSON line per task completion to the session team directory
# (task-events.jsonl) — durable coordination state for the orchestrator, one
# of the two guaranteed completion signals in the durable-handoff model
# (companion: teammate-idle-handoff.sh -> idle-events.jsonl). A completed task
# is pruned from the queryable task store, so this append-only log + the commit
# are the durable completion record.
#
# A refused proof exits 2 so the native task remains open with remediation.
# Idle and SubagentStop remain observations, not accepted delivery.
# This cooperative hook is not a same-user security or writer-cutoff boundary.
#
# "COULD NOT READ THE MESSAGE" AND "THE WORK IS NOT DELIVERED" ARE DIFFERENT
# FINDINGS, and until this was split the hook gave both the same answer: exit 2,
# task stays open. A lifecycle payload IS a message; the agent<->lead channel is
# measured at roughly 50% loss, and the standing rule is that no load-bearing
# signal may depend on it. An unparseable payload could therefore WEDGE a
# completion -- letting the lossy channel be decisive, which is the exact thing
# that rule forbids -- and it would do so without the gate ever looking at the
# evidence it actually judges, which is the COMMIT.
#
# So the two findings now get two answers:
#
#   unreadable payload        no advisory side effect, a refusal row in the
#                             durable event log so it stays visible, exit 0. It
#                             did not prove delivery; it also did not DISPROVE
#                             it, and only a proof may hold a task open.
#   readable payload whose
#   delivery evidence fails   exit 2. That is the gate doing its job.
#
# The malformed-event check's original intent is kept whole: garbage still
# triggers no ledger row, no receipt and no accepted completion.

# the engine root carries orchestration.config, so the pwd candidate ACCEPTS the
# engine as the governing entity for a task completed in a repository that never
# adopted the engine. The gate then refuses (exit 2) where the contract says it
# must stand down (exit 0), and a task in an unadopted repository can never be
# marked complete. Measured: CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR and the payload cwd both naming
# an unadopted repo still resolved status=governed source=pwd
# root=<engine>, because the caller stood in <engine>.
#

# this substitution one branch further down (it requires the engine root to lie
