# guard-unresolved-claims.test.sh — regression tests for the Stop-time claim
# gate (scripts/hooks/guard-unresolved-claims.sh + .py).
#
# THE TWO REAL FAILURES ARE REPLAYED HERE, STRUCTURALLY, NOT VERBATIM.
#   richos is a public repository, so no operator speech and no transcript text
#   is committed. Every fixture below reproduces the SHAPE of a real failure —
#   an agent name with no spawn, a SHA that names no object, a nameless action
#   claim in a turn with zero Agent calls — with invented content. The
#   measurement that justified each threshold was run against the real
#   transcripts on disk and only the NUMBERS are recorded, in the hook header.
#
# Covers:
#   BLOCKING — agent names (monotonic ground truth: the ledger only grows)
#     (a)  name never spawned, session team dir present     -> exit 2
#     (b)  name present in spawned-names.log                -> exit 0
#     (c)  name present in the roster only                  -> exit 0
#     (d)  name present in an event log only                -> exit 0
#     (e)  name never spawned, session team dir ABSENT      -> exit 0 (inert)
#     (f)  name never spawned but grounded in tool output   -> exit 0
#   BLOCKING — commit SHAs
#     (g)  SHA that resolves in the entity repo             -> exit 0
#     (h)  SHA that names no object anywhere                -> exit 2
#     (i)  dead SHA grounded in this session's tool output  -> exit 0
#   MUST NOT FIRE — the precision cases
#     (j)  UUID fragments, tool-use ids, hex-looking prose  -> exit 0
#     (k)  ratios and labels that look like paths (13/13)   -> exit 0
#     (l)  a path that does not resolve                     -> exit 0 + report
#     (m)  quoting the operator; describing another agent   -> exit 0
#     (n)  a legitimate turn end: a hold, a question, an
#          answer, a named next step awaiting a decision    -> exit 0
#   FAILURE REPLAYS
#     (o)  FAILURE 2, as written: nameless action claim,
#          zero Agent calls                                 -> exit 0 + report
#     (o2) FAILURE 2, named: the same claim naming an agent
#          that was never spawned                           -> exit 2
#     (p)  FAILURE 1: a turn naming the next step without
#          taking it                                        -> exit 0 + report
#     (p2) Agent called INSIDE this turn                    -> exit 0, silent
#     (p3) Agent called only in an EARLIER turn             -> exit 0 + report
#          (p2/p3 are the turn-scoping regression: a session-wide tool view
#           silently disarmed the reporting layer after the first spawn)
#   SAFETY — this gate must never strand a session
#     (q)  stop_hook_active=true, violation present         -> exit 0
#     (r)  repository has not adopted the engine            -> exit 0
