# stop-hook-visibility.test.sh — EVERY Stop HOOK, DERIVED FROM THE REGISTRATION
#                                 SURFACE, CAN BE SEEN GOING QUIET.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
# ===========================================================================
# A Stop hook that stands down, fails open, or cannot run must say so where the
# operator will actually read it. Measured against Claude Code 2.1.251: on a
# zero exit the host files a Stop hook's stdout AND its stderr into the
# transcript as a `hook_success` attachment and renders neither in the
# operator's scroll. The only channel that reaches him is a stdout
# {"systemMessage": "..."}. The measurement, with its positive probe, is in
# scripts/lib/stop-hook-notice.sh.
#
# So this suite exists to stop the next Stop hook from being written the way
# guard-unresolved-claims.sh was: three separate ways to switch itself off,
# each announced on a channel nobody can see, under a header warning that an
# unseeable opt-out "decays into a rumour".
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE SET IS DERIVED, NEVER TYPED
# ===========================================================================
# The inventory of Stop hooks comes from hooks/hooks.json through the one
# shared parser (scripts/lib/registered-hooks.sh), for the reason that file
# documents at length: a TYPED list of 14 where the registration held 15 is the
# defect that opened this whole sequence, and a typed count went stale INSIDE
# the file arguing counts must be derived, hours later. A Stop hook added
# tomorrow is covered by this suite with no edit here.
#
# NEGATIVE CONTROL: the derivation is asserted to have found a NON-ZERO number
# of Stop hooks, and the number is printed. Two mechanisms this session were
# caught reporting green because they read nothing.
#
# ===========================================================================
# RELATIONSHIP TO engine-status.test.sh's COUNT TRIPWIRE
# ===========================================================================
# That suite carries a deliberately hand-typed `REGISTERED_N -eq 27` beside its
# derived fraction, so that adding a guard is something a human has to
# acknowledge rather than absorb. THIS CHANGE DOES NOT MOVE IT, and that is the
# honest outcome rather than an omission: nothing here registers a new hook.
# The notice channel is a LIBRARY that existing Stop hooks source, so
# hooks.json is untouched and the tripwire is untouched. If a later change to
# this area does wire a hook, that line is the one to update — never to silence.
# It also already carries the caveat that the banner's noun is one wide, since
# turn-manifest.sh is counted there and renders rather than guards.
#
# THIS SUITE TYPES NO COUNT OF ITS OWN. It reports the derived number and
# asserts only that it is non-zero and that the two registration surfaces
# agree. A literal here would be a third hand-maintained inventory.
#
# Usage: scripts/hooks/stop-hook-visibility.test.sh

# 1c. THE REGISTRATION TRAP, on both surfaces — EXACTLY ONCE.
#
# The trap is that two "command" KEYS in ONE hook entry is valid JSON and
# silently keeps only the last, which unregisters a guard with no error. The
# check is made against the PARSED structure, where a shadowed key has already
# vanished and shows up as the absence it is: every Stop script must appear
# exactly once, once shadowing has done its worst.
#
# AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS CASE ALSO DEMANDED ONE SCRIPT PER HOOK OBJECT, AND
# THAT WAS WRONG. A single entry's "hooks" ARRAY holding several commands is a
# supported, working shape — PreToolUse[Agent] has used it for four guards all
# along, and it was confirmed live here: turn-manifest.sh and
# notice-hook-staleness.sh share one Stop entry and BOTH fired in a real
# session, each with its own hook_success attachment. Asserting otherwise would
# have flagged two engineers' correct work as a defect, which is a false
# positive in a suite whose whole claim is that it has none. The array is not
# the trap; the duplicate KEY is, and 1d owns that.

# no exceptions and no opt-out. Using this particular helper is NOT the
# requirement, and an earlier version of this section demanded it. That flagged
# notice-hook-staleness.sh, which reached the same design independently
# (`announce_once`, session-scoped, on systemMessage) and passes section 3
# cleanly. Failing a correct hook for not sharing an implementation is enforcing
# style, and a style rule dressed as a safety check is how a suite starts
# producing the false positives it advertises it has none of.
#
# So: the ADOPTERS are named and required to agree with each other, the
# hand-rollers are named so the choice is visible rather than silent, and
# whether either group actually speaks is settled in section 3.
