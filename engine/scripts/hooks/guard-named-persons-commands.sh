# guard-named-persons-commands.sh — BLOCKING PreToolUse guard on the Bash tool.
#
# THE THREE SURFACES THE SCRUB MISSED.
#
# A third party's name reached this public repository in a FILE. That much the
# write guard now covers. The remedy is what makes this file necessary: the
# commit that removed his name from the file PUT HIS FULL NAME AND HIS COMPANY
# IN THE COMMIT MESSAGE — on the repository's commit list, more visible than the
# line it was deleting. It had to be amended and force-pushed with branch
# protection temporarily lifted.
#
#   A SCRUB COVERS FOUR SURFACES: file content, commit message, branch name,
#   and PR/issue title.
#
# guard-named-persons-writes.sh covers the first. This covers the other three,
# because all three are typed into a COMMAND and a PreToolUse[Bash] hook is
# handed that command before it runs.
#
# WHAT IT INSPECTS, AND WHY THE WHOLE STRING
# ------------------------------------------
# The entire command text, not a parsed flag. Flag parsing is where the holes
# are: `-m`, `-m<msg>`, `--message=`, `--title`, `-t`, `-b`, a heredoc body
# inside a command substitution, a second `-m` for a trailer. Every one of those
# is IN the string, so reading the string has no hole to miss. The one thing the
# string does not carry is a message in a FILE (`-F <path>`), and the predicate
# reads that file for exactly this reason.
#
# The cost of reading the whole string is precision, and precision is bought
# back by firing on almost nothing: only a command that CREATES A DURABLE,
# PUBLISHABLE ARTIFACT — `git commit`, `git tag`, `git branch`, `git checkout
# -b`, `git switch -c`, `git worktree add`, `git push`, `git merge`, `git notes`
# and any `gh` subcommand. Ordinary shell work — reading a file, grepping,
# building, running tests — is never inspected, so a private note that mentions
# a real person can still be read, searched and edited on this machine. Nothing
# about this guard makes a name unmentionable; it makes a name unpublishable.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, said here rather than discovered later:
#   * `git commit` with NO message, which opens the editor. The message is typed
#     into a temporary file no hook is handed.
#   * Commits created by `git merge`, `cherry-pick`, `rebase` and `am`, which
#     make commits without running `git commit`. A merge commit's default
#     message quotes the BRANCH NAME, and branch names are gated at creation.
#   * A branch created, or a PR title typed, in the GitHub web UI. No hook on
#     this machine is anywhere near that path. The release-time check is the
#     backstop for everything typed rather than executed.
#
# NO LIVE OVERRIDE, AND NO ALLOWLIST — DELIBERATELY, AND UNLIKE ITS SIBLINGS.
# guard-publication-commits.sh at least has ALLOWLIST, a committed exemption for
# a PATH. There is no path exemption here, because the object being protected is
# a PERSON and not a location: "this name is fine in this directory" is not a
# statement anybody can make on his behalf. The two ways through are to write
# the artifact without the name, or to take the entry off the deny-list — and
# the second is a decision about a person, made in the operator's own file,
# outside every repository.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED on a missing python3 and on a BROKEN list. FAILS OPEN on an
# unparseable payload, matching the Bash-matcher family.

# resolution was wrong the moment the engine became loadable by reference,
# is in scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. This bootstrap block is byte-identical
# in every hook that needs a root; contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R asserts
# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
