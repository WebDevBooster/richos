# dispatch-pretooluse.mutation.sh — EVERY PROPERTY OF THE RUNNER, PROVEN BY
# REMOVING IT.
#
# dispatch-pretooluse.test.sh is 25 green cases, and 25 green cases are evidence
# of nothing until somebody has watched each one go red for the RIGHT reason.
# This harness takes the shipped dispatcher, removes one property at a time in a
# throwaway copy of the engine, and asserts the suite fails AT THE NAMED CASE.
#
# THE MUTANTS THAT MATTER MOST ARE THE SILENCES.
# `missing-module-silent`, `oddrc-silent` and `first-block-wins` do not break a
# refusal — they make the dispatcher report a rule that DID NOT RUN exactly as
# it reports a rule that ran and found nothing. That is the failure this shape
# newly makes possible, it leaves no other symptom, and it is the reason twelve
# guards in one process was a risk worth this much apparatus. A harness that
# only proved the refusals would prove the half that cannot kill us.
#
# `memo-always-on` is here for a different reason: it is the only mutant that
# touches a shared library every other hook in the engine uses. The memo's whole
# safety argument is that it is inert unless one caller asks for it, and an
# argument nobody has watched fail is a hope.
#
# Invoked from dispatch-pretooluse.test.sh, so the runner that discovers
# *.test.sh runs this too. A harness nobody runs proves nothing about anything.
