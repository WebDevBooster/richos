# notice-ceo-ruled-prose.sh — Stop hook. LOG-ONLY; never blocks.
#
# THE HALF OF THE FAILURE THAT NO GATE CAN BLOCK.
#
# The predicate, the corpus measurement and the fail-open argument live in
# scripts/lib/ceo-ruled.sh. Read that first; this file is the wiring.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL, WHEN THERE IS ALREADY A BLOCKING GATE
# ===========================================================================
# guard-ceo-ruled-ask.sh refuses an AskUserQuestion whose subject the record
# has already ruled. It is the right gate on the right event, and on the night
# it was ordered IT WOULD HAVE CAUGHT NONE OF THE THREE FAILURES, because —
# verified against the session transcripts on this machine — ALL THREE WERE
# ASKED IN PROSE:
#
#   22:01  "3. What the customer installs themselves. ... Options: build your
#          Option D, ship the engine inside the app, or v1 is dogfood-only."
#   20:01  "is your mark one color, or does the swoosh get the gold?"
#   19:45  the seven splash screens, restated as approved.
#
# Not one of them was a tool call. There is no PreToolUse event for a sentence
# in a reply, and no hook can block one. A mechanism that shipped only the
# blocking gate would be green over exactly the failure it was built for —
# which is the shape this engine has now caught in itself several times, and
# the one the brief named: a check satisfied by a corpse.
#
# So the prose ask is covered HERE, at the only event that can see it, and the
# cost is stated rather than hidden: THE STOP EVENT FIRES AFTER HE HAS READ THE
# MESSAGE. This notice cannot prevent the question. What it can do is put the
# ruling in front of the orchestrator before the CEO answers, so the next thing
# he sees is "the record already says this, here it is" rather than a second
# question. That is worth having and it is not the same as prevention.
#
# ===========================================================================
# ONLY THE PARAGRAPHS THAT ASK ARE CHECKED — AND THE WINDOW WAS MEASURED
# ===========================================================================
# An assistant turn is long and cites the record constantly; running the
# predicate over a whole reply fires on 26% of asking turns, and a notice that
# fires on one turn in four is a notice nobody reads. Three windows were
# measured over 2,821 real assistant turns on this machine before one was
# chosen; the numbers are beside the extractor below.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH, stated because a notice that overstated its reach
# would be worse than none: the logo question never used the word "logo" (it
# said "your mark"), so no title anchor could reach it; and the splash-screen
# failure was not a question at all — it was an assertion, and nothing that
# looks for an ask can look at an assertion. ONE of the three prose failures is
# caught here. That is the honest number.
#
# NEVER BLOCKS, ALWAYS EXIT 0. A Stop hook that can refuse a turn re-fires to
# the block cap and strands the session, and a notice people have to escape
# from is a notice people remove.

# --- ROOT RESOLUTION -------------------------------------------------------
# TWO ROOTS, NEVER ONE. The full contract, and why the old single-root
# resolution was wrong the moment the engine became loadable by reference,
# is in scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. This bootstrap block is byte-identical
# in every hook that needs a root; contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R asserts
# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
