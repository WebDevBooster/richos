# worker-lifecycle.test.sh — one suite for the four worker-lifecycle emitters
# (worker-created / worker-started / worker-updated / worker-ended), because
# they are one stream and their most important properties are properties OF the
# stream, not of any single hook:
#
#   * a BLOCKED spawn must produce NO event at all — no phantom active worker;
#   * a SYNCHRONOUS Agent run must produce no "created", because its
#     PostToolUse fires when the work is already over;
#   * an unattributable event must produce no line rather than an anonymous one;
#   * created / started / run_ended must land in one file, in order, joinable
#     on agent_id — which is the only way a consumer can compute an active
#     count without guessing;
#   * `run_ended` must never be dressed up as completed / failed / interrupted;
#   * a message BODY must never reach the log;
#   * and none of it may ever fail a tool call.
#
# Every negative case here has a positive control beside it. A test that
# asserts "nothing was written" passes just as well when the hook is broken and
# writes nothing ever, so each one is paired with the almost-identical input
# that MUST write, and the pair is what carries the meaning.
