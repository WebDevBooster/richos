# notice-mechanical-findings.sh — NON-BLOCKING Stop hook. A DEFECT THE TREE
#                                 CAN SHOW YOU IS WRITTEN DOWN AS A ROW, BY
#                                 THE MACHINE THAT FOUND IT, AND THE TURN
#                                 DOES NOT END QUIETLY WHILE IT HAPPENED.
#
# The argument — why the trigger is the turn end, what is and is not a finding,
# how a finding keeps one identity across runs, and what this cannot see — is
# in scripts/lib/mechanical-findings.sh and scripts/lib/mechanical-findings.py.
# Read those first. This file is the wiring: resolve the repository, sweep,
# write the rows, and say the one sentence.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY IT WRITES AND DOES NOT ONLY REPORT
# ===========================================================================
# The standing bar in this engine is that a deliverable which only reports has
# failed unless the report IS the mechanism. Here the report is not the
# mechanism: a finding that is only announced is a finding the lead has to
# retype into the record, and that retyping is the link that was missing on
# 2026-09-02 — "Tracked separately" was a finding that had been announced and
# never written. So this hook APPENDS the row, in the record's own format with
# its own warrant, into the record's working tree. It is then a file on disk
# that the landing guards check, that the unstarted-row sweep names every turn,
# and that the lead lands or deletes on purpose. It is never edited by this
# hook again.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY IT DOES NOT BLOCK
# ===========================================================================
# `Stop` CAN block, and guard-idle-land.sh uses it. This one does not, for the
# reason every notice in this Stop chain gives: its subject is a fact ("a suite
# is skipped in CI"), and "therefore this turn may not end" is a judgment the
# hook does not have. A blocking coverage check is the check that gets waived,
# and the waiver ledgers on this machine held 251 entries on the day this was
# written. The row is the durable artifact; the notice is the doorbell.
#
# ===========================================================================
# ONE LINE, STATE-CHANGE DE-DUPLICATED
# ===========================================================================
# systemMessage via scripts/lib/stop-hook-notice.sh, the only channel measured
# to reach the operator (see that file's table). The state key is the set of
# rows written, rows whose finding is gone, and rows that say CLOSED over a
# finding that is still there. A stable set is announced once; the notice
# speaks again when the set changes. A finding that is KNOWN and open says
# nothing here — notice-unstarted-rows.sh already names it every turn until
# somebody starts it, and two hooks saying one thing is noise.
#
# NOTE: hooks are snapshotted at session start. This one is INERT until the
# next session — it assumes nothing about being live in the session that adds
# it.
#
# UNEVALUATED-PAYLOAD-EXEMPT: payload-independent — the predicate is the repository, not the payload. The survey drove
# it with all four shapes and got byte-identical notices; a degraded payload
# costs it nothing and an announcement would be pure noise.
#
# WHY THIS ONE NEEDS A DECLARATION WHERE THE OTHER EXEMPT HOOKS DO NOT.
# scripts/hooks/unevaluated-payload.test.sh derives every registered PreToolUse
# and Stop hook from hooks/hooks.json and drives each with an empty, a truncated
# and a non-JSON payload. A hook that REFUSES them is proven fail-closed by that
# alone; a hook that ANNOUNCES on them is proven audible by that alone; neither
# needs a word in its source. But a hook that is SILENT on all four looks
# identical whether its predicate never needed the payload or its predicate was
# silently lost — which is the whole defect, and it is the one thing driving a
# hook cannot tell you. So payload-independence is the single class that must be
# CLAIMED by a person, and the suite then holds the claim to its consequence:
# the output must be identical on all four payloads. An undeclared silent hook
# fails that suite; a falsely declared one fails it too.

# --- ROOT RESOLUTION -------------------------------------------------------
# TWO ROOTS, NEVER ONE. The full contract, and why the old single-root
# resolution was wrong the moment the engine became loadable by reference,
# is in scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. This bootstrap block is byte-identical
# in every hook that needs a root; contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R asserts
# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
