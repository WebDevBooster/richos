# guard-workflow-ban.sh — BLOCKING PreToolUse guard on the `Workflow` tool.
#
# WHAT IT BLOCKS
#   Every invocation of the `Workflow` orchestration tool, in a repository that
#   has adopted the engine, unconditionally. There is no allow-list, no live
#   escape line, and no ack mechanism: if the tool call reaches this hook in an
#   adopted repository it is refused, period.
#
# WHY
#   The `/workflow` orchestration tool has failed in production sessions and
#   wasted an operator's time. The framing that put this guard here: memory
#   cannot be relied on — a hook is the only thing an operator can rely on. A
#   doctrine line in CLAUDE.md or a memory entry is advisory and degrades
#   silently; a blocking PreToolUse hook is structural and cannot be forgotten,
#   re-read wrong, or summarised away. Orchestration happens exclusively via
#   individual `Agent` dispatches.
#
# DEFAULT-ON, OPT-OUT EXPLICIT
#   BAN_WORKFLOW_TOOL in the governed repository's orchestration.config:
#     unset / 1  -> BAN ACTIVE   (the default, so the ban can never be lost by
#                                 an adopter forgetting to opt in)
#     0          -> stood down, and it SAYS SO on stderr the moment a Workflow
#                   call arrives — never a silent permission
#   A ban that defaults off is a ban that disappears the first time somebody
#   adopts the engine and does not read this file. So it defaults on, and the
#   only way to turn it off is to write the word down in the entity's config,
#   where a reviewer sees it.
#
# WHERE IT DOES NOT APPLY
#   A repository that never adopted the engine. The plugin is enabled at USER
#   scope and therefore loads in every project on the machine; the root contract
#   (scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh §"not-adopted") says a guard stands down where
#   it was never invited, and this guard is not a special case. `broken`, by
#   contrast, blocks — a guard that believes it is governing something and
#   cannot resolve it must never guess.
#
# DESIGN — DELIBERATELY MINIMAL
#   Past the root resolution every rooted hook shares, the block depends on
#   NOTHING: no state files, no registry or roster reads, no network, no git, no
#   python3. The only payload field it reads is the tool name, and only so it
#   can prove it never over-blocks a different tool (self-test case b). Fewer
#   moving parts = fewer ways for the ban to fail open.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED: if the payload's tool name cannot be determined, the call is
# BLOCKED. This hook is wired under the `Workflow` matcher only, so an
# unparseable payload arriving here is a Workflow call by construction — and a
# ban that guesses "probably fine" is not a ban.
#
# Exit codes (Claude Code PreToolUse convention):
#   0  not a Workflow call, or this repository has not adopted the engine, or
#      the entity opted out explicitly — passes through untouched
#   2  BLOCKED
#
# Self-test:  scripts/hooks/guard-workflow-ban.sh --self-test
