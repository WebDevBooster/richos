# guard-definition-drift.sh — BLOCKING PreToolUse guard on the `Agent` tool.
# Closes the "a mid-session definition install never reaches the spawned
# agent's booted prompt" hole.
#
# THE FAILURE MODE (proven upstream 2026-08-06, 25 rejected deliverables):
#   `.claude/agents/*.md` teammate definitions are loaded ONCE, at SESSION
#   START — exactly like hooks. Install or update a definition mid-session and
#   the file on disk changes, the roster line changes, everyone's mental model
#   changes — but a teammate spawned later in that SAME session still boots on
#   the STALE definition the harness read at session start. Nothing in the
#   spawn payload, the tool result, or the agent's own transcript says so. In
#   the upstream production project this engine was extracted from, a teammate's
#   definition was upgraded (v2.0 -> v2.1) and the work dispatched in the very
#   same session: batch 1 happened to notice its booted prompt was v2.0-shaped
#   and self-corrected; batches 2-4 did not, drafted 25 outputs under the stale
#   v2.0 contract, and every one had to be thrown away. That project's incident
#   write-up does not ship with this engine — the lesson does.
#   The "How to Delegate" section of your CLAUDE.md states the rule; this guard
#   is the structure that makes forgetting it impossible.
#
# THE CONTRACT
#   Partner hook: scripts/hooks/snapshot-agent-definitions.sh (SessionStart)
#   records `sha256  <path>` for every definition at session start into
#   .claude/state/agent-definitions-<session8>.snapshot. At every Agent spawn
#   this guard compares that recorded hash against the CURRENT on-disk hash of
#   the definition being spawned:
#
#     MODIFIED (hashes differ)   -> BLOCK. The booted prompt is provably the
#                                   pre-edit definition. Message names both
#                                   hashes and the two sanctioned paths.
#     ACKED    (definition-drift-ack: <sha256> in the prompt, matching the
#               CURRENT on-disk hash)
#                                -> ALLOW + append to
#                                   .claude/state/definition-drift-acks.log
#                                   (mirrors the resume-acks.log pattern).
#     CREATED  (no snapshot entry — the definition did not exist at session
#               start; the creator-teammate-hires-then-orchestrator-spawns
#               flow, which has historically worked same-session)
#                                -> ALLOW + warn + log. See "OPEN QUESTION".
#     UNCHANGED                  -> ALLOW silently.
#     NO DEFINITION FILE (built-in types: Explore/Plan/general-purpose/claude/
#               claude-code-guide/statusline-setup, or any type with no
#               `.claude/agents/<type>.md`)
#                                -> ALLOW silently.
#     NO SNAPSHOT / UNPARSEABLE PAYLOAD / NO python3 / NO sha256 tool
#                                -> ALLOW + warn. Never block.
#
# FAIL-OPEN BY DESIGN — AND WHY THAT IS NOT A WEAKNESS HERE:
#   The sibling guards (guard-worktree-isolation.sh, guard-resume-isolation.sh)
#   fail CLOSED, because each of those can evaluate its contract from the
#   payload alone: an unparseable spawn is by definition not a proven-correct
#   spawn. This guard is different in kind — it can only ever
#   PROVE DRIFT (a hash mismatch against a recorded baseline); it can never
#   prove freshness. With no snapshot to compare against there is no evidence of
#   anything, and blocking every spawn on "no evidence" would halt the whole
#   team the first session after this hook lands (when no snapshot exists yet)
#   and on every machine where the state dir is unwritable. So: block ONLY on
#   positive proof of drift; warn on everything indeterminate. The blocking
#   sibling guard runs FIRST in the same PreToolUse[Agent] chain and already
#   fails closed on an unparseable payload, so nothing is lost.
#
# OPEN QUESTION — NEW definitions fail OPEN, deliberately:
#   We know MODIFIED definitions do not reach a newly spawned agent (proven).
#   We do NOT have equally hard evidence for a definition file CREATED
#   mid-session: the creator teammate (CREATOR_TEAMMATE in
#   orchestration.config) hires and the orchestrator spawns the new hire in
#   the same session routinely, which suggests the harness resolves an
#   unknown subagent_type from disk on demand. Rather than block a flow with a
#   working track record on an untested theory, a created-since-snapshot
#   definition is ALLOWED with a warning line (logged to
#   .claude/state/definition-drift.log). If a fresh-hire spawn is ever observed
#   booting empty/stale, flip CREATED to BLOCK — the branch is isolated below.
#
# PreToolUse[Agent] payload (same shape guard-worktree-isolation.sh parses):
#   { "tool_name": "Agent",
#     "tool_input": { "subagent_type": "dev", "name": "dev-sonnet-c1",
#                     "prompt": "...", "isolation": "worktree", ... },
#     "session_id": "<uuid>" }
#
# Exit codes (Claude Code PreToolUse convention):
#   0  allowed (silently, or with a warning on stderr)
#   2  BLOCKED — provable definition drift with no matching ack
#
# TEST OVERRIDE: DEFINITION_DRIFT_ROOT forces the root directory (test-only;
# never set in a real session). The partner snapshot hook honours the same
# variable.
#
# NOTE: hooks are snapshotted per session; this guard takes effect from the
# NEXT session. It assumes nothing about being live in the session that adds it.
#
# UNEVALUATED-PAYLOAD-EXEMPT: already-announces — its own warn_allow() names the unverified spawn, and since
# 2026-09-05 it does so as a systemMessage rather than on stderr alone — which
# is what made the warning reach anyone. It loses no check on a degraded
# payload (it can only ever PROVE drift, never freshness), so it needs the
# announcement and not the stand-down.
#
# Declared rather than assumed, and CHECKED rather than believed:
# scripts/hooks/unevaluated-payload.test.sh derives every registered
# PreToolUse and Stop hook from hooks/hooks.json and requires each one to be
# either wired to scripts/lib/unevaluated-notice.sh or carrying a line like
# this one — and then verifies the CLASS by driving the hook with an empty, a
# truncated and a non-JSON payload. An undeclared hook fails that suite; a
# falsely declared one fails it too.
