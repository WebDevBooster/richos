# worker-created-handoff.sh — PostToolUse[Agent] hook. LOG-ONLY; never blocks.
#
# THE GAP THIS CLOSES. Until this hook existed the engine emitted exactly two
# worker signals — a task COMPLETED (task-completed-handoff.sh) and a teammate
# went IDLE (teammate-idle-handoff.sh). A worker's CREATION was observed by
# guard-worktree-isolation.sh's partner (detect-nonnative-worktree.sh, which
# appends the plain-text spawned-names.log) and then thrown away as far as any
# typed consumer was concerned. That is precisely why the desktop app's
# worker_status.rs reports `active: 0` structurally: with no authoritative
# start, "currently active" could only ever have been guessed at, and it
# refuses to guess. This hook supplies the missing signal.
#
#   -> <team dir>/worker-events.jsonl   (fallback: ~/.claude/worker-events.jsonl)
#
# Full stream contract, and the per-state observability table (which of the
# seven UX states have a real source and which do not):
#   docs/worker-lifecycle-events.md
#
# WHY PostToolUse AND NOT PreToolUse. PreToolUse[Agent] fires on the INTENT to
# spawn. It runs FIRST in a four-hook chain and any later hook — or this one's
# own sibling guards — can still veto the same call, so a PreToolUse-sourced
# "created" event would invent workers that were never created. That is not a
# hypothetical: the identical mistake, made with the spawned-names ledger,
# burned names for teammates that never existed and is written up under
# "BLOCKED-SPAWN NAME BURN" in guard-worktree-isolation.sh. PostToolUse fires
# only for a call that actually ran, which makes "logged" and "created" the
# same event, and makes a BLOCKED spawn produce silence rather than a phantom
# active worker. (Claude Code routes a FAILED tool call to PostToolUseFailure,
# a different event this hook is not registered on, so even an errored spawn
# cannot reach here.)
#
# WHY THE ASYNC-LAUNCH ACKNOWLEDGEMENT IS REQUIRED. The Agent tool has two
# shapes. A backgrounded team spawn returns immediately with an acknowledgement
# naming the new agent ("Async agent launched successfully ... agentId: <id>")
# while the worker runs on; that return IS the creation. A SYNCHRONOUS subagent
# run, by contrast, returns its finished result — its PostToolUse fires when
# the work is already OVER. Emitting "created" for the second shape would
# announce a live worker at the moment it stopped existing. So this hook emits
# ONLY when the async acknowledgement is present and an agent_id can be
# extracted from it, and is silent otherwise. Silence is the honest answer: a
# synchronous Agent call is not a background worker, and §7 of the UX design is
# about background workers.
#
# WHAT THIS EVENT DOES AND DOES NOT CLAIM. It claims: the harness accepted this
# spawn and returned an agent id for it. It does NOT claim the worker has begun
# executing — that is a separate observation with its own hook
# (worker-started-handoff.sh, on SubagentStart). Nor does it claim the worker
# is STILL running: liveness is only ever "a created/started with no later
# terminal event", and the terminal events have their own hooks too
# (worker-ended-handoff.sh on SubagentStop; plus the pre-existing TeammateIdle
# and TaskCompleted logs). A consumer that wants an active COUNT composes those
# events; it must never infer one from this event alone.
#
# NEVER BLOCKS, ALWAYS EXIT 0. Same contract as the two sibling handoff hooks:
# any parse or IO error exits 0. A tool call must never fail because logging
# failed. Env override for tests: WORKER_EVENTS_TEAMS_DIR.
