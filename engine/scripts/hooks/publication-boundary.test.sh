# publication-boundary.test.sh — regression tests for the publication-boundary
# mechanism: scripts/lib/publication-boundary.sh, its python predicate, and the
# two guards that run it (guard-publication-writes.sh on Write/Edit/MultiEdit/
# NotebookEdit, guard-publication-commits.sh on Bash `git commit`).
#
# ONE suite for all three files on purpose. They are one subject — a predicate
# and its two chokepoints — and splitting them would create two places to
# remember to update, which is the defect class the whole mechanism exists to
# remove.
#
# A NOTE ON THE HARNESS, because it got this wrong once and the lesson is the
# same one the mechanism is about. The first version fed content to each case
# through a PIPE (`make_transcript | write_case ...`). Bash runs the right-hand
# side of a pipe in a SUBSHELL, so every PASS/FAIL increment inside it was
# discarded: the suite printed 48 result lines and reported "26 passed, 0
# failed", and a genuine failure inside a piped case would have been counted by
# nothing and exited 0. A tally that is not the inventory it claims to describe
# — exactly the "18/18 suites" defect, reproduced inside the test suite written
# to prevent that defect's cousin. Content now travels by FILE, and every
# assertion runs in the top-level shell where its counter lives.
#
# Covers:
#   (a) STAND-DOWN — a repository with no .publication-boundary is untouched.
#       This is the precision floor: get it wrong and the guard fires in every
#       repository on the machine.
#   (b) THE REAL FAILURE — a transcript-shaped file, and prose reproducing the
#       private corpus verbatim, both refused, across every tool shape.
#   (c) POSITIVE CONTROLS — ordinary source, docs, a technology evaluation that
#       quotes nothing, measurement conclusions with the speech removed, a log
#       file and an attributed changelog all write cleanly. These matter more
#       than the block: a guard that blocks legitimate work gets disabled, and
#       then protects nothing.
#   (d) GITIGNORED DESTINATION — the same private bytes to an ignored path are
#       ALLOWED. That is the correct destination, not a grudging exception.
#   (e) ALLOWLIST — a committed exemption works, and it is the ONLY way through,
#       because these two guards deliberately ship no in-prompt override token.
#   (m) THE GROUPED DIRECTORY — the declaration may live at
#       `.richos/publication-boundary`, and the move must not stand the guard
#       down. Proved by a REFUSAL, never by a load: a guard that found the file
#       and then decided nothing would pass any test that only asked whether it
#       was found. Declared in both places at once BLOCKS, and a DECLARATION in
#       `.richos/` that nothing resolves BLOCKS, because the alternative is a
#       publication contract switched off by a `git mv`. Anything else sharing
#       that directory is left alone: it is a shared RichOS directory, and a
#       guard policing all of it would take an adopter offline.
#   (f) BROKEN DECLARATIONS — unknown key, non-KEY=value line, a threshold below
#       the measured floor, and a PRIVATE_SOURCES tree that is inside the repo
#       and NOT gitignored: every one BLOCKS rather than degrading quietly.
#   (g) THE COMMIT CHOKEPOINT — content that never passed through a Write tool
#       (cp, git mv, a generator) is caught at `git commit`; unrelated Bash and
#       clean commits pass; `git commit -m "... -a ..."` is not mistaken for a
#       `-a` commit; a binary blob is never handed to the text scanner.
#   (h) WHAT THE COMMAND IS ABOUT TO STAGE. The hook runs BEFORE the command,
#       so `git add X && git commit` has an empty index at check time; a whole
#       new directory of transcripts arrives as ONE porcelain entry with no
#       bytes behind it; and a pathspec or `-a` commit records the WORKTREE
#       copy, not the index copy. Every one of those passed before, with the
#       controls that keep ordinary `git add src/newmod && git commit` clean.
#   (i) THE CORPUS CLOSURE. A second rendering of a recording — whisper's plain
#       text output, no timestamps — joins the corpus; a brief that merely
#       QUOTES the recording does not, so its boilerplate never becomes
#       "private" and never blocks ordinary work.
#   (i2) MEDIA PROVENANCE. The FIRST rendering of a recording, when that
#       rendering is plain text. The shape filter cannot see it and the closure
#       can only extend a seed, never create one — so a recording transcribed
#       straight to plain text was invisible to the corpus whole, and both
#       guards passed 6,000 characters of one in silence. A text file named as a
#       rendering of a media file beside it now seeds; an unrelated stem, a stem
#       below the length floor, and the same name with no media beside it do
#       not, and those three refusals are why the narrow rule was chosen.
#   (i3) THE VACUITY FLOOR AND THE ORACLE. A corpus that is empty is BROKEN, not
#       CLEAN, because everything after the corpus is conditional on it and a
#       guard that reports clean having read nothing is this whole mechanism's
#       defect in one line. Plus the negative control for THIS SUITE: the
#       scanner reports the corpus it examined, so a green run cannot mean
#       "every case passed because there was nothing to compare against".
#   (l) PRIVATE BY IDENTITY. The file class both scanners score at zero: a
#       note that is private because of WHICH FILE IT IS. Declared as
#       `<sha256>:<name>` in PRIVATE_FILES, it is refused renamed, reformatted,
#       re-encoded, into a gitignored path, and as a binary blob the NUL filter
#       used to drop — with the positive controls that keep that from being
#       paranoia, the malformed-declaration refusals, and the oracle for how
#       many declarations a run actually compared against. Every fixture is
#       synthetic: the file this was built for never enters this repository,
#       including as a test fixture, which would be the failure executed.
#   (j) FAIL-CLOSED / FAIL-OPEN conventions, matching the hook family.
#   (k) REGISTRATION on BOTH surfaces plus the probe's oracle.
#
# Run directly: scripts/hooks/publication-boundary.test.sh
# Exit 0 = all cases pass; exit 1 = at least one failure.

right so we are recording now and everything looks good on my end
yes I can see you fine let us start whenever you are ready to go
okay so the thing I wanted to walk through today is the migration
before you do that can I ask about the timeline you mentioned earlier
sure the timeline is the part I am least confident about right now
that is fair and honestly I would rather hear that than a guess
exactly so let us take it one piece at a time and see where we land
sounds good to me go ahead and share whatever you have prepared
alright I will start with the numbers and then we can talk shape

# (h) WHAT THE COMMAND IS ABOUT TO STAGE — the not-yet-in-the-index shapes.
#
# This hook runs BEFORE the command it inspects, so for `git add X && git
# commit` nothing is staged at the moment of the check. Measured 2026-08-30
# against the shipped guard: every shape below PASSED with a wholly-new
# directory of transcripts sitting in the working tree, because `git diff
# --cached` was empty and the guard exited 0 having read nothing.
#
# The directory is the point. `git status --porcelain` reports a wholly-new
# directory as ONE entry — `?? docs/session-notes/` — which is a path with no
# bytes behind it, so an enumeration that stops there examines zero and reports
# clean. The controls under it matter as much: a guard that starts refusing
# ordinary `git add src/newmod && git commit` is a guard somebody switches off.

# (i2) MEDIA PROVENANCE — the FIRST rendering of a recording.
#
# THE HOLE THESE CASES PIN, measured 2026-08-30. The shape filter admits a
# transcript that LOOKS like one; the closure admits another rendering of
# something already admitted. Neither can admit the first and only rendering of
# a recording that was transcribed straight to plain text — whisper `.txt` has
# no timestamps and no speaker labels, so it has zero transcript-shaped lines,
# and the closure can only EXTEND a seed, never create one.
#
# On the real private record that left three podcast transcripts of two named
# third-party guests — 5,713, 6,424 and 22,375 words — entirely outside a corpus
# that held ten files. A 6,000-character extract of one of them was written into
# the publication-bound repository and BOTH guards returned exit 0 in silence:
# the commit guard, which exists precisely to catch what the write hook misses,
# runs the same predicate and missed it identically.
#
# The signal is provenance, not content: the transcript sits next to the
# recording it came from, under a name derived from it. The three refusal cases
# below are the precision controls, and they are the point — the WIDER rule
# ("any text file in a directory holding media") reaches the same corpus on the
# real tree by admitting a mixed 51 KB worksheet on a coincidence of directory,
# and admitting mixed documents on weak evidence is what once put engineering
# boilerplate into the private corpus and blocked LICENSE files.

# CLEAN. A guard announcing it found no private material when it never had any
# private material to compare against — the "no media committed" check wearing
# a different hat, and the "18/18 suites" tally that described a glob instead
# of an inventory.
#
# This is not a hypothetical either: pb_resolve_sources records the day
# `../richos-hq` resolved, inside a linked worktree, to a path that does not
# exist. The sharpest detector this mechanism has went inert in exactly the
# place all the work happens, and the only symptom was one honest line in a
# message nobody reads on a PASS. That fix made the path resolve. These cases
# make the silence impossible.
#
# The LAST case is the negative control for this entire suite: it asserts the

# passed because the corpus was empty" — which is the very failure under test.
