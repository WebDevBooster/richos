# guard-stale-staging.sh — BLOCKING PreToolUse guard on the Agent tool.
#
# REFUSES A DISPATCH THAT WILL WORK ON, OR TEST AGAINST, A PRODUCT TREE WHOSE
# LANDED COMMITS HAVE NOT REACHED STAGING.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS TO PREVENT
# ===========================================================================
# The adopting repository's own rule, in its words:
#
#     "Staging MUST be brought current BEFORE the next `avelor/` or `fitapp/`
#      work or QA run, whatever landed in between. That is where the protection
#      actually lives, and it is a precondition of resuming product work rather
#      than a per-land chore."
#
# That is a paragraph, and a paragraph is a promise. Nothing enforced it. The
# first product QA run after a gap meets a staging that is weeks stale, and the
# only thing between that and a false QA verdict is somebody remembering a
# sentence. A rule enforced by attention lasts exactly as long as the attention
# — the same finding this engine's row-currency contract was built from.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE HALF THAT MATTERS MORE: WHAT THIS MUST *NOT* DO
# ===========================================================================
# The same ruling that created the obligation also bounded it, on 2026-09-02,
# after a failed deploy was reported to the founder FIVE TIMES in a day during
# which 35 commits landed and ZERO touched product code:
#
#     "A land touching only `scripts/`, `docs/`, `.claude/`, `skills/` or the
#      record still deploys when deploy is working. But a deploy failure on
#      such a land is RECORDED, NEVER REPORTED — nothing shipped and nothing is
#      at risk."
#
# A guard that cannot tell those two cases apart fires on every docs land, gets
# waived on the day, and habitual waiving is how a guard dies. This engine has
# three recorded instances of that shape in a single day.
#
# SO THE REFUSAL IS A CONJUNCTION OF THREE FACTS, AND ALL THREE MUST HOLD:
#
#   1. There is a RECORD of what staging has, and it is behind main.
#   2. The commits between the record and main TOUCH A DECLARED PRODUCT TREE.
#      This is the whole of the 2026-09-02 amendment, mechanized. A staging 35
#      commits behind on docs is SILENT — not tolerated, not warned about,
#      silent — because nothing shipped and nothing is at risk.
#   3. THIS dispatch is product work or a run against staging.
#
# Fact 2 is computed from git and is the one that keeps the guard alive: in the
# adopting repository at the time this was written, `avelor/` had not changed
# since 2026-07-28 and `fitapp/` since 2026-05-05, so the guard is structurally
# incapable of firing until product work resumes — which is the moment the rule
# exists for. Fact 3's prose classifier is deliberately allowed to be a little
# broad BECAUSE fact 2 gates it: an over-broad match can only produce a refusal
# inside the window between a product land and its deploy, and inside that
# window "you mentioned avelor/ and testing" is the RIGHT time to be stopped.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY PreToolUse[Agent], AND NOT THE LAND
# ===========================================================================
# The row that asked for this offered two chokepoints — the land, or the
# dispatch. The ruling picks for us: the obligation is "a precondition of
# resuming product work rather than a per-land chore". Refusing the LAND would
# also be backwards, because the land is both what creates the debt and what
# discharges it (deploy is the land's last step); a guard there would wedge the
# very command that fixes it.
#
# Rejected alternatives, argued rather than left to be re-derived:
#
#   PreToolUse[Bash] on the test command — REJECTED. It would have to match
#     every shape of "run something against staging", a large and open class,
#     and it fires after the dispatch that already committed the work.
#   A Stop-hook notice — REJECTED. It reports a QA run that already happened
#     against a stale environment, which is the verdict this exists to prevent.
#   A checklist in the land skill — REJECTED for the reason the paragraph it
#     replaces failed: enforcement by attention.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE RECORD — WHY A LOCAL FILE, AND WHAT ITS ABSENCE MEANS
# ===========================================================================
# "What does staging have?" has exactly one trustworthy answer and it is not a
# network call. The founder's standing ruling (11.4) is that the Railway login
# is restored when product work resumes and NOT before, so a guard that phoned
# the platform would fail at precisely the moment it matters. A PreToolUse hook
# also must not spend seconds on HTTP.
#
# So the guard reads a LOCAL, DURABLE record that the deploy writes:
#
#     <entity root>/.claude/state/staging-deployed     (STAGING_DEPLOY_RECORD)
#
#         sha=8f3a1c2b9d40
#         outcome=success
#         tree=avelor
#         at=2026-09-06T10:11:12Z
#
# New records are stored separately at <record>.trees/<tree> (nested tree
# slashes are encoded as %2F). A legacy record with tree= names only that tree;
# an unscoped legacy record is usable only with one declared product tree.
# Deploying one product never certifies another product.
#
# Minted by scripts/staging-record.sh, which the deploy script calls once its
# own freshness gate has passed — never before, so a record can never claim a
# deploy that did not finish. `outcome=` anything but `success` is read as NO
# RECORD, deliberately: "the deploy ran and failed" and "staging is current"
# must never produce the same verdict.
#
# ADOPTION COSTS NOTHING ON THE DAY IT HAPPENS, and that is a design decision
# taken from measurement rather than taste. On 2026-09-06 the sibling headline
# contract was measured on the real record: declaring its jurisdiction produced
# ZERO refusals and 26 rows named, and its teeth were a SECOND declared key.
# The same two-key shape is used here. Until a deploy has ever written a
# record, this guard ALLOWS and ANNOUNCES — and it announces only at the moment
# of a dispatch that would have been in scope, never on the 99% of dispatches
# that have nothing to do with the product. Declare STAGING_RECORD_REQUIRED=1
# when the deploy is wired and the absence of a record should itself refuse.
#
# ===========================================================================
# FAIL OPEN, AND LOUDLY — but never on the quiet path
# ===========================================================================
#   NOT ADOPTED (no orchestration.config)   -> STAND DOWN, silent.
#   STAGING_TREES NOT DECLARED              -> STAND DOWN, SILENT. This is the
#     adoption switch and its absence is silent, unlike the model ceiling's:
#     most repositories have no staging at all, and a per-spawn announcement in
#     every one of them is noise rather than protection.
#   NO DEBT (record current, or nothing
#   product-shaped between it and main)     -> SILENT. Always. See fact 2.
#   NOT AN IN-SCOPE DISPATCH                -> SILENT.
#   RECORD MISSING / MALFORMED / FAILED,
#   on an IN-SCOPE dispatch                 -> ALLOW + ANNOUNCE (or REFUSE if
#     STAGING_RECORD_REQUIRED=1).
#   GIT, PYTHON3, CONFIG OR ROOTS UNREADABLE-> ALLOW + ANNOUNCE. "I cannot
#     tell" is never "forbidden".
#
# The one thing that is NOT fail-open: scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh missing
# entirely. That is the shared bootstrap's contract and probe Layer R asserts
# every rooted hook carries it byte-identically.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE UNEVALUATED-PAYLOAD DECLARATION, AND WHY IT LOOKS WRONG UNTIL YOU READ IT
# ===========================================================================
# UNEVALUATED-PAYLOAD-EXEMPT: payload-independent — in a repository that has
# not declared STAGING_TREES this hook stands down at the adoption switch
# BEFORE it parses anything, so its verdict on an empty, truncated or non-JSON
# payload is the same exit 0 in the same silence as its verdict on a perfect
# one. Most repositories on a machine are in that state and none of them
# adopted this contract, so announcing there would be a nag about a gate they
# never asked for — and stale-staging.test.sh case 1d asserts the stronger
# thing, that an unadopted repository is not merely quiet but accumulates NO
# STATE, which a notice would violate by writing
# .claude/state/unevaluated-payloads.log into it.
#
# THE CLAIM IS CONDITIONAL AND THE CONDITION IS THE DECLARATION. Where
# STAGING_TREES IS declared this hook is emphatically payload-DEPENDENT, and it
# wires scripts/lib/unevaluated-notice.sh a few lines below exactly like its
# siblings — an adopted repository hears about a call this guard could not
# read. So read the marker above as "payload-independent while stood down",
# which is the only state unevaluated-payload.test.sh can observe from a
# repository that has not adopted the contract, and which that suite verifies
# empirically rather than on trust: it drives all four payloads and requires
# the output to be identical.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE ESCAPE HATCH — a live prompt line, with a reason, logged
# ===========================================================================
#     stale-staging-ack: <reason>
#
# anywhere on its own line in the Agent spawn prompt. It permits that ONE
# dispatch and appends to <entity root>/.claude/state/stale-staging-acks.log.
# Same idiom as `model-ceiling-ack:`, `main-checkout-run:`, `resume-ack:` and
# `data-contract-bypass:`. A bare marker exempts nothing.
#
# There IS an escape hatch here, unlike the row-currency contract's deliberate
# refusal to have one, and the difference is real: row currency's judgment ("I
# will fix the row after the deploy") fails at the moment of the land, so an
# override would have been used every time. This guard's legitimate exception
# is a different thing entirely — a dispatch that names a product path while
# genuinely not testing against staging (reading the code, auditing a diff,
# writing a plan). Refusing those with no way through would make the guard a
# nuisance on exactly the tasks that are safe, which is how a guard gets
# routed around instead of used.
#
# NOTE: hooks are snapshotted at session start. This one is INERT until the
# next session — it assumes nothing about being live in the session that adds it.

# --- ROOT RESOLUTION -------------------------------------------------------
# TWO ROOTS, NEVER ONE. The full contract, and why the old single-root
# resolution was wrong the moment the engine became loadable by reference,
# is in scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. This bootstrap block is byte-identical
# in every hook that needs a root; contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R asserts
# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
