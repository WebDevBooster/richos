# guard-ci-red-lands.sh — BLOCKING PreToolUse[Bash] guard.
#
# REFUSES A LAND INTO A BRANCH WHOSE CI IS RED, UNLESS THE LAND SAYS WHY IT
# CANNOT WAIT.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS TO PREVENT
# ===========================================================================
# On 2026-09-10 three workflows were red on main across two repositories, one
# of them for thirteen days, and a fourth — the dependabot workflow — had been
# failing for five days without ever being named in any report.
#
# Thirteen days was possible for one reason and it is not neglect:
#
#     RED COST NOTHING. Work landed on top of it at the same rate it landed on
#     top of green. So the only thing standing between a broken workflow and a
#     fortnight was somebody's attention, and a rule enforced by attention
#     lasts exactly as long as the attention.
#
# This makes red cost something, at the one moment where the cost is
# proportionate: the land. Not the commit — engineers commit dozens of times a
# day and blocking that would be absurd. Not the dispatch — the work is not the
# problem. The LAND, which is the act of putting more on top of a foundation
# that is already failing.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE HALF THAT MATTERS MORE: WHY THIS DOES NOT DIE THE WAY g11/g12/g13 DIED
# ===========================================================================
# This project killed three guards in a single day by making them broad enough
# that waiving became the daily habit, and a guard that is habitually waived is
# worse than no guard: it costs a keystroke and buys a false sense of a floor.
#
# So the refusal is a CONJUNCTION, and every clause narrows it:
#
#   1. The command is a LAND — `git merge` or `git push`. Not commit, not add,
#      not fetch, not status, not a `push` to a teammate branch.
#   2. It targets the WATCHED BRANCH (main by default). A push of a worktree
#      branch is silent, and that is the overwhelming majority of pushes.
#   3. The TARGET REPOSITORY has red RIGHT NOW. Not another repository's red,
#      not a repository this session merely has open. When CI is clean this
#      guard is structurally incapable of firing.
#   4. Only the RED axis. The six-axis reader (`ci-status.sh`) also reports
#      slow, skipped, never-run, stale and hollow, and today it reports 52
#      findings. Gating on all of them would refuse every land in this
#      repository until an unrelated backlog is cleared, which is precisely how
#      a guard earns a reflexive waiver. Those five axes are REPORTED, loudly
#      and per-workflow. Only red BLOCKS.
#
# And the escape hatch is narrow in a way that makes its own overuse visible:
#
#   ci-red-ack: <workflow> — <why this land cannot wait>
#
#   * It must NAME a workflow that is ACTUALLY RED. An ack naming something
#     green, or naming nothing, is refused — a bare marker exempts nothing,
#     the same discipline the contrast floor and the dialect guard use.
#   * It must carry a reason of real length. "wip" is not a reason.
#   * IT DOES NOT COVER THE OTHER RED WORKFLOWS. Acking `ui-suite-ci.yml` while
#     `packaging-ci.yml` is also red still refuses, and names the one that was
#     not acked. Acking every one of them is possible and is exactly as much
#     typing as there are broken workflows, which is the intended shape.
#   * EVERY ACCEPTED ACK IS LOGGED, and the refusal message PRINTS HOW MANY
#     TIMES THIS SAME WORKFLOW HAS ALREADY BEEN ACKED. That is the anti-habit
#     mechanism: the fifth ack for the same workflow says "this is the 5th ack
#     for ui-suite-ci.yml since 2026-09-10", which turns a habit into evidence
#     without blocking anybody's day.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT IT DOES WHEN IT CANNOT TELL — AND WHY THAT IS exit 0
# ===========================================================================
# `ci-red.py` answers red / clear / UNKNOWN. On UNKNOWN this guard ANNOUNCES,
# loudly, on stderr, and ALLOWS.
#
# That is deliberate and it is the opposite of this engine's usual fail-closed
# instinct, so here is the argument. GitHub being slow, a token expiring, or an
# aeroplane is not evidence of red. Blocking on it would refuse lands for
# reasons unrelated to CI, several times a week, and the fix on the day would
# always be to waive — the g11/g12/g13 death, arrived at by a different road.
# The protection that survives is the one that fires only on a fact it actually
# established.
#
# The announcement is not decoration: it names what could not be read and the
# command that would answer it, and the unattended watch job (ci-surface-
# watch.sh) keeps a fresh reading on disk precisely so that this path is rare.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE SECOND CANNOT-TELL: A PAYLOAD THIS GUARD CANNOT READ. SAME VERDICT,
# AND UNTIL 2026-09-10 IT WAS TAKEN IN SILENCE.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The paragraph above is about not being able to read CI. This one is about not
# being able to read THE CALL. An empty, truncated or non-JSON payload reaches
# the classifier below, which prints `skip  unparseable payload`, and the very
# next line — `[ "$KIND" = "land" ] || exit 0` — takes the identical silent exit
# that a `ls` takes. Byte for byte, a call this gate never looked at was
# indistinguishable from a call it looked at and approved. That was the defect,
# and it is the defect this whole engine is named after in
# scripts/lib/unevaluated-notice.sh: THE ABSENCE OF A FINDING MUST BE
# DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE ABSENCE OF A CHECK.
#
# THE PREDICATE, DECIDED AND DECLARED: an unreadable payload ALLOWS, OUT LOUD.
# It is announced on stderr and on the operator channel, logged to
# .claude/state/unevaluated-payloads.log, and the call proceeds. Only the
# silence changed; no verdict did.
#
# WHY NOT FAIL CLOSED, WHEN THE SIBLING BARRIER DOES. guard-sealed-worktree.sh
# refuses an unparseable payload and probe Layer Q6 proves ten arms of it. The
# difference is not nerve, it is the recovery path:
#
#   1. THE POPULATION. That barrier judges a worker's writes inside a sealed
#      transaction. This one is PreToolUse[Bash] — it is handed EVERY shell
#      command in the session, and its predicate is a four-clause conjunction
#      whose FIRST clause is false for almost all of them. Measured over the 12
#      most recently touched transcripts on this machine (2026-09-10): 313 Bash
#      calls, 39 of which so much as mention `git merge` or `git push` — 12.5%,
#      before the branch, the redness and the ack narrow it further. RE-DERIVE
#      IT RATHER THAN TRUST IT: take the 12 most recently modified
#      ~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl, count every assistant `tool_use` block whose
#      name is `Bash`, and count how many of their `command` strings match
#      \bgit\s+(merge|push)\b. One machine, one day — what the argument rests on
#      is only that lands are a small minority of shell calls, which is the same
#      premise the classifier below is built on. Refusing on
#      an unreadable payload would refuse 100% of them, because an unreadable
#      payload is exactly the state in which the narrowing cannot be applied. A
#      land gate would have become a session brick.
#   2. THE HATCH IS INSIDE THE THING THAT IS BROKEN. `ci-red-ack:` is read off
#      the command line, and the command line arrives in the payload. If the
#      payload cannot be read, the ack cannot be read either — so a fail-closed
#      arm here has NO reachable escape hatch, and the only way out of a stuck
#      session would be to disable the plugin, which disables all 29 PreToolUse
#      guards at once. The cure would remove more protection than the disease.
#      guard-sealed-worktree.sh has no such problem: its seal lives in the
#      transaction store, out of band, so a refusal there is recoverable
#      without reading the payload. THAT is the line between the two answers —
#      fail closed when the recovery path does not run through the break.
#   3. EVIDENCE. This gate refuses only on a fact it established. "Could not
#      look" is not evidence of red; "could not read the call" is not even
#      evidence that this call is a land.
#
# ALSO REJECTED: scanning the raw payload bytes for a land-shaped command and
# refusing on that. It is tempting because it would keep the blast radius
# narrow, and it is wrong three times over. The classifier below is written in
# python with shlex precisely because a regex over a command line is how a
# classifier acquires holes — and a TRUNCATED payload is a partial command by
# construction, so `git push origin main-fix` cut mid-token reads as a push to
# main. It would refuse a command it cannot quote back, on evidence it cannot
# show, with an ack it also cannot read. And it would buy that risk for a case
# that has never occurred in a live session: every payload in an ordinary
# session is well-formed — the 2026-09-05 survey had to CONSTRUCT the degraded
# ones.
#
# WHAT WOULD CHANGE THE ANSWER: a measured, recurring source of malformed
# payloads in live sessions. Then "rare" stops being true, the announcement
# stops being enough, and the right fix is a bounded, well-formed read at the
# host boundary — not a guess made here. Cases R15/R16 of this guard's suite
# pin both halves of the current answer, and unevaluated-payload.test.sh case
# 4b holds every registered guard to it.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY NOT A CHECK INSIDE THE LAND SKILL
# ===========================================================================
# Rejected for the reason the paragraph it replaces failed: enforcement by
# attention. The land skill already says to verify things and the verification
# that gets skipped is always the one nobody is holding a stopwatch on.
#
# Exit codes:  0 allow (silently, or with an announcement)   2 refuse

# --- UNEVALUATED-PAYLOAD NOTICE --------------------------------------------
# On a payload it cannot read, this guard takes the SAME silent exit 0 that any

# payload` and the dispatch line cannot tell that apart from `not a land`. That
# is why 17 of 25 PreToolUse guards were measured passing a call in complete
# silence on 2026-09-05. This separates the two. NO VERDICT CHANGES — the exit
# is the one already taken, and the header above argues at length why allowing
# is the right verdict for THIS gate where guard-sealed-worktree.sh refuses.
# Only the silence changes. The measurement, the channel and the argument:
# scripts/lib/unevaluated-notice.sh.
#
# THE ROOT ARGUMENT IS DELIBERATELY LEFT EMPTY-OR-INHERITED. Every sibling
# passes the root it already resolved; this guard resolves none, because it
# governs by GIT JURISDICTION per command (section 2 below) and resolving an
# entity root here would put git calls in front of EVERY shell command in the
# session for the sake of a log line. So the announcement is the record, and the
# durable line in .claude/state/unevaluated-payloads.log is written only when a
# root is already declared in the environment. An unadopted repository still
# costs nothing and has nothing created inside it.

# 1. IS THIS A LAND?
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Classified in python because a shell `case` over a command line with
# quoting, `&&` and here-documents is how a classifier acquires holes. It is
# deliberately CONSERVATIVE: anything it is unsure of is not a land, and a
# missed land costs nothing that the six-axis report does not already say out
# loud, while a false land is a refusal on ordinary work.
#
# The payload arrives on STDIN, so the script itself cannot: it is held in a
# variable and passed with `-c`, the same shape scripts/lib/git-jurisdiction.sh
# uses and for the same reason.
# NOTE ON BASH 3.2, which is what `#!/usr/bin/env bash` resolves to on macOS.
# The obvious `VAR="$(cat <<'PY' ... PY)"` DOES NOT PARSE there: 3.2 scans for
# the closing parenthesis of a command substitution before it processes the
# here-document, so an apostrophe or a bracket inside the Python body ends the
# scan in the wrong place and the file dies with "unexpected EOF while looking
# for matching `)'". `read -r -d ''` has no such scan. Found by running this
# guard's own suite under /bin/bash rather than the login shell.
