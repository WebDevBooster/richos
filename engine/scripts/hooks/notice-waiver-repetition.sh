# notice-waiver-repetition.sh — NON-BLOCKING Stop hook. A TURN DOES NOT END
#                               QUIETLY WHILE AN ESCAPE HATCH IS BEING USED
#                               OVER AND OVER FOR THE SAME REASON.
#
# The argument — why 251 waivers in one day is a broken-guard report and not a
# discipline problem, why every constant is what it is, and how the ledgers are
# discovered without a typed list — is in scripts/hooks/notice-waiver-
# repetition.py. Read that first. This file is the wiring: resolve the two
# roots, hand the whole verdict to the analyzer, and say the one sentence.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY IT REPORTS AND DOES NOT BLOCK — argued, not defaulted to
# ===========================================================================
# The standing bar is that a deliverable which only reports has failed unless
# the report IS the mechanism. Here it is, and the reason is that the evidence
# was never missing — it was never READ. resume-acks.log held 226 entries
# across 122 recipients and 27 days, in plain text, in the repository, while
# the lead wrote entry 227. The hatches write; nothing reads. So the artifact
# that changes the outcome is the arithmetic, done automatically, on the one
# channel measured to reach the operator, in the turn before he writes the
# next one.
#
# Blocking would be the wrong instrument for a precise reason. The act it would
# refuse is the WAIVER — and in every case measured, the waiver was CORRECT:
# the teammate really was alive, the message really had to go. Refusing it
# punishes the operator for a DIFFERENT guard's false positive and wedges the
# session, which is exactly guard-inflight-notify.sh's reasoning about acks one
# event over ("blocking a land until another party acts is how a guard wedges a
# session"). And a blocking waiver-watcher would need its own escape hatch,
# which by this hook's own thesis would be waived 228 times.
#
# THIS HOOK HAS NO ESCAPE HATCH AND NO CONFIG KEY. An opt-out on the thing that
# watches opt-outs is absurd, and its absence is the whole reason this notice
# cannot decay the way the 228 did.
#
# ===========================================================================
# ONE LINE, STATE-CHANGE DE-DUPLICATED
# ===========================================================================
# systemMessage via scripts/lib/stop-hook-notice.sh, the only channel measured
# to reach the operator (see that file's table). The state key is the SET of
# flagged hatches plus each one's largest class rounded down to a power of two,
# so a new hatch crossing the line speaks, a fixed one going quiet speaks, and
# a doubling speaks — while 88 ticking to 89 does not. A condition repeated
# under every turn is a condition the eye is trained to skip, and this hook of
# all hooks must not become the thing it reports.
#
# NOTE: hooks are snapshotted at session start. This one is INERT until the
# next session — it assumes nothing about being live in the session that adds
# it.
#
# UNEVALUATED-PAYLOAD-EXEMPT: payload-independent — the predicate is the waiver log. Byte-identical output on all
# four payload shapes.
#
# WHY THIS ONE NEEDS A DECLARATION WHERE THE OTHER EXEMPT HOOKS DO NOT.
# scripts/hooks/unevaluated-payload.test.sh derives every registered PreToolUse
# and Stop hook from hooks/hooks.json and drives each with an empty, a truncated
# and a non-JSON payload. A hook that REFUSES them is proven fail-closed by that
# alone; a hook that ANNOUNCES on them is proven audible by that alone; neither
# needs a word in its source. But a hook that is SILENT on all four looks
# identical whether its predicate never needed the payload or its predicate was
# silently lost — which is the whole defect, and it is the one thing driving a
# hook cannot tell you. So payload-independence is the single class that must be
# CLAIMED by a person, and the suite then holds the claim to its consequence:
# the output must be identical on all four payloads. An undeclared silent hook
# fails that suite; a falsely declared one fails it too.

# --- ROOT RESOLUTION -------------------------------------------------------
# TWO ROOTS, NEVER ONE. The full contract, and why the old single-root
# resolution was wrong the moment the engine became loadable by reference,
# is in scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. This bootstrap block is byte-identical
# in every hook that needs a root; contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R asserts
# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
