# ceo-asks.test.sh — the CEO-ask gate, end to end, in a sandbox.
#
# Builds two real git repositories — a SEAT that has adopted the engine and a
# separate QUEUE repository that declares the CEO's TODOs — because that
# cross-repository shape is the normal one for this operation (a femcboost seat,
# a richos-hq queue) and a suite that only ever tested the single-repo case
# would pass over the configuration that actually ships.
#
# The SHIPPED hooks are driven with synthetic payloads. Nothing is stubbed
# except the entity root (RICHOS_ENTITY_ROOT), which is the one thing a test
# must not share with the live session.
#
# THE PROPERTY THIS SUITE EXISTS TO PIN, above all the others:
#
#   A QUESTION THAT MATCHES NOTHING DISCHARGES NOTHING.
#
# Without it, one junk question per session clears the gate forever and the
# whole mechanism becomes a formality with a log. Case C3 fires a junk question
# through the real witness and then asserts the real gate is STILL closed.
#
# Run directly:  scripts/hooks/ceo-asks.test.sh [--verbose]

## 1. Waiting on the CEO — a decision

### 1.1 READY-FOR-CEO — Apple signing and developer enrollment

- **Open:** \`q/wiki/packaging-and-signing.md\`
- **Time:** 15 minutes
- **Done:** a ruling recorded in ceo-decisions.md — individual enrollment, company enrollment, or an explicit not yet
- **Unblocks:** stable microphone grants across rebuilds

Prose that is not a field.

### 1.2 READY-FOR-CEO — The call-transcription default

- **Open:** \`q/wiki/call-transcription-approach.md\`
- **Time:** 15 minutes
- **Done:** a ruling recorded in ceo-decisions.md — switch the default now, or hold it
- **Unblocks:** the shipping default

## 2. Waiting on the CEO — his hands

### 2.1 READY-FOR-CEO — Verify the podcast reference transcript

- **Open:** \`q/docs/worksheet.md\`
- **Time:** 30 minutes
- **Done:** every one of the 30 windows carries OK or a written correction
- **Unblocks:** the first computable word error rate

### 2.2 ${1:-BLOCKED-ON-RICH} — Windows real-capture test

- **Open:** \`q/docs/windows-protocol.md\`
- **Time:** 20 minutes
- **Done:** every check in the protocol marked pass or fail
- **Unblocks:** the Windows capture path

## 3. Buildable now — nobody blocked

Nothing here.
