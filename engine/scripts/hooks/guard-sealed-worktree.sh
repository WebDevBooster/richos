#   "a finished agent never writes again. The platform restarts finished
#    agents (14 times observed). A restarted agent is refused every tool, so
#    it cannot write anywhere, including after its workspace is gone. This
#    lock-out already exists and stays."                          (point 9)
#
# FINISHED is the page's definition and nothing else (points 11 and 12), read
# from scripts/lib/workspaces.py: the platform's own end-of-run signal is
# recorded and Rich had not paused the agent before it — or it ended after
# handing in its work — or its session has ended (it recorded its end, or its
# process no longer exists, read from the operating system). A PAUSED agent is
# not finished: it keeps its workspaces, is not locked out, and resumes.
#
#   FINISHED worker            -> every tool refused, Read included, whatever
#                                 its agent_type (a type exemption says it owns
#                                 no workspace, not that it may return)
#   registered, not finished   -> passes (paused included)
#   UNREGISTERED worker        -> "If registration fails, the spawn does not
#                                 happen" (point 3). A worker's registration is
#                                 written by PreToolUse[Agent], SubagentStart
#                                 and PostToolUse[Agent]; this call waits
#                                 SEAL_WAIT_SECONDS for it, then refuses every
#                                 potentially writing tool. Read-only tools pass
#                                 so it can say why it stopped.
#   READ-ONLY AGENT TYPES      -> own no workspace; pass unless finished
#   the lead of a claude --worktree session
#                              -> "no one is allowed to do that" (point 3):
#                                 every tool but reading is refused
#   the lead, otherwise        -> passes
#
# How it tells the lead from a worker: the hooks reference documents that tool
# events fired inside a subagent carry `agent_id`, "present only when the hook
# fires inside a subagent call". A payload that PARSES and carries no agent_id
# is the lead's own call.
#
# FAIL CLOSED for a worker, on an unregistered worker and on its own error
# alike: when the barrier cannot evaluate a worker's call (python3 missing, the
# library missing, the root unresolvable, the payload unparseable, the resolver
# raising), a potentially writing or unknown tool is DENIED (exit 2) and a
# read-only tool passes. WITHOUT python3 the lead is proven only by the
# ABSENCE of an unescaped "agent_id" key in the raw JSON.
#
# NOTE: hooks are snapshotted at session start. This guard is inert until the
# next session and assumes nothing about being live in the session that adds it.
