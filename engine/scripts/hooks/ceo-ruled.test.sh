# ceo-ruled.test.sh — the CEO-RULED gate, both directions, every case red first.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
# ===========================================================================
# On 2026-09-01 the orchestrator put three questions to the CEO that the record
# already answered, each written down by the orchestrator itself hours or days
# earlier. guard-ceo-ruled-ask.sh refuses those; notice-ceo-ruled-prose.sh
# reports the prose ones. This suite proves BOTH DIRECTIONS, because a
# one-sided check is satisfied by a corpse:
#
#   REFUSED   the three real questions of that night, each citing the ruling it
#             found — reproduced from the session transcripts, not invented.
#   PASSED    a genuinely new question the record does not answer (which
#             monospace face to ship), and the ordinary machinery cases.
#
# AND EVERY ASSERTION IS RUN RED, ONE MUTATION AT A TIME. A green tick over a
# gate that refuses everything, or over a record that parsed to nothing, would
# be the same defect this engine has caught in itself repeatedly: Layer K green
# over a scanner that never ran. Section 3 is the negative controls, and each
# one changes exactly one thing.
#
# THE RECORD USED HERE IS A FIXTURE, not the live wiki, so the suite is
# deterministic on any machine. It is shaped to match the live register's
# statistics where those matter — "logo" appears in several rulings and is
# therefore vocabulary, "swoosh" appears repeatedly in one and is therefore a
# subject — because those statistics are what the predicate decides on. Section
# 6 runs the same four questions against the LIVE record when it is present on
# this machine, and says so plainly when it is not rather than passing.

# CEO decisions — the standing register

## What this page is

Prose about the register. Not a ruling.

## 14. The visual standard — `round-8.1/v0` is it, for dark (CEO, 2026-08-30)

**His words:** *"as far as the actual color palette for dark mode in general as
well as the overall design of the page elements including the background etc,
this becomes the current standard."*

The palette is the standard. It says nothing about the logo.

## 15. Light mode, theming, and two components ported from deeply (CEO, 2026-08-30)

The light standard is Daybreak. The wordmark and the logo both re-ink per theme.

### The wordmark replaces "My Company" (CEO, 2026-08-30)

The wordmark, not the logo, carries the product name in the rail.

## 16. Delete the ACP adapter — RichOS drives Claude directly (CEO, 2026-08-31)

**His words:** *"Delete it."* The adapter goes.

## 19. The payload — SHIP NOTHING EXTRA, 8.8 MB (CEO, 2026-09-01)

**His words:** *"Go ahead with 8.8 MB."*

## 21. The v1 start screen — `round-6.4/v5`, finished in `round-11.1` (CEO, 2026-09-01)

He named Constellation as the v1 start screen.

### Typeface — Newsreader and Inter, APPROVED (CEO, 2026-09-01)

Both faces are approved for the product. A monospaced face is mentioned once
here and nowhere else, and nobody has ruled on which one.

### The splash screens — TWO, and the order is DETERMINISTIC (CEO, 2026-09-01)

**His words:** *"I have never approved more than 2 splash screens. The other
MOCKUP DESIGNS ARE NOT READY FOR USE IN SPLASH SCREENS YET."*

First start goes to number one, second to number two, and every start after
that back to number one.

### The logo — APPROVED (CEO, 2026-09-01)

**His words, on opening the wordmark sheet: "OK, go!"** The dark-mode and
light-mode marks are approved and are the assets the product uses.

The defect this closed was one bug in three places: the swoosh was a knock-out,
a hole rather than a color. A hole shows whatever is behind it, which is why
the mark rendered monochrome everywhere at once. The swoosh is painted now, so
each mark carries its own two tones on any ground, and the swoosh measures
7.68:1 dark and 3.49:1 light.

### A DESIGN SYSTEM — ruled (CEO, 2026-09-01)

Ten rules want a monospaced face and none is vendored. The logo lives in it.

## 22. Type — the app ships its own fonts, and relies on NO system font

The app vendors every face it uses.

# Open items — what is actually outstanding

## 1. Waiting on the CEO — a decision

**1.7** (the start screen) is CLOSED 2026-09-01 — he named Constellation.

## 3. Blocked on Rich

| # | Item | State |
| 3.13 | **Delete the ACP adapter — CLOSED 2026-09-01.** The adapter is gone. | `CLOSED` |
| 3.14 | **RULED 2026-09-01 — ship nothing extra, 8.8 MB.** His words: *"Go ahead with 8.8 MB."* What ships is four files. **His option D, 2026-08-31: detect at install or first run whether Claude Code is present, and download and install it if not.** It is not a new idea in this project — it is his own standing instruction (*"automatically download and install whatever the user needs"*), quoted at the head of the payload design. | `CLOSED` |

# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THIS SECTION IS FOR — AND THE PIN THAT WAS TAKEN OUT OF IT
# ===========================================================================
# Sections 1-7 run against a fixture that was SHAPED so the answers come out
# right: sixty lines, arranged so that "logo" reads as vocabulary and "swoosh"
# reads as a subject. That proves the MECHANISM, and it cannot prove the
# mechanism survives a real register — 67 rulings, roughly 1,400 lines, real
# term frequencies. That is what this section is for, and it is the only place
# in the suite that touches anything real:
#
#   NO FALSE NEGATIVE AT SCALE   the three questions that were the actual
#                                failure of 2026-09-01 are still refused when
#                                the haystack is the whole register, and the
#                                refusal is USABLE — it points at a line that
#                                exists and quotes what is written there.
#   NO FALSE POSITIVE AT SCALE   the one question nobody had ruled on still
#                                passes, against 1,400 lines of vocabulary.
#
# UNTIL 2026-09-04 CASE 8a ALSO ASSERTED **WHICH** RULING DID THE REFUSING: it
# grepped the refusal for the string "row 3.14". It went red — and not because
# anything broke. The gate refused, with rc=2, citing §19, the payload ruling,
# which is a better citation than the one the case demanded. What moved was the
# record: open-items.md retired row 3.14 on 2026-09-02 in "eight finished rows
# leave the page", which is ordinary maintenance of the kind
# guard-row-currency-commits.sh exists to DEMAND. A suite that goes red because
# the CEO's record was correctly maintained is a suite that gets ignored on the
# day it is right.
#
# WHICH ruling answers a question is a fact about the record's contents at one
# moment. It is not a property of the predicate. So the citation is no longer
# pinned by name, and two mechanical properties that cannot drift with content
# took its place — both of them things the old case never checked at all:
#
#   THE LOCATOR RESOLVES        every "in <file>, line <N>" the refusal prints
#                               has to land on a line that really carries the
#                               title printed above it. A refusal is worth
#                               something only as a pointer, and nothing until
#                               now checked that it pointed anywhere.
#   THE QUOTE IS THE RECORD'S   every quoted line has to be findable in the
#                               file it was attributed to — six consecutive
#                               words after normalization, because the renderer
#                               unwraps paragraphs, strips markdown and
#                               truncates at 400 characters. A refusal that
#                               invents his words is worse than no refusal.
#
# THIS IS WEAKER IN EXACTLY ONE PLACE AND THE PLACE IS NAMED: nothing here
# asserts any longer that the cited ruling is ABOUT the question. That claim is
# made against the fixture, where the record is fixed and the claim therefore
# means something — cases 1a-1f make it, and the negative controls of section 3
# prove each one load-bearing by taking the matching signal away. Case 8d is
# what stops a gate that refuses everything from passing this section, and
# scripts/hooks/ceo-ruled.mutation.sh turns every case here red by breaking the
# gate, one property at a time.
#
# When the live record is not on this machine, THAT IS SAID, not passed over —
# a suite that reported green for a check it never ran is the failure mode this
# whole mechanism exists for.
#
# CEO_RULED_LIVE_DIR redirects the search at a copy of the register. It exists
# for the drift demonstration in the mutation harness, which renumbers and
# retitles the record and requires this section to stay green, so that "this no
# longer depends on which row answers" is measured rather than asserted.
