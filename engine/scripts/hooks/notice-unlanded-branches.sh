# notice-unlanded-branches.sh — NON-BLOCKING Stop hook. A TURN DOES NOT END
#                               QUIETLY WHILE FINISHED WORK SITS ON A BRANCH
#                               THAT MAIN HAS NEVER SEEN.
#
# The predicate, the measured narrowings, the liveness rule and what this
# cannot see are all in scripts/lib/unlanded-branches.py. Read that first — it
# is the analysis half. This file is the wiring and the one sentence.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE INCIDENT
# ===========================================================================
# 2026-09-06. A session ended reporting "Everything is clean and pushed" while
# SIX finished branches sat outside main, one of them the fix for the CEO's own
# complaint that the app steals keyboard focus. Both checks that session ran
# were green AND CORRECT — the working tree was clean, and `main` did match
# `origin/main`. Neither of those two facts can see an unlanded branch, and
# between them they are the whole vocabulary of the word "clean".
#
# Fifty-nine seconds earlier the same session had NAMED two of those branches
# by hand inside escalation acknowledgments, and closed an item citing a signoff
# file that existed only on an unmerged branch. The information was not missing.
# Nothing was standing at the turn end asking for it.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY IT REPORTS AND DOES NOT BLOCK
# ===========================================================================
# `Stop` CAN block — that is measured, and guard-idle-land.sh uses it. This one
# deliberately does not, for the reason notice-unstarted-rows.sh gives one event
# over: "there is unlanded work" is a FACT, and "therefore you should not have
# stopped" is a judgment this hook does not have. A turn that ends to ask the
# CEO a question, ends because he interrupted, or ends in the middle of a land
# is a turn ending correctly with branches outstanding. Refusing those would
# make this a thing to switch off, and a guard people disable protects nothing.
#
# ===========================================================================
# SIGNAL QUALITY IS THE WHOLE JOB — the numbers are in the analyzer
# ===========================================================================
# Measured on this machine on 2026-09-06: 201 local branches across five
# repositories, 3 with commits main does not contain, 2 that no live worktree
# holds. A notice keyed on "a branch exists" would have named 201 and been
# muted within a day. The narrowings and the commands that produced every one of
# those numbers are in scripts/lib/unlanded-branches.py; they are not repeated
# here, because a number in two places is a number that will disagree with
# itself.
#
# The two it names today are real: the `BLOCKED.md` escalations of 2026-09-02,
# still outside main four days later.
#
# ===========================================================================
# IT NEVER SAYS "CLEAR" ABOUT SOMETHING IT DID NOT READ
# ===========================================================================
# A repository with no recorded integration branch (point 14) cannot be
# answered for: "has this landed?" has no reference to be asked against, and
# the sweep abstains rather than assuming main. That abstention arrived here as
# `STATUS partial` with `N 0`, this file treated `partial` as a no-op, and the
# zero-findings branch printed:
#
#     UNLANDED-BRANCH WATCH: clear again
#
# over a fixture holding one unlanded `cc/` branch. Neither repository this
# engine governs has a branch recorded, so that was the live state.
#
# The sweep now carries the abstention in fields of its own (NOTEXAMINED, UKEY,
# UNEXAMINED) and this hook announces it in the words its sibling
# land-completeness.sh already uses for the same fact: NOT EXAMINED. Two
# surfaces over one abstention are not allowed two vocabularies, and neither of
# them is allowed the word "clear".
#
# ===========================================================================
# ONE LINE, STATE-CHANGE DE-DUPLICATED
# ===========================================================================
# systemMessage via scripts/lib/stop-hook-notice.sh, the only channel measured
# to reach the operator (that file carries the table). The state key is the SET
# of findings including each tip SHA, so: a persistent set is announced once, a
# NEW branch going unlanded speaks again, a branch being landed speaks again
# (the set changed), and an agent adding a commit to an already-reported branch
# speaks again — deliberately, because that is new work now at risk.
#
# ===========================================================================
# LAYER R CHECKS THIS HOOK, AND NOBODY HAD TO REMEMBER TO SAY SO
# ===========================================================================
# This section used to read: contract-integrity-probe.sh carries a TYPED list
# (R_ROOTED_HOOKS) of the hooks whose root bootstrap it holds byte-identical,
# this hook is absent from it because that file belonged to another engineer
# when this was written, nothing goes red as a result, please add it.
#
# SETTLED 2026-09-14, AND THE WAY IT WAS SETTLED IS THE POINT. It was added to
# the list on 2026-09-06 with the merge — and four other rooted hooks that made
# the same note were not, so Layer R was walking 52 of the 57 registered hooks
# that resolve a root and one of them was already carrying a divergent
# bootstrap. A note asking a future reader to update an inventory is not a
# mitigation for that; it is the same bet placed politely. Layer R now DERIVES
# the hooks it walks from hooks/hooks.json, so this hook is checked because it
# is registered, and the only way out of the check is an explicit entry in
# R_ROOTLESS_HOOKS. The block below is a byte-exact copy of the canonical one,
# which is now an enforced property rather than a promise.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHEN IT TAKES EFFECT
# ===========================================================================
# Hooks snapshot at session start. Installing this changes NOTHING in the
# session that installs it — it begins reporting in the NEXT session. Verify it
# is live after a restart with:
#     scripts/hooks/notice-unlanded-branches.sh --self-test
# and by checking the engine-status banner's registered-hook count.
#
# Exit codes: always 0. This hook never refuses a turn.

# --- ROOT RESOLUTION -------------------------------------------------------
# TWO ROOTS, NEVER ONE. The full contract, and why the old single-root
# resolution was wrong the moment the engine became loadable by reference,
# is in scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. This bootstrap block is byte-identical
# in every hook that needs a root; contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R asserts
# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
#
# THE BANNER BELOW GOES OUT ON TWO CHANNELS AND ONLY THE SECOND IS HEARD.
# Measured on Claude Code 2.1.270 (macOS, 2026-09-14) by registering one probe
# hook per channel on five events at once and reading the transcript back:
#
#   channel, exit 0     SessionStart  UserPromptSubmit  PreToolUse  PostToolUse  Stop
#   stderr              silent        silent            silent      silent       silent
#   stdout, plain text  model         model             silent      silent       silent
#   {"systemMessage"}   PERSON        PERSON            PERSON      PERSON       PERSON
#   additionalContext   model         model             model       model        model
#
# `silent` is not shorthand: the host records a `hook_success` attachment
# carrying the text in its stderr field and renders it to NO ONE. So a hook
# that could not find its own engine announced a dead enforcement layer
# exactly as loudly as a clean pass. Of the 60 files carrying this block, 35
# exit 2 here — where the host does render stderr, as the refusal reason — and
# 24 exit 0 and were inaudible. The 24 are the notices and observers, which is
# the trap: the hooks that must never block are the hooks nobody could hear.
#
# WHY `systemMessage` AND NOT `additionalContext`. additionalContext must name
# its own event in the envelope, and this block is identical in hooks
# registered on eight different events — it cannot know which one it is on.
# `systemMessage` is event-agnostic and it reaches the operator rather than
# only the model, which is the right audience for "your guards are off".
# Measured too: adding it to an exit-2 hook leaves the refusal untouched —
# same `hook error:` tool result, same blocked write — and only adds a render.
# Nothing here changes what any hook detects, refuses, or exits with.
#
# The escaping is deliberately pure bash (verified on 3.2.57, the macOS system
# shell) and calls nothing external: this is the one code path in the engine
# that runs when the install is already known to be broken, so it must not
# depend on python3, jq, or any file it has just failed to find.
