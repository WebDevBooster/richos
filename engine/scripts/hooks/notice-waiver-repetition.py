"""notice-waiver-repetition.py — A HATCH USED OVER AND OVER IS A BROKEN GUARD.

===========================================================================
THE DEFECT THIS FILE EXISTS TO END
===========================================================================
Measured on 2026-09-02, in ONE day, in one repository:

    .claude/state/resume-acks.log       228 entries
    .claude/state/ceo-todos-defers.log   23 entries

251 waivers, every one of them written by the lead, every one individually
justified and true on its own terms.

The 228 are the diagnostic ones. guard-resume-isolation.sh resolved a
teammate's liveness from the session roster, and the roster NEVER lists a
background isolation agent. So every message to a live background agent
tripped the guard — a 100% false-positive rate on the normal case — and every
one was answered with a `resume-ack:` line. That went on for weeks. The guard
was then fixed in about an hour, and only after the CEO asked how many more
times he would have to hear about it.

Nothing had decayed. Zero guards have ever been deleted from this engine; 47
guard and notice scripts are present and wired. The engine's own doctrine
already names the failure — habitual waiving is how a defense decays into a
formality — written in a file the lead reads, while he was doing it 228 times.

SO THE DEFECT IS NOT COVERAGE AND IT IS NOT DECAY. A waiver costs nothing, so
it is always cheaper than the fix. Nothing ever put the price of the 229th
waiver next to the price of the fix.

===========================================================================
WHY A REPORT IS THE MECHANISM HERE, AND NOT A CONSOLATION PRIZE
===========================================================================
The standing bar in this engine is that a deliverable which only reports,
warns or counts has FAILED, unless the report itself is the mechanism. This
one is, and the argument is specific rather than convenient.

The waiver ledgers ALREADY CONTAINED THE ENTIRE PROOF. 226 distinct entries,
122 distinct recipients, 27 distinct days, all in one file, all readable by
`wc -l`. Nothing was hidden and nothing was missing. What was missing was that
NO CODE AND NO HUMAN EVER READ THAT FILE. The escape hatches write; nobody
reads. So the intervention that changes the outcome is not a new rule — the
rule exists and was ignored — it is the arithmetic, performed automatically,
on the operator's screen, at the end of the turn in which he is about to write
waiver number 229.

WHY IT MUST NOT BLOCK, stated as a design decision rather than timidity. The
act it would block is the WAIVER, and in every case measured here the waiver
was the CORRECT act: the teammate really was alive, the message really had to
go. Refusing it would punish the operator for a DIFFERENT guard's false
positive and wedge the session — which is exactly guard-inflight-notify.sh's
own reasoning one event over ("blocking a land until another party acts is how
a guard wedges a session"; THE SEND IS ENFORCED, THE ACK IS SURFACED). Worse,
a blocking waiver-watcher would itself need an escape hatch, and by this
file's own thesis that hatch would be waived 228 times. A defense whose
failure mode is to recreate the defect it was built for is not a defense.

AND SO THIS ONE HAS NO ESCAPE HATCH AT ALL. There is no marker, no config key,
no `waiver-repetition-ack:` line. An opt-out on the thing that watches opt-outs
is self-evidently absurd, and its absence is the reason this notice cannot go
the way of the 228.

===========================================================================
WHAT COUNTS AS A DEFECT — the rule, and the real numbers behind it
===========================================================================
A hatch used ONCE is a considered exception and this file says nothing about
it, ever. The question is when repetition stops being a series of exceptions
and starts being a guard with a false-positive class. The rule is:

    THE SAME REASON, GIVEN FOR A SET OF INDEPENDENT ACTS, AT LEAST 3 TIMES,
    STILL HAPPENING NOW.

Independence has two observable forms in these ledgers — different days, or
different subjects. Either way the operator restated the same justification
for a case the guard had already gotten wrong at least once, and chose the
waiver over the fix again.

Every constant below was read off the real ledgers, not picked round.

MIN_CLASS = 3.
    Pooling every class in the six ledgers that exist today, class sizes run
    1 (x38), 2 (x5), 3 (x3), 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 15, 16, 20, 26, 35, 36, 42, 74,
    79, 86, 88, 143. There is no gap at the bottom to hide behind, so the
    floor is argued rather than fitted: one is an exception, two is that
    exception recurring, and the THIRD is the first use at which the operator
    can no longer claim surprise — the guard demonstrably has a CLASS of cases
    it gets wrong, and writing a fourth waiver is a choice to keep paying.
    Dropping to 2 would add 5 classes totalling 10 entries to a report whose
    real content is 800+; raising to 4 would delete a live ceo-todos-defers
    class the data shows is real. 3 also keeps the required quiet side: one
    considered waiver, and two, say nothing.

JACCARD = 0.35, single-linkage, on identifier-stripped content words.
    Exact text matching is useless here and that is measured: the 228
    resume-acks contain 226 DISTINCT strings, and the largest byte-identical
    group is 7. The same reason gets retyped in different words every time.
    Sensitivity, measured on resume-acks.log (226 unique entries):

        0.25 ->  6 classes, largest 221   (over-merges: swallows the
                                           in-flight-land-notice class, which
                                           is a different guard interaction)
        0.35 -> 16 classes, largest  88   CHOSEN
        0.45 -> 25 classes, largest  53   (fragments one class into four)
        0.55 -> 29 classes, largest  53

    THE VERDICT IS THE SAME AT ALL FOUR. Every ledger flagged at 0.35 is
    flagged at 0.25, 0.45 and 0.55; only the sizes move. So the constant is
    not load-bearing, and notice-waiver-repetition.test.sh asserts exactly
    that, so a future edit cannot quietly make it load-bearing.

ACTIVE_DAYS = 14.
    A guard that HAS BEEN FIXED must stop being reported, or this notice
    becomes the muted line the engine already refused to ship. So a class
    counts only while it is still being used. The window is where it is
    because of a hole in the real data: sorting every qualifying class by days
    since its last use gives

        0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7, 8,  ... then nothing until 29,
        then 46, 50, 110, 115, 115, 116, 116, 118, 128, 128, 128, 129, 131,
        131, 132, 132, 132, 133

    Live work and dead history are separated by a 21-day void. ANY window from
    9 to 28 days produces the identical live set on today's data, which is the
    definition of a constant that is not tuned. 14 sits in the middle of that
    void.

===========================================================================
HOW THE LEDGERS ARE FOUND — derived from the guards, checked against disk
===========================================================================
There is NO TYPED LIST OF LEDGERS in this file. A typed inventory is precisely
the thing that falls behind: scripts/lib/registered-hooks.sh exists because a
typed list of guards drifted twice in two days, and scripts/lib/sandbox-
completeness.sh exists because a typed list of sandbox files left Layer K green
over a scanner that never ran.

But sandbox-completeness.sh also states the counter-argument, and it applies
here: A SCAN THAT STOPS MATCHING PRODUCES A SHORTER LIST, SILENTLY, and a
shorter list makes every report cleaner. So the discovery is TWO-SIDED, and
neither side can shorten the other:

  SOURCE SIDE — every .sh/.py under the engine's scripts/ is read for an
    APPEND SITE (a `>>` redirect, an append_log call, or a Python "a" open)
    whose target resolves to a *.log / *.jsonl basename, locally first and
    then engine-wide for the shared `*_LOG_NAME` convention. An append site is
    an ESCAPE-HATCH ledger when hatch vocabulary (ack / waive / exempt /
    bypass / defer / opt-out / escape hatch / override / allowed) appears in
    its immediate context. That vocabulary is a list of ENGLISH WORDS, not a
    list of files — it generalizes to a hatch that does not exist yet, which
    is the whole difference. Finding ZERO hatch ledgers is a hard failure, not
    an all-clear.

  DISK SIDE — the entity's .claude/state and every teams directory are listed.
    For the question this file asks, the disk side is COMPLETE BY
    CONSTRUCTION: a hatch that has never been used has no file, and a hatch
    that has never been used cannot have been used repeatedly. Any *.log /
    *.jsonl found there that the source side does not claim is reported as
    UNATTRIBUTED rather than dropped — that is the line where a broken deriver
    becomes visible instead of quiet.

WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE, said here rather than in a postmortem. It reads the
ledgers the hatches write. A hatch that writes NOTHING is invisible to it, and
so is a guard that is being satisfied by theater rather than by a marker. It
also cannot judge whether a reason is TRUE; it only observes that the same one
was given for independent acts and that the guard was not changed.

WHERE IT IS KNOWN TO BE WRONG TODAY, and in which direction. On the engine as
it stands, `definition-drift.log` is classified as a hatch and is not one: it
records agent creations, and the hatch vocabulary appears near its append site
because the REAL hatch, definition-drift-acks.log, is written eleven lines away
in the same guard. The consequence is that four ancient rows are read and
reported as a hatch that has never fired, which is visible in the lint output
and costs one line. That is the direction the classifier is built to fail in:
an over-classified record is a line the operator can dismiss, while an
under-classified hatch is a defect nobody is told about. The engine has already
ruled on this trade — degrading toward noise is recoverable by an operator who
can read it; degrading toward silence rebuilds the defect.
