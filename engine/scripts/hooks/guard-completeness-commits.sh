# guard-completeness-commits.sh — BLOCKING PreToolUse guard on the Bash tool.
#
# Makes the PUBLICATION COMPLETENESS contract fire on its own, at `git commit`
# and at `git push`, instead of waiting for somebody to remember it.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
# ===========================================================================
# scripts/publication-completeness.sh answers the question the leak guards
# cannot:
#
#       IS EVERYTHING THAT MUST BE THERE, THERE — AND USABLE BY SOMEONE WHO
#       HAS ONLY THE PUBLIC REPOSITORY?
#
# It was built on 2026-08-29, it is correct, and it was wired into exactly two
# places: CI, and an operator's memory. Ten guards in this engine fire at
# PreToolUse without being asked. This check did not, and on 2026-08-30 the
# difference was measured in the only way that counts:
#
#   THE CONTRACT WAS RED ON `main` AND NOBODY KNEW.
#
# docs/measurements/correction-flywheel-2026-08-29/README.md cited
# `docs/plans/richos-techy-mode-2026-08-26.md`, a file that lives only in the
# private record. A reader with nothing but the public repository was being
# sent to a file they will never have. It was committed on a branch, merged to
# main, and pushed. After the merge the lander ran the test suites — because
# the suites are what he remembered — and not the completeness check, because
# nothing made him. It sat on main until an unrelated question happened to
# surface it. Every individual step was done carefully. The defect is not
# carelessness; it is that
#
#   A CHECK THAT RUNS WHEN SOMEONE REMEMBERS IS A RULE ENFORCED BY ATTENTION,
#   AND ATTENTION IS THE THING THIS ENGINE KEEPS PROVING IT CANNOT BUY.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHERE IT FIRES, AND WHY BOTH
# ===========================================================================
# `git commit` AND `git push`. Its two sibling contract guards fire only on
# commit; this one needs the second arm, and the reason is specific rather than
# belt-and-braces.
#
#   COMMIT is where the claim is AUTHORED. Run against the branch the flywheel
#   README was written on, the commit is refused at the moment the author can
#   still fix it in one keystroke, before it is anybody else's problem. This is
#   also the arm that catches content no Write tool ever touched — `sed -i`, a
#   heredoc, a generator, a rename — which is 137-of-140 of the way real files
#   arrive here, measured by guard-publication-commits.sh's own header.
#
#   PUSH is where the claim becomes PUBLIC, and it is the only arm that can see
#   a MERGE. `git merge` creates a commit without running `git commit`, so the
#   commit arm never sees one; guard-publication-commits.sh names that gap and
#   accepts it, correctly, because the BYTES a merge carries were already gated
#   on the source branch. Completeness is not a property of bytes. It is a
#   property of the WHOLE TREE, and a merge can manufacture a defect that
#   exists on neither side of it: branch A moves a file, branch B cites the old
#   path, both commit clean, the merge is broken. That is precisely "a claim
#   that went stale because something else moved", and no per-commit check of
#   either branch can ever see it.
#
#   The asymmetry with the boundary guard is deliberate and it is about the
#   COST OF THE REMEDY, not about severity. Private bytes in history need a
#   rewrite and a force-push, so the boundary must refuse before they exist and
#   a push-time check would arrive too late to help. A dangling citation in
#   history needs a follow-up commit. So gating the push is cheap, useful, and
#   the last chokepoint before a public reader can hit it — which is exactly
#   where today's miss escaped.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE WHOLE TREE, EVERY TIME — MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED
# ===========================================================================
# The obvious economy is to check only what the commit touches. It was
# rejected on the measurement, and the measurement is the argument. richos
# @ 6d835be, 589 tracked files, 171 .md/.txt, best-of-5 end to end:
#
#   a Bash call that is neither a commit nor a push          0.014s
#   a commit in femcboost / richos-hq (stand-down)           0.076s
#   a bare commit in richos (full whole-tree check)          0.288s
#   `git add -A && git commit` (+ the scratch index)         0.302s
#   a push in richos (full whole-tree check)                 0.275s
#     of which the predicate itself is                       0.20s
#   guard-publication-commits.sh here, for comparison        0.091s
#
# A scoped check would have bought roughly nothing and cost the only thing that
# matters here. THREE OF THE FOUR CHECKS ARE NOT DIFFABLE EVEN IN PRINCIPLE:
#
#   * a citation goes stale when the file it names MOVES — the commit that
#     breaks it does not touch the citing document at all;
#   * "shipped inert" is a claim about the whole tree's onboarding set, so
#     deleting one README paragraph anywhere breaks it;
#   * a mechanism left behind in the private tree is not in the diff by
#     definition — it is in the OTHER repository.
#
# Scoping to the diff would have produced a guard that passes the commit that
# introduces the defect and never mentions it again. At three tenths of a second
# there is no trade to make, so none is made, and this guard has no "what a
# scoped check cannot catch" section because it is not scoped.
#
# COST DISCIPLINE, so this stays true on a tree ten times the size: the guard
# times itself and, past COMPLETENESS_SOFT_BUDGET_S, says so on stderr EVEN WHEN
# IT PASSES. Nobody has to discover that the guard has become the slowest thing
# in their commit; the guard reports it. If it ever exceeds the hooks.json
# timeout the host kills it, and a killed hook is a SILENT one — which is the
# defect this file exists to remove, so the advisory fires at a fraction of the
# timeout rather than at it.
#
# ===========================================================================
# `git add -A && git commit` IS ONE BASH CALL, AND THE HOOK RUNS FIRST
# ===========================================================================
# This is not a detail; it is the difference between this guard working and
# this guard being decorative, and it was found by writing the suite rather
# than by reading. A PreToolUse hook fires BEFORE the command, so in the
# dominant commit idiom here — stage and commit in one call — the new files are
# still UNTRACKED at decision time. `git ls-files` does not list them. The
# checker is right to define the published tree as what git tracks, and reading
# it naively at that instant audits the tree MINUS everything the commit is
# about to add.
#
# THE FLYWHEEL README WAS A NEW FILE. Read naively, this guard would have
# reported today's defect clean and let it through — the failure it exists to
# prevent, wearing the costume of a green tick.
#
# So when the command stages, the checker is handed a SCRATCH INDEX with the
# staging already applied. See "THE TREE THAT IS ABOUT TO EXIST" below for how,
# and for why a failure to build that view refuses rather than falls back.
#
# NOTED, BECAUSE IT IS NOT MINE TO FIX HERE: guard-publication-commits.sh reads
# `git diff --cached` at the same instant, so on `git add -A && git commit` it
# sees an EMPTY staged set and exits 0. That is the LEAK guard — the one that
# refuses private material — and the hole is in the same place for the same
# reason. It is reported in this branch's handoff rather than patched, because
# that file is being edited by another agent this session and a blind cross-edit
# is how two correct fixes become one broken merge.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE COST THIS DOES IMPOSE, STATED PLAINLY
# ===========================================================================
# A whole-tree gate means AN UNRELATED COMMIT CAN BE BLOCKED BY A FINDING
# SOMEBODY ELSE LEFT. That is the same trade guard-ceo-todos-commits.sh makes
# and for the same reason: the original failure was not a bad line being
# written, it was a bad line SITTING there while everyone read past it. So the
# refusal says which findings this change is implicated in and which were
# already there, and it never pretends the second kind are the author's fault.
#
# THERE IS NO DEADLOCK, and that was checked rather than hoped: the checker
# reads `git ls-files` (the INDEX — so a staged fix counts) and the WORKTREE's
# bytes (so an edited fix counts). Fixing the citation, adding the missing
# file, or writing a reviewed line into `.publication-completeness` all make
# the very next commit pass. A guard you cannot commit your way out of would be
# removed within the day, and would deserve to be.
#
# NO LIVE OVERRIDE — deliberately, and for its siblings' reason: what failed
# was in-the-moment judgement about whether a particular claim was really
# backed. An in-prompt escape token would rebuild exactly that. The way through
# is `.publication-completeness` — committed, diffable, reviewed by whoever
# lands it, and self-expiring, because an exemption that suppresses nothing is
# itself a failure.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THIS CANNOT CATCH
# ===========================================================================
# Everything scripts/publication-completeness.sh cannot catch, unchanged — that
# list lives in ONE place, in that file's header, and is not copied here. Add
# the four this chokepoint contributes:
#
#   * A merge, a cherry-pick, an `am` or a rebase in a repository nobody then
#     pushes. Merge is covered in practice because the land sequence pushes; a
#     merge left unpushed is not.
#   * A commit or push from a session this engine does not govern, or from
#     outside any session at all. Same hole every hook in this family has.
#   * The PUSH arm checks the CURRENT WORKING TREE, not the refs being pushed.
#     `git push origin some-other-branch` from a checkout of main audits main.
#     Reading the pushed ref would mean checking out a tree behind the
#     operator's back, which is a worse thing to do than to have this gap.
#   * A capability with NO DECLARATION FILE AT ALL is invisible to the checker
#     by construction, so it is invisible here too — automating a check does
#     not widen it. richos-hq/RICH-TODOs.md is a live instance: an operator
#     backlog with no template, no contract and no gate, and this guard changes
#     nothing about it. It is queued separately, and it is the one hole a
#     reader of this file should leave still knowing about.
#
# PRECISION: fires only on a command that actually contains `git commit` or
# `git push`, and only in a repository that has declared itself publication-
# bound. A repository with no `.publication-boundary` — which is every
# repository on this machine except one — is untouched, at the cost of a
# substring test.

# was. `-A` is used rather than replaying the command's own pathspecs because
# re-executing fragments of somebody's command line is a worse idea than being
# slightly over-inclusive, and the over-inclusion is honest: an untracked,
# un-ignored file in a published repository is a file on its way in. It also
# picks up the reverse case, which is the subtler one — `rm docs/x.md` followed
# by `git commit -a` leaves x.md in the real index, so a citation of it would
# still "resolve" against a file that is being deleted.
