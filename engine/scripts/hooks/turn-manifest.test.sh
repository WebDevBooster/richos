#
# turn-manifest.test.sh — regression tests for the Stop-time TURN MANIFEST
# (scripts/hooks/turn-manifest.sh + .py).
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS DEFENDING
#   The manifest's whole value is that its rows are GENERATED from what each
#   tool returned. Every way it could stop being that is a way it becomes a
#   second, more convincing version of the failure it was built to end — a
#   reassuring list that does not describe reality. So the cases below are
#   organized around the four ways that happens: wrong scope, silent
#   truncation, a gap that reads as an absence, and a fixture that proves
#   nothing.
#
#   richos is a public repository. Every fixture reproduces the SHAPE of a
#   real record with invented content; the one exception is the SendMessage
#   result string, which is the tool's own product text and is reproduced
#   because reproducing it exactly IS the test.
#
# Covers:
#   THE POSITIVE CONTROL — the actual failing case
#     (a)  SendMessage returned "Message queued …"  -> the row says queued
#     (a2) …and the manifest does NOT render its success flag as the status
#     (a3) the assistant's own words never enter the manifest
#   THE EMPTY TURN, AND THE GAP THAT MUST NOT LOOK LIKE ONE
#     (b)  zero tool calls -> an EXPLICIT "0 tool calls", never a blank render
#          (the "dispatching it" failure had zero calls; a blank would hide it)
#     (b2) unreadable transcript -> UNAVAILABLE, and NOT "0 tool calls"
#     (b3) absent prompt_id -> UNAVAILABLE, and NOT "0 tool calls"
#   PER-TURN SCOPING — pinned with ONLY the call's position moving
#     (c)  one fixture, one variable: the same Glob call before vs after the
#          turn's prompt record. Before -> absent. After -> present.
#     (c2) an earlier turn's result never pairs with this turn's call
#     (c3) subagent (isSidechain) traffic is never reported as the
#          orchestrator's own
#   STATUSES COME FROM THE RESULTS
#     (d)  is_error -> ERROR + the result's own first line
#     (d2) no matching tool_result -> NO RESULT
#     (d3) plain output -> ok + a measured size
#   TRUNCATION IS ANNOUNCED
#     (e)  40 calls -> 25 rows, header tallies all 40, omission line names the
#          count and the dropped tally
#     (e2) a truncated row says how many characters were removed
#     (e3) a SendMessage past the row cap is STILL visible in the header tally
#   THE NEGATIVE CONTROL
#     (f)  the observation record's records_examined equals the fixture's exact
#          record count — so this suite cannot pass by rendering convincingly
#          from an empty transcript. This session found a scanner reporting
#          CLEAN over an empty corpus and a reporting layer dead for weeks;
#          this case is why there will not be a third.
#     (f2) an empty transcript really does examine 0 records (proves f can
#          distinguish the two, rather than passing on any number)
#   IT NEVER BLOCKS, AND NEVER WEDGES A SESSION
#     (g)  every single case above exits 0 — asserted globally at the end
#     (g2) stop_hook_active -> exit 0, renders NOTHING (cannot loop on itself)
#     (g3) repository has not adopted the engine -> exit 0, renders nothing
#     (g4) unparseable payload -> exit 0
#     (g5) broken install (resolve-roots.sh absent) -> exit 0
#     (g6) SHOW_TURN_MANIFEST=0 -> exit 0 + a VISIBLE stand-down, because a
#          stand-down nobody can see is a defense that decays into a rumour
#   THE OUTPUT CONTRACT
#     (h)  whenever it renders, stdout is valid JSON carrying systemMessage
#          and suppressOutput — the only shape the host will show the operator
#
# Run directly: scripts/hooks/turn-manifest.test.sh
# Exit 0 = all pass; exit 1 = at least one failure.
