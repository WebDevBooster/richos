# guard-vendoring-commits.sh — BLOCKING PreToolUse guard on the Bash tool.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
# ===========================================================================
# On 2026-09-04 a pre-publication audit asked this repository a question it
# could not answer: for each of the 27 skills under `engine/skills/`, did
# RichOS write it?
#
#   FIFTEEN DID NOT COME FROM RICHOS. EXACTLY ONE OF THE FIFTEEN HAD EVER BEEN
#   WRITTEN DOWN AS VENDORED, AND IT WAS WRITTEN DOWN IN A COMMIT MESSAGE.
#
# Establishing the other fourteen took a full agent fetching upstream
# repositories and comparing bytes. Two of the verdicts came back "high
# confidence" rather than certain, because by then the evidence had decayed —
# an upstream had renamed a skill, a history had been rewritten, an arrival
# commit had been squashed. Every one of those facts was KNOWN, for free, at
# the moment of vendoring, by the person doing it.
#
# The same missing fact produced a second, unrelated failure the same day.
# guard-dialect.sh Americanized four British spellings inside
# `engine/skills/copywriting/references/natural-transitions.md` — Corey
# Haines's MIT-licensed prose. That guard was working exactly as designed. It
# simply had no way to tell a vendored file from one we wrote, because nothing
# in this repository knew.
#
# The obvious response is a document, and the obvious response is wrong. A
# ledger a human is trusted to update IS the next thing an audit reconstructs:
# `docs/legal/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` already existed, already had an "Adding
# something new" section telling you to add a row, and fifteen skills reached a
# publication audit anyway. Every rule in this engine that survived is a rule
# with a write-time or commit-time chokepoint; every rule left to attention
# decayed, usually within days.
#
# So the recording is UNSKIPPABLE: a commit that adds files under a path
# holding redistributable material, with no entry in `.richos/vendored-material`
# covering them, is REFUSED, and the refusal names the path and the line to add.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE ONE QUESTION IT ASKS, AND THE ONE IT REFUSES TO
# ===========================================================================
# IT ASKS: was this fact written down?
#
# IT DOES NOT ASK, AND MUST NEVER ASK: is this file third-party? A guard that
# inferred provenance — from a license header, from prose style, from an
# absent git history — would be confidently wrong some of the time, and a
# confidently wrong provenance claim is worse than an absent one: the absent
# one prompts a check. The 2026-09-04 audit is what inference costs when it is
# done properly, by a whole agent, with upstream repositories in hand. This
# guard has none of that and pretends to none of it.
#
# The consequence, stated so nobody is surprised by it: registering something
# is not a claim that it is correctly registered. `origin`, `license` and
# `revision` are checked for SHAPE and never for TRUTH. What the guard
# guarantees is that a person looked at the question at the moment they had the
# answer, and wrote down what they found.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHERE IT FIRES, AND WHY ONLY THERE
# ===========================================================================
# `git commit`, against the STAGED INDEX — the same subject and the same reason
# as guard-publication-commits.sh: vendoring is `git add` followed by
# `git commit`, and the index is where the bytes are by then, whether a Write
# tool touched them or a `curl | tar` did. A PreToolUse[Write] guard would miss
# every vendoring that arrives as a download, which is most of them.
#
# NOT `git merge`, and that is deliberate rather than an omission. A merge
# carries commits that were already refused-or-permitted on the branch where
# the bytes first appeared; re-asking there would refuse a lander for a
# teammate's decision, at the one moment the lander cannot fix it. NOT
# `git push` either: nothing new arrives at a push.
#
# `--amend` widens the base to HEAD~1, because an amend rewrites the commit
# that is already there and its additions are additions again.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE ESCAPE HATCH
# ===========================================================================
#     vendoring-ack: <reason>
#
# on its own line in the COMMIT MESSAGE. Same idiom as `model-ceiling-ack:`,
# `main-checkout-run:` and `resume-ack:`, and the same rule: A BARE MARKER
# EXEMPTS NOTHING. The reason must be a real sentence, and it must not be a
# promise to do the recording later — "I'll add the entry afterwards" is not a
# reason, it is the exact behavior the registry exists to replace, and it is
# named in the refusal rather than silently accepted.
#
# Accepted uses are appended to `<repo>/.claude/state/vendoring-acks.log`, so a
# habit of typing the marker is visible as a habit rather than as one commit.
#

# FAILURE MODES
