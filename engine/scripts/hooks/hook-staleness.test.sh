# hook-staleness.test.sh — regression tests for the mid-session hook-staleness
# PAIR:
#   scripts/hooks/snapshot-enforcing-hooks.sh  (SessionStart baseline)
#   scripts/hooks/notice-hook-staleness.sh     (Stop notice)
#
# Every case runs against an isolated sandbox root (HOOK_STALENESS_ROOT) with a
# sandbox registration surface (HOOK_STALENESS_SURFACE), so the real repo's
# .claude/state and the real hooks/hooks.json are never written and never
# depended on.
#
# THE TWO PROPERTIES THAT MATTER MOST, AND WHY THEY ARE CASES RATHER THAN CLAIMS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   ZERO FALSE POSITIVES. A session in which the hook table did not change must
#   produce NOTHING — not a quiet OK, not an empty JSON object, nothing at all.
#   Cases 2, 2b, 2c and 8b assert byte-empty output under conditions that could
#   plausibly fool a weaker design: an unchanged table, a REORDERED table, an
#   edited guard BODY, and an edited settings surface. The last two are the
#   measured facts the whole design turns on — script bodies and settings hooks
#   both take effect immediately, so reporting either as "inert" would be a
#   false positive.
#
#   NEGATIVE CONTROLS. An empty corpus produces an empty delta, which is
#   indistinguishable from a clean run unless something checks. Cases 5a-5d
#   drive the baseline to zero rows, to a lying rows= header, to a foreign
#   engine, and to absent, and require the hook to say it CANNOT COMPARE rather
#   than pass quietly. Case 9 is the meta-control: it asserts the suite's own
#   "silent" assertion is load-bearing by breaking the hook and watching case 2
#   go red.
#
# Covers:
#   (1)  snapshotter writes a baseline: header, rows= count, latest symlink
#   (1b) baseline rows are DERIVED from the surface, not typed
#   (2)  unchanged table                       -> byte-empty output
#   (2b) REORDERED table, same set             -> byte-empty output
#   (2c) guard BODY edited mid-session         -> byte-empty (bodies are live)
#   (3)  guard landed mid-session              -> notice naming it, INERT, and
#                                                 RESTART as the operator's act
#   (3b) the three required statements are all present in the message
#   (4)  same drift a second time              -> silent (once per session)
#   (4b) drift GROWS                           -> speaks again, names both
#   (4c) drift shrinks back                    -> silent
#   (5a) baseline with zero rows               -> CANNOT CHECK
#   (5b) baseline whose rows= header lies      -> CANNOT CHECK
#   (5c) baseline from a different engine      -> CANNOT CHECK
#   (5d) no baseline at all                    -> CANNOT CHECK, naming restart
#   (5e) current surface unparseable           -> CANNOT CHECK
#   (6)  an already-wired script added to a NEW event -> reported as new wiring
#   (7)  a registration REMOVED mid-session    -> reported as still firing
#   (8)  not-adopted repository                -> byte-empty, always
#   (8b) the settings surface changing         -> byte-empty (it hot-reloads)
#   (9)  META: case 2's silence assertion is load-bearing
#   (10) never blocks: every case above exits 0
#   (11) BOTH registration surfaces carry the pair, verified by PARSING
#
# Run directly: scripts/hooks/hook-staleness.test.sh
# Exit 0 = all pass; exit 1 = at least one failure.
