"""guard-ci-turn-gate.py — THE TURN DOES NOT END WHILE THIS SESSION'S OWN PUSH
                            IS FAILING CI.

===========================================================================
WHAT THIS EXISTS FOR — AND THE QUESTION IT HAS TO MAKE ANSWERABLE
===========================================================================
On 2026-09-13 the founder posted three screenshots of red CI in one evening and
asked, twice:

    "HOW MANY MORE TIMES WILL I NEED TO POST SCREENSHOTS OF THAT CI?"

He was then given a promise. He asked the only question a promise cannot
answer: HOW WOULD HE KNOW the answer was zero? He could not, and that is the
whole defect.

The engine already reported red CI at SessionStart
(`session-start-ci-surface.sh`) and already made red cost something at a land
(`guard-ci-red-lands.sh`). Between them a workflow in richos-hq stayed red for
SIXTEEN DAYS, named in every single session-start banner, and nobody moved. A
report nobody is forced to read is not a mechanism; it is a promise with a
larger font.

This is the forcing function. It is the third leg and the only one that costs
the orchestrator something at the moment he is about to walk away: THE TURN
DOES NOT END.

===========================================================================
THE PREDICATE, AND WHY EVERY CLAUSE OF IT IS NARROW
===========================================================================
The lesson this project paid for with g11/g12/g13 — three blocking guards
built in one day, waived into uselessness by lunchtime — is that a guard dies
of FALSE POSITIVES, not of weakness. So the hold is a conjunction:

  1. THIS SESSION PUSHED. Derived from the transcript's own tool calls, not
     from a list somebody typed: a `git push` this session actually ran. A
     session that pushed nothing is never held, and cannot be.
  2. THE COMMIT IS THE ONE THAT WENT. Not "the repository is red" — the
     commit `git push` sent, read from the local `refs/remotes/origin/<branch>`
     that the push itself updated. Somebody else's red, on somebody else's
     commit, holds nothing here.
  3. GITHUB SAYS THAT COMMIT FAILED. A completed run whose conclusion is one
     of the not-green values. Not slow, not skipped, not never-run — those are
     real axes, they are reported in full by `ci-status.sh`, and gating on them
     is how a guard earns a reflexive waiver.
  4. AND THE LATEST PUSH WINS. Push a fix and the branch's newest commit is
     what gets judged; the broken one is superseded with no ceremony at all.

===========================================================================
THE CRUX: A RUN STILL IN PROGRESS DOES NOT HOLD THE TURN. IT HOLDS THE
OBLIGATION.
===========================================================================
This was the one real design decision and it has two wrong answers.

  BLOCK ON IN-PROGRESS, and the session is trapped for the length of the run.
  A twelve-shard suite is twenty minutes in which the orchestrator cannot hand
  the founder an answer. Within one day the ack becomes reflex, and a guard
  that is always acked protects nothing while costing a keystroke. Worse, it
  would be blocking on a fact it has NOT established — the same error as
  blocking because the network was down.

  IGNORE IN-PROGRESS, and the turn ends on a green-so-far verdict that turns
  red ninety seconds later. That is precisely the founder's screenshot.

So: THE TURN IS ALLOWED, THE OBLIGATION IS WRITTEN DOWN, AND EVERY LATER
TURN-END RE-READS IT. The obligation lives in a file keyed by (repository,
commit), outside the turn, and it does not expire when the turn does. Turn-ends
are the most frequent event in a session, and the founder is present at them,
so a verdict that arrives ninety seconds late costs ONE turn — against sixteen
days, which is what the alternative measured.

And the allowance is ANNOUNCED, never silent. "CI is still running on what this
session pushed, the turn is not held for it, the next turn-end reads the
verdict." The absence of a finding must be distinguishable from the absence of
a check; that rule is this engine's oldest, and an unannounced pass here would
break it.

===========================================================================
THE HARD TIME BUDGET — A NUMBER, NOT AN ADJECTIVE
===========================================================================
"It should be fast" is not something anybody can be held to. So the budget is a
named constant, it is enforced as a wall-clock deadline around every subprocess
this file starts, and ON EXPIRY THE TURN IS ALLOWED with the reason printed.

    BUDGET_SECONDS = 2.0

A check that cannot answer inside its budget must never hold the turn. Two
consequences worth stating plainly:

  * A repository read BEFORE the deadline still counts. If the first repository
    is established red and the second cannot be read in time, the turn is held
    for the first and the second is reported as unread. The gate refuses only
    on facts it established, and it never pretends the others were clean.
  * The steady state costs ZERO network. A commit whose runs are all completed
    and green can never change, so that reading is cached forever. In a session
    where nothing new is pushed, every turn-end after the first spends no API
    call at all. A RED reading is refreshed after RED_RECHECK_SECONDS, because
    `gh run rerun` is a real way out and a gate that could not see a re-run
    would be a gate you have to disable to escape.

===========================================================================
WHEN IT CANNOT LOOK, IT SAYS SO AND STANDS ASIDE
===========================================================================
GitHub unreachable, `gh` missing, a token expired, an aeroplane: none of that
is evidence of red. Blocking on it would refuse turns for reasons unrelated to
CI several times a week, and the fix on the day would always be to waive —
g11/g12/g13's death arrived at by a different road. The gate announces what it
could not read and the exact command that would answer it, and lets go.

===========================================================================
THE ESCAPE HATCH, AND WHY A BARE MARKER EXEMPTS NOTHING
===========================================================================
    ci-red-ack: <repository or workflow> — <why this cannot be fixed now>

on its own line in the turn's final message. It must NAME something that is
actually red in this finding; the reason must be a reason (a length floor, and
a refusal of the pure assertions — "fine", "known", "unrelated"); and it covers
ONE repository, so a second red repository still holds the turn and is named.
Every accepted ack is appended to a log, and the refusal prints how many times
this same repository has already been acked — which turns a habit into evidence
without blocking anybody's day.

The legitimate cases, written down so the hatch is not a mystery:
  * the failure is outside this session's changes (a dependency, a vendor
    outage, a workflow broken by an earlier landing);
  * the run can never complete (a removed runner, a workflow awaiting an
    approval nobody will give);
  * a deliberate hold — the fix is known, scheduled and the founder has been
    told.

Exit codes:
    0  the turn may end. stdout may carry ONE {"systemMessage": "..."} line.
    2  the turn is REFUSED. The refusal is on stderr.
    3  this file could not evaluate (the caller announces and allows).
