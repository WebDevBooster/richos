# snapshot-agent-definitions.sh — SessionStart hook. Records the sha256 of
# every `.claude/agents/*.md` teammate definition AS OF SESSION START, so the
# PreToolUse[Agent] partner guard (guard-definition-drift.sh) can prove, at
# spawn time, whether a definition has been installed/updated since the
# harness took its own snapshot.
#
# THE FAILURE MODE THIS PAIR EXISTS TO CLOSE (proven upstream, 2026-08-06):
#   Subagent definitions in `.claude/agents/*.md` are loaded ONCE, at SESSION
#   START — exactly like hooks. A definition installed or updated MID-SESSION
#   therefore NEVER reaches a newly spawned agent's BOOTED system prompt: the
#   harness boots that agent on the definition it read at session start, while
#   the file on disk (and everyone's mental model) says otherwise. In the
#   upstream production project this engine was extracted from, that cost 25
#   rejected deliverables on 2026-08-06: a teammate's definition was upgraded
#   (v2.0 -> v2.1) and the work was dispatched in the SAME session, so three of
#   four batches silently drafted under the stale v2.0 contract and every one
#   had to be thrown away. That project's incident write-up does not ship with
#   this engine — the lesson does, and this pair is the lesson made structural.
#   Doctrine (the "How to Delegate" section of your CLAUDE.md) is advisory and
#   degrades silently. This hook pair makes the drift STRUCTURALLY visible at
#   the spawn boundary instead.
#
# WHAT THIS HOOK WRITES
#   .claude/state/agent-definitions-<session8>.snapshot   (session-scoped)
#   .claude/state/agent-definitions-latest.snapshot       (symlink -> newest)
#
#   Format — one record per definition file, `shasum -a 256`-shaped, plus two
#   leading `#` comment lines that any consumer skips:
#     # agent-definition snapshot — written by scripts/hooks/snapshot-agent-definitions.sh
#     # session=<id|unknown> generated=<iso8601Z> root=<abs> count=<n>
#     <sha256>  .claude/agents/ace.md
#     <sha256>  .claude/agents/andy.md
#     ...
#   Paths are REPO-RELATIVE so a snapshot is comparable across checkouts.
#
# WHERE IT READS FROM: the TRUE main checkout, resolved via
# scripts/lib/resolve-main-checkout.sh (the same helper the sibling hooks
# use), so a copy of this script running from a linked worktree
# still snapshots — and the partner guard still compares against — the ONE
# shared `.claude/agents/` the harness actually boots teammates from.
#
# SESSION ID RESOLUTION (first hit wins):
#   1. --session <id>            (explicit, used by tests)
#   2. $CLAUDE_SESSION_ID        (if the harness exports it)
#   3. session_id in the SessionStart JSON payload on stdin
#   4. none -> a timestamped filename; the `latest` symlink is the only handle
#   Only the first 8 characters are used, matching the session-<first8>
#   convention the team dir and the sibling guards already use.
#
# LOG-ONLY / NEVER BLOCKS: like every other SessionStart hook. Every
# failure mode (no `.claude/agents/` dir, unwritable state dir, missing
# python3, absent stdin) is swallowed — this hook ALWAYS exits 0 and NEVER
# holds up a session start. A missing snapshot is handled by the partner
# guard as "cannot prove drift -> allow + warn", never as a block.
#
# RETENTION: the newest SNAPSHOT_RETAIN (20) snapshot files are kept; older
# ones are pruned so .claude/state/ doesn't grow one file per session forever.
# The `latest` symlink target is never pruned.
#
# TEST OVERRIDE: DEFINITION_DRIFT_ROOT forces the root directory (test-only;
# never set in a real session). The partner guard honours the same variable.
#
# NOTE: hooks are snapshotted per session, so this hook takes effect from the
# NEXT session. It assumes nothing about being live in the session that adds it.

# seconds and counting, inside the contract-integrity probe, before this was
# reverted.
#

# candidate here: CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is measured present and correct in a
# plugin-loaded hook's environment at SessionStart (probe, 2026-08-28), and it
# outranks the payload cwd anyway. Paying a hang risk for a candidate that
# never wins is a bad trade.
