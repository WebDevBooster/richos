# handoff-facts-annotate.sh — PostToolUse. THE RESTART NOTE CARRIES MEASUREMENTS BECAUSE THE
#                             MACHINE PUT THEM THERE, not because anybody remembered to.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY THIS IS A HOOK AND NOT AN INSTRUCTION
# ===========================================================================
# Type U (richos-hq docs/verification/lifecycle-failure-record-2026-09-13.md 10e): the note a
# session writes to save the next one time is produced at the moment of least capacity to
# verify and highest confidence that verification is unnecessary. `CLAUDE.md` already carries
# the rule that would have prevented it — a number carries the command that produced it or it
# carries the word `unverified` — and the rule was never pointed at the handoff, by nobody's
# exemption. A second written copy of a rule its own author breaks changes nothing.
#
# So the measurement is taken by whatever writes the note, at the moment of writing, with no
# step for anybody to skip. The session that wrote the defective note ran NONE of the commands
# that would have settled its three headline figures; every one of them was one command away.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT IT DOES, AND THE TWO LINES IT WILL NOT CROSS
# ===========================================================================
#   1. IT NEVER EDITS A WORD THE AUTHOR WROTE. It appends one delimited section, and refreshes
#      that same section on a later write. Everything outside the delimiters is byte-identical.
#   2. IT NEVER BLOCKS AND NEVER FAILS A TOOL CALL. Exit 0 on every path. It fires after the
#      write has already happened; a fact it could not measure must not look like a failed
#      write of the note.
#
# IT WRITES INTO THE OPERATOR'S OWN MEMORY DIRECTORY, and that is said plainly rather than
# buried: `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/` belongs to the operator, this appends to a
# file there, the addition is delimited and removable, and deleting the block is a complete
# opt-out for that note.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT COUNTS AS A RESTART NOTE — measured, not assumed
# ===========================================================================
# All fifteen session-handoff notes in the operator's memory directory on 2026-09-14 match
# `project_*restart*.md`, and no other file there does. The match is therefore on that shape,
# under a `memory/` directory, and nowhere else.
#
# THE FAST PATH IS ONE GREP. This is registered against every write-shaped tool, so the
# overwhelmingly common answer — "this call has nothing to do with a restart note" — is
# reached before python3 is started at all.
#
# NOTE: hooks are snapshotted at session start, so this is inert until the next session.
