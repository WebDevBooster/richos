# snapshot-enforcing-hooks.sh — SessionStart hook. Records WHICH HOOKS THIS
# SESSION ACTUALLY BOOTED WITH, so the partner Stop hook
# (notice-hook-staleness.sh) can tell the operator, mid-session, that a guard
# landed since then is sitting on disk enforcing nothing.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE FAILURE THIS PAIR EXISTS TO CLOSE (2026-08-30, this operation)
# ===========================================================================
# Six guards were landed in one day. The lander knew they were inert until the
# session restarted, and said so — in the form "they arm at next session start".
# That sentence describes a DATE. It does not describe an ACTION, and it does
# not name an ACTOR. The operator read it as a thing that would happen to him
# rather than a thing he could do, in five seconds, at any moment. Nobody told
# him that restarting was available RIGHT NOW. He then hit a failure that three
# of those six guards would have caught.
#
# Nothing was wrong with the guards. Nothing was even factually wrong with the
# sentence. What was missing was that a deferred activation had been reported as
# a forecast instead of a request, so no one acted on it.
#
#   A DEFERRED ACTIVATION MUST NAME THE ACTOR AND THE ACTION.
#   Never "this arms at the next session" — always "restart the session to arm
#   this; that is the operator's to do." A state change that requires a human
#   action is not a date, it is a request.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT IS AND IS NOT FROZEN AT SESSION START — MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED
# ===========================================================================
# The comparison this pair makes is only honest if it compares the ONE surface
# that is genuinely frozen. Both surfaces were probed against the shipping
# binary (2.1.251) on 2026-08-30, each with a negative control that had to fire
# before the result counted:
#
#   PLUGIN hooks/hooks.json ............ FROZEN AT SESSION START.
#     A plugin was installed from a directory marketplace and loaded; a Bash
#     PostToolUse hook from it fired (negative control, three times). Its
#     hooks.json was then rewritten mid-session to add a second hook. The new
#     hook NEVER fired. The binary agrees: plugin hooks re-register only when
#     PLUGIN-AFFECTING SETTINGS change (enabledPlugins, pluginConfigs, trust,
#     marketplaces, the disable switches) — a subscription on `policySettings`
#     that compares a snapshot of exactly those keys. The plugin's OWN hook
#     table is not in that snapshot, so editing it triggers nothing. The
#     binary's operator-facing string for this case says: "edits there take
#     effect after /reload-plugins".
#
#   .claude/settings.local.json ........ HOT-RELOADS MID-SESSION.
#     Same three-call shape, same session: a second hook appended to a project
#     settings file DID fire on the very next tool call. The binary's own
#     hook-authoring guidance explains the boundary — the settings watcher
#     "only watches directories that had a settings file when this session
#     started", and an adopted repo's .claude/ always did.
#
# THIS IS WHY ONLY THE PLUGIN SURFACE IS SNAPSHOTTED. Including the settings
# surface would have produced a confident, well-formatted false positive on
# every settings edit — reporting as inert a hook that was already enforcing.
# The engine registers the same guards on both surfaces, so the temptation to
# "check both for completeness" was real and would have been wrong.
#
# HOOK SCRIPT BODIES ARE DELIBERATELY NOT SNAPSHOTTED either, for the same
# reason and with the same evidence: a registration names `bash <path>`, and
# that path is executed afresh on every event. Edit a registered guard's body
# mid-session and the next fire runs the new body. Reporting a body edit as
# "inert" would be a false positive. Only the REGISTRATION is frozen, so only
# the registration is compared.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THIS HOOK WRITES
# ===========================================================================
#   .claude/state/enforcing-hooks-<session8>.snapshot   (session-scoped)
#   .claude/state/enforcing-hooks-latest.snapshot       (symlink -> newest)
#
#   Two `#` header lines any consumer skips, then one TAB-separated row per
#   registered hook script, sorted:
#     # enforcing-hook snapshot — written by scripts/hooks/snapshot-enforcing-hooks.sh
#     # session=<id|unknown> generated=<iso8601Z> engine=<abs> surface=hooks/hooks.json rows=<n>
#     PreToolUse<TAB>Agent<TAB>guard-worktree-isolation.sh
#     SessionStart<TAB>-<TAB>engine-status.sh
#     ...
#
#   `rows=<n>` in the header is the partner's NEGATIVE CONTROL anchor. The
#   comparer re-counts the rows it parsed and refuses to report "no drift"
#   unless the count agrees and is non-zero — so a green run can never mean
#   "clean because nothing was read". This engine has already shipped one
#   scanner that reported CLEAN over an empty corpus; the count is there so
#   there is not a second.
#
#   NEITHER SIDE IS EVER TYPED. Both the baseline written here and the current
#   set read by the partner come from registered_hook_rows() over the same
#   hooks/hooks.json. A typed list of 14 where the registration held 15 is the
#   drift that started this whole sequence, and it is not repeated here.
#
# WHERE IT READS FROM: the ENGINE root (the plugin root under a plugin load),
# because hooks/hooks.json is the engine's own registration surface. WHERE IT
# WRITES: the ENTITY root, the governed repository, alongside every other
# guard's state.
#
# SESSION ID RESOLUTION (first hit wins) — identical to
# snapshot-agent-definitions.sh, deliberately:
#   1. --session <id>        (explicit, used by tests)
#   2. $CLAUDE_SESSION_ID
#   3. session_id in the SessionStart JSON payload on stdin
#   4. none -> a timestamped filename; the `latest` symlink is the only handle
#
# LOG-ONLY / NEVER BLOCKS: always exits 0. Every failure mode (unresolvable
# root, unwritable state dir, missing python3, absent stdin) is survivable —
# but none of them is SILENT: each one is announced through the SessionStart
# context so "no baseline was written" can never look like "nothing drifted".
#
# RETENTION: the newest SNAPSHOT_RETAIN (20) snapshots are kept.
#
# TEST OVERRIDE: HOOK_STALENESS_ROOT forces the governed root and
# HOOK_STALENESS_SURFACE forces the hooks.json path (test-only; never set in a
# real session). The partner hook honours both.
#
# WHEN THIS PAIR ITSELF ARMS — the same rule it exists to enforce, applied to
# itself and stated as a request rather than a date: this hook is registered in
# hooks/hooks.json, which the host reads once at session start. In the session
# that MERGES it, it is inert and writes no baseline; the partner will say so
# rather than pretend. TO ARM IT: re-run scripts/hooks/install.sh, then RESTART
# THE SESSION. That is the operator's to do — no hook, and no model, can do it.

# NOTE ON STDIN — read LATE, CONDITIONALLY, and with a CEILING.
#
# This file is a SessionStart hook AND a plain CLI tool. Root resolution needs
# nothing from stdin, so it happens first, and the payload is read further down
# only when no --session was supplied.
#
# That condition was once believed to make an unbounded `cat` unreachable. It
# does not, and this is the correction of 2026-09-05: the no---session case is
# EXACTLY the real SessionStart firing, and any script invoking this hook with
# an inherited, never-closed stdin reaches it too. Measured on unmodified main:
# with an open, never-closed stdin this hook never returned, while the same run
# with stdin closed finished in under a second. `[ ! -t 0 ]` never helped — an
# inherited pipe is not a TTY, which is the whole reason the guard reads as if
# it were sufficient.
#
# So the read is BOUNDED (`read -t`, below) rather than merely conditional. A
# hook that needs no payload must not be stoppable by one, and a hook that does
# need it must not be able to wait forever for it.
#
# WHY THE CEILING MATTERS MORE HERE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE: a SessionStart hook
# that blocks holds the WHOLE session for as long as it blocks. Measured
# against the shipped binary (claude 2.1.261, 2026-09-05): a SessionStart hook
# blocking on an unclosed stdin held a headless session for 602 seconds, to the
# exact moment the writer let go. There is no rescue timeout on that path. The
# failure is also silent — with stdin already closed it exits 0 instantly,
# which is why this class survives unnoticed in a test suite.
