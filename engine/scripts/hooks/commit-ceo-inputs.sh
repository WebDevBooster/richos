# commit-ceo-inputs.sh — NON-BLOCKING UserPromptSubmit hook. THE INGRESS.
#                        A FILE HE HANDS OVER ENTERS THE RECORD BY ITSELF.
#
# The predicate, the gates, the git plumbing, the refusals and the reasoning
# behind every one of them are in commit-ceo-inputs.py. Read that first — it is
# the analysis half. This file is the wiring, the channel and the one sentence.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE RULE
# ===========================================================================
# A path this message names, that exists on disk, that sits inside a git
# repository, and that git is NOT holding, is COMMITTED — unmodified, now, with
# a message saying it is his input and where it came from.
#
# Unless a safety gate refuses. Then nothing is committed and the refusal is
# stated with its reason and where the file should live instead.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY IT COMMITS INSTEAD OF REMINDING
# ===========================================================================
# The first version of this hook only noticed. The CEO rejected it in one line:
#
#     "'it does not commit for you': Then who commits for me? Santa Claus?"
#
# His complaint was that a document went uncommitted because the orchestrator
# forgot. A mechanism whose last link is the orchestrator remembering is the
# same failure with a reminder bolted on. So the judgment is made MECHANICAL
# rather than reserved for a human step, out of gates this engine already ships
# — scan-secrets.sh and guard-publication-writes.sh — invoked, never rewritten.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY IT NEVER BLOCKS — MEASURED
# ===========================================================================
# Claude Code 2.1.261, from the shipped binary's own hook-event table:
#
#     UserPromptSubmit
#       Exit code 0      - stdout shown to Claude
#       Exit code 2      - block processing, ERASE ORIGINAL PROMPT, show stderr
#       Other exit codes - show stderr to user only
#
# A blocking ingress hook does not hold his message pending a fix. IT DELETES
# WHAT HE TYPED. So the only exit code in this file is 0, on every path
# including catastrophe, and the same binary's `suppressOriginalPrompt` — the
# same destruction wearing a JSON key — is never emitted.
#
# Default timeout for this event is 30000 ms and the registration sets its own.
# A local git commit is milliseconds; the budget is not close. Hooks are
# ordinary spawned processes with no restriction on side effects, and this
# engine already performs git side effects from hooks — terminalize-agent-
# worktrees.sh runs `git update-ref` from SubagentStop. Nothing here is a new
# capability; it is an established one pointed at the ingress.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE CHANNEL — BOTH AUDIENCES, ONE JSON OBJECT
# ===========================================================================
# hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext reaches the ORCHESTRATOR (measured cap:
# 8000 characters, 200 lines; a hookEventName that does not match the event
# causes the host to DROP the whole object, which is why it is spelled out
# literally below). systemMessage reaches the OPERATOR (cap 4000 characters, 20
# lines) and is kept to one line.
#
# ONE object, because the host parses stdout as a single JSON document — two
# would be a parse failure, and a parse failure here degrades to the raw text
# being injected, which is ugly but still carries the fact. Degrading toward
# noise is recoverable by someone who can read it; degrading toward silence
# rebuilds the defect.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE ABSENCE OF A FINDING IS NOT THE ABSENCE OF A CHECK
# ===========================================================================
# Every run appends one line to <entity>/.claude/state/ceo-inputs.jsonl — a run
# that committed nothing writes a line saying so. That ledger is the positive
# trace, and it is what notice-ceo-inputs-unheld.sh re-reads at every turn end,
# so a REFUSAL cannot be announced once and then forgotten. A hook fires on one
# message and cannot tell whether anyone acted; the Stop-side partner is how
# that loop closes.
#
# Every way this hook can fail to do its job — stood down, no python3, no
# analyzer, unresolvable root, unreadable payload — is ANNOUNCED. Silence from
# this hook means "it ran and there was nothing to hold", and nothing else.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHEN IT TAKES EFFECT
# ===========================================================================
# Hooks snapshot at session start. Installing this changes NOTHING in the
# session that installs it; it begins working in the NEXT session. Verify it
# with a direct invocation and a constructed payload:
#
#     scripts/hooks/commit-ceo-inputs.sh --self-test
#
# Exit codes: always 0. This hook never refuses a message.
