turn-manifest.py — the rendering half of the Stop-time TURN MANIFEST.

Called by turn-manifest.sh, which has already resolved the two roots and
decided that this repository adopted the engine. This file reads the turn's
tool traffic and renders it. It never decides whether to run, and it never
decides anything about the turn.

===========================================================================
WHAT THIS IS FOR
===========================================================================
The orchestrator's recurring failure is not lying. It is reporting THE
STRONGEST READING OF A NARROW RESULT — a fact that is true, standing in for
the broader claim it resembles. Five instances from the record:

    what the tool actually returned        what was reported
    -------------------------------------  --------------------------------
    "Message queued for delivery at its    "I've told him"
     next tool round"
    (no tool call at all)                  "dispatching it rather than
                                            queuing it"
    a typed list of 13 passed              "13/13 guards"
    one glob matched 18 files              "18/18 suites"
    no file EXTENSIONS matched             "no media committed"

The CEO caught all five. That makes him the detection mechanism for the
orchestrator's own claims, which is the last unmechanized failure class he has
actually been hit by.

===========================================================================
THIS IS DELIBERATELY NOT A DETECTOR — AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN
===========================================================================
There is nothing here that reads the orchestrator's prose, nothing that scores
it, nothing that decides whether a sentence overstates. So there is no
threshold to tune and the false-positive rate is ZERO BY CONSTRUCTION.

It does not CATCH an overstatement. It makes one UNSUSTAINABLE, by printing
the true status directly beneath the claim, in the same scroll, where the
reader is already looking. "I've told him" survives only until the next line
says `SendMessage  Message queued for delivery to norm-opus-c1 at its next
tool round.`

That is the same move as Timeline refusing to implement Serialize in
richos-core, and the closed-vocabulary feedback payload: UNREPRESENTABLE
rather than DETECTABLE. Judging the prose is a different job and it already
has an owner — guard-unresolved-claims.sh, which measured its own precision
before it was allowed to block anything.

===========================================================================
IT NEVER BLOCKS, AND THAT IS NOT A LIMITATION
===========================================================================
A manifest that can refuse a turn is a different, worse mechanism: it would
need an opinion about which turns deserve refusing, which is the prose
judgment this file exists to avoid. This one only renders. Every exit is 0.

===========================================================================
WHERE THE TEXT GOES — VERIFIED LIVE, NOT ASSUMED
===========================================================================
A Stop hook reaches the OPERATOR (not just the model) by writing
`{"systemMessage": "..."}` to stdout and exiting 0. Verified against the
shipping binary 2.1.251 in two ways:

  * STATIC. The command-hook runner parses the hook's stdout as JSON and
    carries `systemMessage` out of it (`Pt = Ke && ip(Ke) ? Ke.systemMessage
    : void 0`), independently of exit status; the consumer then yields a
    message of type `hook_system_message` tagged with the hook's event. The
    binary's own bundled documentation names the pattern explicitly under the
    heading "Stop hook that displays message to user".

  * LIVE. A sandbox project with one Stop hook emitting
    {"suppressOutput":true,"systemMessage":"..."} was run headless. The
    stream carried, after the assistant's final text and before the result:
      {"type":"system","subtype":"informational",
       "content":"Stop says: <the message>","level":"notice"}
    A multi-line message survives intact; the host prefixes EVERY line with
    "Stop says: ", which is why the rows below are kept narrow.

engine-status.sh already reaches the operator this same way for its session
banner, so this is the engine's existing idiom rather than a new one.

`suppressOutput: true` accompanies it so the raw JSON does not ALSO land in
the transcript as hook stdout — the manifest should appear once.

===========================================================================
SCOPING TO THE TURN — THE BUG THIS FILE MUST NOT REPEAT
===========================================================================
The sibling Stop guard shipped with tool names collected SESSION-WIDE, so its
"did THIS turn call Agent?" question was permanently answered yes after the
first spawn of the session, and its suite passed for weeks because the
fixtures carried no promptId at all. A manifest with that bug is not
degraded, it is INVERTED: it would print the session's calls under the
heading "this turn".

The turn is scoped by promptId, using the binary's own semantic: a UUID
correlating a user prompt with all subsequent events until the next prompt.
Assistant records carry NO promptId (verified against a real 4,718-record
transcript: `tool_use` blocks live in assistant records with promptId null,
`tool_result` blocks live in user records that DO carry it). So the turn is
the file-order span from the first record bearing this prompt_id to the end
of the file — at Stop time there is no next prompt yet.

AND WHERE THE SIBLING FAILS OPEN WIDE, THIS ONE REFUSES. Absent a prompt_id
the sibling counts the whole session, because for its one consumer the wide
answer is the QUIET one. For a manifest the wide answer is a FALSE one: it
would attribute the session's calls to this turn. So an unscopable turn
renders an explicit UNAVAILABLE notice and lists nothing. Same instinct in
both files — say nothing rather than say wrong — expressed opposite ways
because the consumers differ.

===========================================================================
WHERE THE STATUSES COME FROM — STRUCTURE, NEVER PROSE
===========================================================================
Each row's status is derived from the RESULT RECORD'S SHAPE, in this order:

  no matching tool_result in the turn  -> NO RESULT
  the result carries is_error: true    -> ERROR + the result's own first line
  the result is a JSON object with a
    top-level string field "message"   -> that string, VERBATIM
  anything else                        -> ok + a measured size

The third rule is the one that closes the motivating failure. When a tool
declares its own outcome in a `message` field, THAT SENTENCE IS THE STATUS
and it is reproduced word for word. SendMessage returns
{"success":true,"message":"Message queued for delivery to ... at its next
tool round."} — a manifest that rendered `success: true` would be committing
the very error it exists to prevent, so it renders the sentence and not the
flag.

None of these rules interprets anything. is_error is a field. "message" is a
field. The rest is arithmetic on bytes.

===========================================================================
TRUNCATION IS ANNOUNCED, ALWAYS
===========================================================================
A manifest that silently elides is the defect it exists to prevent, rebuilt.
So:
  * the header tallies EVERY call by tool name, before any row is dropped —
    a SendMessage can never be truncated into invisibility;
  * dropping rows prints how many were dropped and their tally by name;
  * a shortened detail says how many characters were removed.

Exit code: always 0. This hook cannot fail a turn.
