# notice-hook-staleness.sh — NON-BLOCKING Stop hook. Tells the OPERATOR, during
# the session, that a guard has been landed into the engine's hook table since
# this session booted, that it is therefore doing nothing right now, and that
# restarting the session is what arms it.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE FAILURE (2026-08-30, this operation)
# ===========================================================================
# Six guards were landed in one day. The lander knew they were inert until the
# session restarted and said so — in the form "they arm at next session start".
# That sentence names a DATE. It names no ACTOR and no ACTION. The operator
# read it as something that would happen TO him rather than something he could
# do, in five seconds, whenever he liked; nobody ever told him restarting was
# an available move. He then hit a failure three of those six guards would have
# caught.
#
# The guards were fine. The sentence was not even false. What was missing is
# that a deferred activation had been reported as a forecast instead of a
# request, so nobody acted on it. Hence the rule this hook exists to make
# unforgettable, stated so it generalises past hooks:
#
#   A DEFERRED ACTIVATION MUST NAME THE ACTOR AND THE ACTION.
#   Never "this arms at the next session" — always "restart the session to arm
#   this; that is the operator's to do." A state change that requires a human
#   action is not a date, it is a request.
#
# So this notice states three things EVERY time it fires, and a change that
# drops any of them has broken it:
#   1. WHICH guards are landed but not enforcing — named, derived, never typed;
#   2. that they are inert RIGHT NOW, for the rest of this session;
#   3. that RESTARTING THE SESSION arms them, and that this is the operator's
#      to do. A notice that reports drift without naming the remedy would
#      rebuild the original failure in a new place.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY Stop, AND WHY systemMessage — ESTABLISHED AGAINST THE BINARY, NOT ASSUMED
# ===========================================================================
# The notice has to reach the operator DURING the session. The next session
# start is exactly when the problem has already solved itself, so announcing it
# there would be a status line about a thing that is no longer true.
#
# Measured against the shipping binary (2.1.251) on 2026-08-30:
#   * A Stop hook that exits 0 and prints {"systemMessage": "..."} on stdout
#     surfaces to the OPERATOR. Run live: the stream carried
#     {"type":"system","subtype":"informational","content":"Stop says: <msg>",
#     "level":"notice"}. The binary's own hook documentation gives this exact
#     recipe under the heading "Stop hook that displays message to user", and
#     lists systemMessage as "Display a message to the user (all hooks)".
#   * The other channels do NOT reach the human. hookSpecificOutput.
#     additionalContext is documented as "Text injected into model context";
#     stderr from a non-blocking hook reaches the debug log. Both were the
#     failure mode engine-status.sh was rebuilt to escape on 2026-08-28, when an
#     operator looked for a banner that had gone somewhere only the model could
#     see and concluded the engine was not loaded.
#
# THE AUDIENCE IS THE OPERATOR ON PURPOSE, not by omission. The remedy is a
# session restart, and the binary's own hook-authoring guidance is explicit that
# the assistant cannot do it: "Tell the user to open /hooks once (reloads
# config) or restart — you can't do this yourself". Addressing this notice to
# the model would be telling the one party that cannot act.
#
# ONE Stop hook already exists (guard-unresolved-claims.sh) and this is
# deliberately NOT folded into it. That one is a blocking gate on report
# integrity that fails open; this one is a non-blocking status notice. Sharing a
# process would mean one of them inheriting the other's exit-code contract.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT IS COMPARED, AND WHY EXACTLY THIS — MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED
# ===========================================================================
# Only the PLUGIN registration surface, hooks/hooks.json. The full experimental
# record is in the partner hook's header; the result:
#
#   hooks/hooks.json ............ FROZEN at session start. A hook added to a
#                                 loaded plugin's table mid-session never fired
#                                 (negative control: a hook already in that
#                                 table fired three times in the same run).
#   .claude/settings.local.json . HOT-RELOADS. A hook appended to a project
#                                 settings file fired on the very next tool
#                                 call, same session.
#   hook script BODIES .......... NOT frozen. A registration names `bash
#                                 <path>`, executed afresh per event.
#
# Comparing the settings surface, or script hashes, would produce a confident
# false positive on every settings edit and every guard body edit — reporting as
# INERT something that was already enforcing. The engine registers the same
# guards on both surfaces, so "check both for completeness" was a real
# temptation and would have been exactly wrong.
#
# ===========================================================================
# ZERO FALSE POSITIVES — WHY THAT IS ACHIEVABLE HERE AND NOT MERELY HOPED FOR
# ===========================================================================
# The comparison is a recorded set of facts against a re-derived set of the same
# facts, from the same file, through the same parser (registered_hook_rows).
# There is no threshold, no heuristic, no prose, and nothing to tune. If a
# design for this needed a threshold it had taken a wrong branch. A session in
# which hooks/hooks.json did not change produces the empty delta and this hook
# prints NOTHING AT ALL — asserted by the suite, because "quiet when nothing
# happened" is the property that keeps a notice worth reading.
#
# NEGATIVE CONTROL. A comparison that read nothing would produce an empty delta
# too, and would look identical to a clean run. So a green run must additionally
# prove it examined something:
#   * the baseline's `rows=<n>` header must agree with the number of rows
#     actually parsed out of it, and be >= 1;
#   * the current derivation must yield >= 1 row;
#   * the baseline's `engine=` must match the engine this hook resolved, or the
#     two sides are not descriptions of the same thing.
# Any of those failing means the comparison CANNOT BE MADE HONESTLY, and this
# hook says so instead of passing quietly. This operation has already shipped
# one scanner that reported CLEAN over an empty corpus and one reporting layer
# that was dead for weeks; this is the check that stops a third.
#
# ===========================================================================
# CADENCE — ONCE, THEN AGAIN ONLY IF IT GROWS
# ===========================================================================
# A notice on every turn is noise, noise gets muted, and a muted notice is worse
# than none. So the announced delta is recorded in
# .claude/state/hook-staleness-<session8>.announced, and this hook speaks only
# when the current delta is NOT a subset of what has already been announced —
# i.e. the first time drift appears, and again each time it GROWS. A delta that
# shrinks (someone reverted) says nothing new and stays quiet.
#
# NEVER BLOCKS. This is information, not enforcement. A stale hook set is not a
# reason to refuse work; it is a reason to tell the operator to restart. Every
# path exits 0.
#
# TEST OVERRIDES: HOOK_STALENESS_ROOT forces the governed root and
# HOOK_STALENESS_SURFACE forces the hooks.json path (test-only; never set in a
# real session). The partner snapshotter honours both.
#
# Exit codes: 0, always.
#
# WHEN THIS HOOK ITSELF ARMS — the rule above, applied to itself, as a request
# rather than a date: it is registered in hooks/hooks.json, which the host reads
# once at session start, so in the session that MERGES it, it is inert and will
# not fire. TO ARM IT: re-run scripts/hooks/install.sh, then RESTART THE
# SESSION. That is the operator's to do; no hook and no model can do it.
