# ceo-ruled.mutation.sh — PROVES THE CEO-RULED SUITE CAN FAIL, AND PROVES ITS
#                         LIVE-RECORD SECTION CANNOT BE REDDENED BY THE RECORD.
#
# Two halves, and the second one is the reason this file exists at all.
#
# HALF ONE — THE ORDINARY ONE. Forty-one green ticks are evidence of nothing
# until somebody shows them turning red for the right reason. So: take the
# SHIPPED source, remove ONE property at a time, and assert that
#   1. ceo-ruled.test.sh FAILS,
#   2. the SPECIFIC named case fails — not merely "something went red", and
#   3. the mutation actually applied (a replacement matching nothing gives a
#      green run that looks like a green run, which is the same trap again).
#
# HALF TWO — THE DRIFT DEMONSTRATION. Section 8 of that suite is the only part
# that touches the real register, and on 2026-09-04 it was RED — not because
# the gate broke, but because case 8a asserted that the refusal cited "row
# 3.14" and open-items.md had retired that row two days earlier in ordinary
# maintenance. The case was rewritten to assert what the gate does rather than
# what the record currently says. THAT REWRITE IS A CLAIM, and a claim about
# not-being-fragile is exactly the kind that decays quietly. So this harness
# renumbers every section of the register, renumbers every row, and shifts
# every line number, then requires the suite to stay GREEN while proving the
# citations it printed genuinely changed underneath it.
#
# Every mutant is a throwaway copy of the engine subtree. Nothing here touches
# the real tree, and nothing here writes to the live record — the drifted
# register is a copy in a temporary directory.
#
# Run directly: scripts/hooks/ceo-ruled.mutation.sh
# Exit 0 = every property is proven load-bearing AND the drift claim holds.
