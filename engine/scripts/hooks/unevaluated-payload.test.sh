# unevaluated-payload.test.sh — NO REGISTERED GUARD MAY PASS A CALL IT NEVER
#                                READ WITHOUT SAYING SO.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE PROPERTY
# ===========================================================================
#
#     THE ABSENCE OF A FINDING MUST BE DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE ABSENCE OF A
#     CHECK.
#
# On 2026-09-05 all forty registered PreToolUse and Stop hooks were driven with
# an EMPTY payload, a TRUNCATED one and one that is not JSON
# (docs/verification/hook-payload-failure-modes-2026-09-05.md). Thirty exited 0
# with nothing on either stream, and in sixteen of those a finding observed on a
# valid payload vanished entirely. A guard that never looked at a call was
# byte-for-byte indistinguishable from a guard that looked and approved.
#
# This suite is what stops that coming back, and what covers a hook registered
# tomorrow with no edit here.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE SET IS DERIVED, NEVER TYPED
# ===========================================================================
# Both inventories come from hooks/hooks.json through the one shared parser
# (scripts/lib/registered-hooks.sh), for the reason that file documents: a TYPED
# list of 14 where the registration held 15 is the defect that opened this whole
# sequence, and the survey itself found the PreToolUse count had moved from 23 to
# 25 under it the same day. A hook added tomorrow is judged here automatically.
#
# NEGATIVE CONTROL: the derivation is asserted non-empty and the number printed.
#
# ===========================================================================
# HOW EACH HOOK IS JUDGED — BY DRIVING IT, WITH ONE EXCEPTION
# ===========================================================================
# Every hook is run four times: a well-formed CONTROL payload for its matcher,
# then the three degraded shapes. What it does decides its class:
#
#   REFUSES the degraded payloads          -> fail-closed. Proven, and it needs
#                                             no word in its source.
#   ANNOUNCES on the degraded payloads     -> audible. Proven, likewise.
#   IDENTICAL output on all four           -> payload-independent, BUT ONLY IF
#                                             THE SOURCE SAYS SO (below).
#   anything else                          -> FAIL, by name.
#
# THE ONE EXCEPTION, AND WHY IT IS THE ONLY ONE. A hook that is silent on all
# four looks exactly the same whether its predicate never needed the payload or
# its predicate was silently lost. That is the defect itself, and it is the one
# thing driving a hook cannot tell you apart. So payload-independence must be
# CLAIMED by a person, in the hook, where a reviewer sees it —
#
#     # UNEVALUATED-PAYLOAD-EXEMPT: payload-independent — <reason>
#
# — and this suite then holds the claim to its consequence: the output really
# must be identical across all four payloads. A bare marker exempts nothing, the
# same discipline the dialect and contrast exemptions carry.
#
# THE CONTROL ARM IS NOT DECORATION. Without it, a hook that announced on EVERY
# call would pass. Silence on a payload the guard could read is a requirement in
# its own right: a message on every clean call is noise, and noise is how a real
# signal gets ignored.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THIS SUITE DOES NOT ASSERT
# ===========================================================================
# Nothing here requires any guard to fail CLOSED. Which gates are worth the risk
# of bricking a live session is a judgment that differs per gate and it has not
# been taken. This suite only requires that an unevaluated call is not silent.
#
# Usage: scripts/hooks/unevaluated-payload.test.sh
# Exit:  0 all checks passed, 1 otherwise.

# guard-ceo-ruled-ask.sh landed in the silent-and-undeclared bucket on a bare
# sandbox, which would have been a red for a defect that does not exist. Both
# stand down when the repository DECLARES no CEO list and no rulings record, and
