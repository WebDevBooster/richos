# notice-inflight-sends.sh — PostToolUse[SendMessage] hook. LOG-ONLY; never blocks.
#
# THE WITNESS THAT MAKES THE SEND HALF ENFORCEABLE.
#
# rich-lander/SKILL.md §8b says: when a land moves main under a live teammate,
# MESSAGE THEM. Twice on 2026-08-30 that was not done, and the only record of
# the omission was the damage — an eight-hunk conflict across five files, and a
# library that shipped at 7 of 19. A written step cannot be checked. A send can.
#
# So this hook writes one JSON line per message the LEAD authored:
#
#   -> <team dir>/inflight-notices.jsonl   (fallback: ~/.claude/inflight-notices.jsonl)
#
# guard-inflight-notify.sh reads that ledger and REFUSES a push that leaves a
# live teammate behind with no line in it.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE ATTRIBUTION GATE IS THE EXACT MIRROR OF ITS SIBLING
# ===========================================================================
# worker-updated-handoff.sh logs sends where agent_id is PRESENT — a worker
# reporting. This hook logs sends where agent_id is ABSENT — the lead
# messaging a teammate. Same field, opposite branch, and between them every
# SendMessage that actually resolves is witnessed exactly once by exactly one
# of them. Neither reads a mailbox: both observe the SEND, in the sender's own
# execution, at the moment the tool call resolves. That is what makes the
# record true even when delivery drops, which is the whole point given a
# channel measured at ~50% loss.
#
# WHY PostToolUse. PreToolUse[SendMessage] fires on the INTENT, and the
# blocking guard-resume-isolation.sh sits there and can veto the call. A
# PreToolUse-sourced record would credit the lander for notices that were
# refused and never sent. PostToolUse fires only for a send that went through.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT IS RECORDED, AND WHY THE SHAs ARE THE EXCEPTION
# ===========================================================================
# The sibling hook's rule stands: THE MESSAGE BODY IS NEVER LOGGED. It can
# carry anything, and an evidence log that quietly accumulates model output is
# a privacy defect waiting to happen. Recorded instead: the recipient, the
# tool's own short `summary`, the body's length and sha256 — and the one
# addition this guard needs, every 7-40 character hex run in the body.
#
# A commit SHA is a public identifier, not a credential, and it is the only
# thing that can tie a notice to the land it is about. Without it the ledger
# could say "somebody was messaged" and never "somebody was told about THIS
# move", which is the difference between a log and a guarantee. The extraction
# is a plain hex regex; it cannot pull out prose, and anything it does pull out
# is by construction a bare hex token.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE RECIPIENT IS RECORDED TWICE: AS ADDRESSED, AND AS RESOLVED
# ===========================================================================
# `to` is what SendMessage was handed — always the teammate's MANDATORY UNIQUE
# NAME (`zach-opus-s1`), because that is the only thing it can be addressed
# with. That is recorded verbatim and always.
#
# `to_agent_id` is that name resolved to an agent id, HERE, in the lead's own
# execution, by scripts/lib/teammate-identity.py — the same module the guard
# resolves worktrees with. It is added because of 2026-08-31: two notices were
# genuinely sent, witnessed and logged, and the guard still reported
# OWED-NO-NOTICE, because the debt side was resolving teammates as the ROLE
# (`zach`, from worker-events `agent_type`) and nothing could ever join `zach`
# to `zach-opus-s1`. Recording the resolved id makes the join exact and makes
# it independent of what the debt side can still resolve at push time.
#
# BEST EFFORT, NEVER LOAD-BEARING HERE: an unresolvable name records an empty
# `to_agent_id` and the guard falls back to matching on the name. This hook
# never fails, never blocks, and never delays a send over an identity lookup.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THIS LEDGER DOES NOT PROVE — named, not implied
# ===========================================================================
# It proves the lead SENT a message naming a SHA to a named recipient. It does
# NOT prove the message was delivered, read, or understood; those are the ack's
# job (scripts/lib/inflight.py -> ack_status). And it is not fraud-proof:
# anyone with Bash can append a line to a JSONL file. The failure being
# engineered out is FORGETTING. Fabrication is a different act, and no hook in
# this engine claims to stop it.
#
# NEVER BLOCKS, ALWAYS EXIT 0. Env override for tests: INFLIGHT_TEAMS_DIR
# (WORKER_EVENTS_TEAMS_DIR is honored too, so a test harness that already sets
# one does not have to set two).
