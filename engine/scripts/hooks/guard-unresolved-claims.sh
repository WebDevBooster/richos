# guard-unresolved-claims.sh — BLOCKING Stop hook. The first enforcement point
# in this engine that observes the ORCHESTRATOR'S BEHAVIOR rather than the
# repository's state.
#
# WHY A Stop HOOK, AND WHAT WAS VERIFIED BEFORE BUILDING ON IT
#   Every other guard here is PreToolUse/PostToolUse/SessionStart — they watch
#   the repo. Two recurring failures happen inside the turn itself, where no
#   repository hook can see them:
#     1. ending a turn by NAMING the next step instead of taking it
#     2. writing an action claim -- "dispatching it now" -- with no
#        corresponding tool call
#   Both happen at exactly the boundary a Stop hook fires on.
#
#   Verified against the SHIPPING BINARY (2.1.251), not documentation:
#     * `Stop` is in the binary's own hook-event list, alongside `StopFailure`
#       and `SubagentStop`.
#     * A Stop hook CAN BLOCK. The binary carries the string "A hook blocked the
#       turn from ending", the telemetry counter `tengu_stop_hook_block_count`,
#       and `CLAUDE_CODE_STOP_HOOK_BLOCK_CAP`. Confirmed live: a Stop hook
#       exiting 2 with stderr stopped the turn, the stderr reached the model,
#       and the model acted on it.
#     * The payload carries `transcript_path`, `last_assistant_message`,
#       `stop_hook_active`, `prompt_id`, `background_tasks`, `session_crons`.
#     * The transcript IS readable at Stop time and already holds this turn's
#       tool_use and tool_result records — but NOT the final assistant text,
#       which has not been flushed yet. That is why the message is read from
#       `last_assistant_message` and only the tool traffic from the transcript.
#     * `stop_hook_active` is true on the re-fire after a block, so the gate can
#       stand itself down and never strand a session.
#
# WHAT BLOCKS AND WHAT ONLY REPORTS
#   Blocking: unresolved AGENT NAMES, unresolved COMMIT SHAs, a BARE-ROLE
#     in-flight claim about a role never dispatched in this session, and a
#     POSITIVE STATE CLAIM -- "landed", "merged", "on main", "pushed" -- whose
#     commit is alive on a branch and is not where the sentence says it is.
#     POSITIVE is load-bearing: a sentence that says a commit has NOT landed is
#     making the opposite claim, and on 2026-09-03 and 2026-09-05 this gate
#     blocked exactly that -- a true statement, by the guard whose job is
#     catching false ones. Polarity is now read from the CLAUSE the state word
#     sits in, before git is asked.
#   Reporting: unresolved FILE PATHS, a prose in-flight-dispatch signal, that
#     signal narrowed to messages naming no agent, a bare-role claim about
#     a role that ran EARLIER and is not running now, a VALUE claimed gone
#     that survives in a spelling the claim did not name, and a NEGATED state
#     claim the repository contradicts (understating what landed has never been
#     the failure this gate protects against) or one whose polarity could not
#     be read at all.
#   The full reasoning — monotonic vs shrinking ground truth, the grounding
#   relaxation, and the measured numbers behind each choice — is in the module
#   docstring of guard-unresolved-claims.py, which is the analysis half.
#
#   Measured on 468 real orchestrator turns across six sessions:
#     agent names   5 tokens    0 false positives
#     commit SHAs   262 tokens  0 false positives
#     file paths    572 tokens  15 false positives (2.6%) -> REPORT ONLY
#     prose signal  418 turns   1 true / 5 false (17% precision) -> REPORT ONLY
#
#   Re-measured 2026-08-31 on 4,134 turns / 3,532 final messages, for the
#   bare-role work. THE NUMBERS DECIDED WHICH HALF BLOCKS:
#     bare-role extraction   103 hits, 103 genuine teammate references (103/103)
#     ...never-dispatched      0 fires -> 0 FP, and 0 TP: it guards a case this
#                              corpus does not contain. BLOCKS, costing nothing.
#     ...spawned-but-not-live  the half that catches the 2026-08-31 failure, and
#                              its FP rate CANNOT be measured — past rosters are
#                              not retained. REPORTS until it can be.
#     prose + names-nobody   29 of the 30 prose hits name nobody, so the filter
#                            removes ONE IN THIRTY: 3 true / 29 = 10.3%, against
#                            the 17% it was proposed to replace. REPORT ONLY.
#
#   Re-measured 2026-09-01 on 2,276 turns / 2,206 final messages across all 79
#   non-scratchpad orchestrator transcripts on this machine, for the STATE-CLAIM
#   work. Method and adjudication: scripts/hooks/state-claims.corpus.md.
#     landed/pushed + SHA    573 sentences, 658 citations
#     ...against today      0 fires
#     ...replayed at the    1 fire (0.15% of citations, 0.045% of turns) -- a
#        turn's own clock     claim made 19 minutes before its commit reached
#                             master, counted as a false positive on purpose
#     value-absence, general 95 fires in 109 literals (87%). REPORT ONLY.
#     value-absence, sharp   fires on 22 of 41 value citations once the absence
#                            word stops being the only thing holding it back.
#                            REPORT ONLY, and the reason is in the analyzer.
#
#   Re-measured 2026-09-05 over 960 state claims in 770 messages, for the
#   POLARITY work (docs/verification/claim-polarity-2026-09-05/):
#     positive               949 -- unchanged, still BLOCKS on a contradiction
#     negated                 11 -- report-only; all 11 read by hand and every
#                                   one is a genuine statement of absence
#     unreadable               0
#   The first draft of the rule looked for a negation anywhere in the SENTENCE
#   and demoted 113 positive claims to report-only. It was the count, not the
#   reasoning, that caught it.
#
# FAIL-OPEN, DELIBERATELY, AND ONLY HERE
#   Every other blocking guard in this engine fails CLOSED. This one does not,
#   and the asymmetry is intentional. A PreToolUse guard that fails closed
#   refuses one tool call. A Stop guard that fails closed refuses to let the
#   session END — it re-fires on every retry until the binary's block cap gives
#   up, and the operator watches a wedged session. The thing being protected
#   here is report integrity, not containment of a destructive act. So a broken
#   install, an unparseable payload, a resolver error or an unreadable
#   transcript all pass the turn through.
#
#   FAILING OPEN IS ONLY DEFENSIBLE IF IT IS SEEN, and for a while it was not.
#   All four ways this guard stops enforcing — stood down by config, no
#   python3, no analyzer, no resolvable root — announced themselves on STDERR
#   and exited 0. Measured against 2.1.251: a Stop hook's stderr AND its plain
#   stdout are both filed into the transcript as a `hook_success` attachment
#   and shown to the operator NOWHERE. So this guard could be switched off and
#   the operator's only evidence that it was protecting him was that it was
#   quiet — which is also exactly what being disabled looks like. Its own
#   header called that "a defense that decays into a rumour" and then built
#   one. The notices now go through scripts/lib/stop-hook-notice.sh, on the one
#   channel proven to reach him. engine-status.sh announces BROKEN at session
#   start as well, but it speaks once, at startup, about a different question.
#
# WHEN IT TAKES EFFECT
#   Hooks snapshot at session start. Installing this changes nothing in the
#   session that installs it; it begins enforcing in the NEXT session.
#
# Exit codes (Claude Code Stop convention):
#   0  nothing unresolved, not adopted, not evaluable, or anything went wrong
#   2  BLOCKED — an identifier in the final message resolves against nothing, or
#      a state claim in it contradicts the repository
