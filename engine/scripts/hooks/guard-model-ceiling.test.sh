# guard-model-ceiling.test.sh — regression tests for
# scripts/hooks/guard-model-ceiling.sh.
#
# THE COST CEILING (orchestration.config MODEL_CEILING, ranked only through
# scripts/lib/model-tiers.sh, with the spawn's model resolved only through
# scripts/lib/resolve-model.sh). Covered here:
#
#   (a) a spawn AT or BELOW the ceiling is allowed IN SILENCE — no output on
#       either stream, because a ceiling that comments on the normal case is a
#       nag and a nag is how a guard becomes something to disable;
#   (b) a spawn ABOVE the ceiling is BLOCKED, by explicit `model:` override AND
#       by the agent definition's own model: frontmatter (so the rule is about
#       the RESOLVED model, not about a string in the payload), including a
#       verbose model id that normalizes down to an alias;
#   (c) the refusal CARRIES the rule rather than pointing at it: the ceiling in
#       one line, the three worked examples, the one-off-that-everything-
#       inherits test, the exact ack line, and the reconsider path (drop to the
#       ceiling AND rename the teammate, because the <model> token must stay
#       truthful);
#   (d) the escape hatch `model-ceiling-ack: <reason>` — a reasoned line permits
#       ONE spawn and is logged with both the model and the ceiling; a bare
#       marker, a too-short reason, and a reason that is nothing but an
#       ASSERTION OF MERIT ("most capable", "better", "why not", "important")
#       exempt nothing; a written sentence that merely CONTAINS such a word is
#       allowed through, because judging a real reason's merit is not a
#       machine's job; a refused spawn is never logged;
#   (e) THE DATA IS THE RULE: a ceiling declared at the TOP tier allows the top
#       tier silently, and a ceiling declared LOWER refuses the tier that was
#       fine a moment ago — proving nothing in the guard knows an alias by name;
#   (f) FAIL OPEN, LOUDLY, EVERY TIME: no MODEL_CEILING, an unrankable ceiling,
#       an unrankable resolved model, a blank/malformed MODEL_TIERS, a missing
#       model-tiers.sh, a missing resolve-model.sh, an unresolvable namespaced
#       type and an unparseable payload all ALLOW the spawn and announce that
#       nothing is checking;
#   (g) FAIL OPEN, SILENTLY, for the two states that are not faults: a
#       repository that never adopted the engine, and a spawn whose model is
#       genuinely undeterminable (model:"inherit", or a type with no live
#       definition — the inherit-from-session case);
#   (h) the one hard refusal: a missing scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh prints the
#       shared BROKEN INSTALL banner and exits 2, because a hook that cannot
#       tell which repository it governs must not guess;
#   (i) SCOPE: a read-only agent type over the ceiling is refused like any
#       other — spend is spend, and the isolation exemption is about writing
#       files, not about cost.
#
# Run directly: scripts/hooks/guard-model-ceiling.test.sh
# Exit 0 = all cases pass; exit 1 = at least one failure.
