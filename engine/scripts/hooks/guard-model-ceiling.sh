# guard-model-ceiling.sh — BLOCKING PreToolUse guard on the Agent tool.
#
# REFUSES A SPAWN ON A MODEL TIER ABOVE THE DECLARED COST CEILING, AND CARRIES
# THE WHOLE RULE IN THE REFUSAL.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS TO PREVENT
# ===========================================================================
# The top-tier model is the most capable AND roughly twice the price of the one
# below it, and it burns the subscription quota much faster. Those are two
# different orders, and until 2026-09-03 this engine declared only one of them.
# MODEL_TIERS says which model is STRONGER. It has never said which to SPEND,
# and an orchestrator reading a capability order as a spending order picks the
# top of the list every time something feels important.
#
# The founder's ruling, 2026-09-03: the normal ceiling for CRITICAL work is the
# tier below the top; the top tier is for SUPER-CRITICAL work and extreme
# ONE-OFF cases. The cost of the omission is measured rather than feared — the
# build of one worktree rebuild consumed roughly a third of a week's top-tier
# allowance, and "the founder allowed the top tier for the critical thing"
# quietly became "the top tier is what critical work gets".
#
# HIS OWN DESIGN FOR THIS GUARD, in his words: "Whenever Fable pick is attempted
# it should simply get the orchestrator to reach that note I've just written and
# get him to acknowledge (if he continues with the Fable pick) or reconsider (and
# pick Opus instead)." Both halves — acknowledge, or reconsider — are actionable
# from the refusal text below WITHOUT opening a file, because a refusal that
# says "see the ruling" is a refusal that gets read past.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHO THIS BLOCKS — deliberately, and it is the point
# ===========================================================================
# THE ORCHESTRATOR, not the founder. The founder greenlighting the top tier in
# conversation is a perfectly good reason: the orchestrator writes THAT as the
# reason on the ack line, and the log preserves that he said it. What is refused
# is the reflex — reaching for the strongest alias because the work feels
# important — which is exactly what an unwritten ceiling cannot stop.
#
# EVERY Agent spawn is in scope, including read-only and generic types. Spend is
# spend: a top-tier `Explore` costs the same as a top-tier engineer.
# guard-worktree-isolation.sh exempts those types from ISOLATION because they
# write no files; that has nothing to do with what they cost.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY PreToolUse[Agent], AND NOTHING ELSE
# ===========================================================================
# The model is chosen at exactly one moment — the spawn — and this is the only
# event that sees it before it is paid for. The alternatives, argued rather than
# left to be re-derived:
#
#   SubagentStart — REJECTED. The instance has already booted; a refusal there
#     is a bill with a lecture attached.
#   Stop, as a notice — REJECTED. The founder asked for acknowledge-or-
#     reconsider AT THE PICK. A turn-end notice reports a spend that already
#     happened, which is the thing he is trying not to pay for.
#   A lint over the transcript — REJECTED for the reason every honor-system
#     check in this engine has been retired for: a rule enforced by attention
#     is a rule that holds until the session is busy.
#
# CHAIN POSITION: LAST, appended after guard-ceo-ask-first.sh. The four
# structural guards decide whether the SPAWN is well formed; a dispatch that is
# both malformed and over the ceiling should hear about the malformed half
# first, because that is the half the operator can fix without leaving the
# keyboard. Between this and the CEO-ask gate the order is not load-bearing —
# both are policy — and appending rather than inserting was also the merge-safe
# choice while another engineer held hooks.json open.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE CEILING IS DATA, READ FROM ONE LINE
# ===========================================================================
#     orchestration.config:  MODEL_CEILING="opus"
#
# Parsed ONLY through scripts/lib/model-tiers.sh, the same contract MODEL_TIERS
# has. This guard REFUSES A TIER, never an alias by name: it computes the rank
# of the declared ceiling and the rank of the resolved model and compares the
# two integers. Nothing here contains the word "fable" as a decision. When a
# model above the current top ships, the declaration is re-derived and this file
# needs no edit — which is the whole reason the 2026-09-02 incident's fix was
# data rather than a guard with a name baked into it.
#
# THE MODEL IS RESOLVED BY scripts/lib/resolve-model.sh — the SAME function
# guard-worktree-isolation.sh uses for its truthful-name and capability-tier
# clauses. Not a copy of it. Two resolvers that disagree about which model a
# spawn boots on would produce a refusal naming a model the other guard does not
# see, and this engine has shipped that shape (one question, two answers) often
# enough to know how it ends.
#
# ===========================================================================
# FAIL OPEN, AND LOUDLY — every time
# ===========================================================================
# There is no state in which this guard refuses because it could not decide:
#
#   NOT ADOPTED (no orchestration.config)      -> STAND DOWN, silent. The engine
#     loads at user scope in every directory on the machine; a repository that
#     never adopted it has no ceiling to enforce and a notice in each would be
#     noise.
#   MODEL_CEILING NOT DECLARED                 -> ALLOW, ANNOUNCE. This is the
#     normal state of a fresh adopter, and it is announced on EVERY spawn rather
#     than once, because the alternative is a repository quietly running with no
#     ceiling while a guard sits in the chain looking like protection. The
#     announcement stops the moment the key is declared.
#   CEILING OR MODEL UNRANKABLE / CONFIG OR
#   LIBRARY UNREADABLE / ROOTS UNRESOLVABLE    -> ALLOW, ANNOUNCE. Same
#     argument: "I cannot tell" is never "forbidden", and a guard that wedges
#     every dispatch over its own plumbing is a guard that gets switched off.
#   MODEL UNDETERMINABLE (no override and no
#   definition default, or model:"inherit")    -> ALLOW, SILENT. The instance
#     boots on the SESSION's model; there is no pick to judge, and every spawn
#     of a host built-in is in this state. Announcing here would be a nag on the
#     common path, and a nag is how a guard becomes something to disable.
#
# The one thing that is NOT fail-open: scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh missing
# entirely. That is the shared bootstrap's contract (a hook that cannot tell
# which repository it governs must not guess), it is byte-identical in every
# rooted hook, and probe Layer R asserts that it stays so.
#
# NOTE ON THE LOUD CHANNEL. On a PASSING exit this hook announces on stderr AND
# as a `systemMessage`. The systemMessage channel is PROVEN for Stop hooks and
# only for Stop hooks (scripts/lib/stop-hook-notice.sh carries the measurement);
# whether it reaches the operator from PreToolUse is UNVERIFIED. Both are used
# because a condition announced on nothing is the defect this file is about.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE ESCAPE HATCH — a live prompt line, with a reason, logged
# ===========================================================================
#     model-ceiling-ack: <reason>
#
# anywhere on its own line in the Agent spawn prompt. It permits that ONE spawn
# and appends to <entity root>/.claude/state/model-ceiling-acks.log. Same idiom
# as `model-downgrade-ack:`, `main-checkout-run:`, `resume-ack:` and
# `ceo-todos-deferred:` — and named for the CEILING rather than for a model,
# because the guard refuses a TIER and the name has to stay true when the top
# alias is renamed.
#
# A BARE TOKEN EXEMPTS NOTHING, and neither does a reflex. Beyond the length
# floor this engine's staffing gate already uses, a reason whose entire content
# is an assertion of merit — "most capable", "better", "faster", "why not",
# "quality", "important", "critical" — is refused BY NAME, because those words
# say nothing about one-offness and are exactly what gets typed by reflex.
#
# WHAT IS NOT REFUSED: a written sentence that happens to contain one of those
# words. The check fires only when the reason is DOMINATED by the assertion —
# strip the matched words and fewer than three substantive words remain. "This
# is important" is refused; "super-critical one-off: the design system every
# screen inherits" is not. Judging a REAL reason's merit is not a machine's job,
# and a guard that tried would be refusing the founder's own greenlight.
#
# NOTE: hooks are snapshotted at session start. This one is INERT until the next
# session — it assumes nothing about being live in the session that adds it.

set -eo pipefail

# --- ROOT RESOLUTION -------------------------------------------------------
# TWO ROOTS, NEVER ONE. The full contract, and why the old single-root
# resolution was wrong the moment the engine became loadable by reference,
# is in scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. This bootstrap block is byte-identical
# in every hook that needs a root; contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R asserts
# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
