# contract-integrity-layer-ep.sh — LAYER EP: THE STANDING INSTRUCTION NAMES THE
#                                  CURRENT COMMAND, OR THIS FAILS.
#
# Sourced by contract-integrity-probe.sh, which owns emit_fail/emit_pass/
# emit_warn, REPO_ROOT and ENGINE_ROOT. Also RUNNABLE ON ITS OWN, because a
# layer that can only be exercised through a 49-minute suite is a layer nobody
# exercises:
#
#     scripts/hooks/contract-integrity-layer-ep.sh [--root <repo>]
#
# Exit 0 pass, 2 fail — the probe's own convention.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THIS LAYER IS FOR
# ===========================================================================
# Layer MT keeps the CAPABILITY order honest. Layer MC keeps the SPEND order
# honest. This keeps the ROUTING honest: which command a person is told to run.
#
# The three are the same shape on purpose. A fact that sessions were expected to
# remember gets declared once as data, quoted where it is relied on, and a probe
# layer refuses any drift between the prose and the declaration. MT exists
# because an orchestrator inferred a capability order from alias names. This
# exists because a capability shipped, worked, was tested, went green — and the
# announcement every session boots with kept sending traffic to the thing it
# replaced, so the new path was simply never taken. Failure type V, 2026-09-13:
# 130 s and two sequential guard refusals per session against 1.3 s through
# spawn.sh, reported as success every time, because the session did exactly what
# it was told.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS
#   1. the parser (scripts/lib/entrypoints.sh) is present — it is the only thing
#      that turns the declaration into a verdict;
#   2. the lint (scripts/entrypoint-currency-lint.sh) is present and executable;
#   3. ENTRYPOINTS is declared and WELL-FORMED — a declaration that does not
#      parse leaves the lint refusing to decide, which is correct behavior and
#      is not a check;
#   4. no standing instruction in this repository names a superseded entrypoint
#      without naming its replacement (the live run, against REPO_ROOT);
#   5. THE LINT STILL WORKS, two-sided, in a sandbox that is nobody's repository:
#      a known-bad instruction is REFUSED naming the file, and the corrected
#      string is ALLOWED. A gutted lint passes half of that; a lint that refuses
#      everything passes the other half; nothing passes both.
#
# WHY A CANARY AND NOT A HASH SIDECAR. Layers MT and MC hash their parser
# against the install manifest. This layer deliberately does not, for two
# reasons. The manifest is an explicit list inside install.sh, so adding an entry
# means the probe reads RED on a freshly merged tree until somebody re-runs
# install.sh — a known trap in this repository, and one that teaches people to
# ignore a red probe. And the protection a hash buys here is strictly weaker than
# the two-sided canary already above it: a hash proves the bytes are unchanged,
# the canary proves the behavior is intact, and only one of those is the thing
# being relied on. The omission is stated rather than hidden.
