# engine-status.sh — SessionStart hook. THE ANSWER TO "IS THIS DEFENSE ON?"
#
# WHY THIS HOOK EXISTS
# ====================
# This operation has been burned three times by defenses that reported ON while
# missing a whole failure class. The common shape is not "the guard was wrong";
# it is "nobody could tell the guard was doing nothing". A silent skip is worse
# than no guard at all, because it buys false confidence.
#
# The cure is not "block everything you cannot resolve" — applied literally that
# would brick every session in every directory on the machine, since the engine
# plugin is enabled at USER scope and therefore loads in EVERY project. The cure
# is that the defense must ALWAYS STATE WHETHER IT IS ON, in a place nobody has
# to go looking for.
#
# So this hook runs at every session start and emits:
#
#   * which ENGINE is loaded, and from where
#   * which REPOSITORY it resolved as the one it governs, and via which candidate
#   * whether enforcement is ACTIVE, STOOD DOWN, or BROKEN
#   * the count of guards that will actually run
#
# TWO CHANNELS, AND WHY BOTH ARE NEEDED
# =====================================
# `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` reaches the MODEL. It does not reach
# the human. That distinction is not academic: on 2026-08-28 an operator ran a
# real session in an adopted repository, looked at its stdout and stderr, saw no
# engine banner anywhere, and concluded the engine was not loaded. It was
# loaded, and enforcement was on — the announcement had gone somewhere only the
# model could see. "Firing silently" and "not firing" were indistinguishable to
# the one person who needed to tell them apart, which is the exact failure class
# this hook exists to remove, reproduced by the hook itself.
#
# So every status is now emitted on BOTH channels:
#
#   systemMessage                        -> the OPERATOR (Claude Code renders it
#                                           in the UI; the host's own hook schema
#                                           documents it as "Display a message to
#                                           the user (all hooks)")
#   hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext -> the MODEL
#
# The operator line is deliberately emitted for the STOOD-DOWN status too, even
# though the plugin is enabled at USER scope and therefore loads in every
# directory on the machine. One short line per session in an unadopted directory
# is the price of the guarantee, and the guarantee is the whole point: nobody
# can be unguarded without being told. There is deliberately no quiet switch —
# a mute for "this repo is not protected" is the silent skip walking back in
# through the door marked configuration.
#
# It never blocks (SessionStart hooks must not), but a BROKEN status is
# unmissable: it goes to stderr AND to the operator AND into the model's context
# AND names every candidate that was examined.
#
# LOG-ONLY / NEVER BLOCKS: always exits 0.

# --- ROOT RESOLUTION -------------------------------------------------------
# TWO ROOTS, NEVER ONE. The full contract, and why the old single-root
# resolution was wrong the moment the engine became loadable by reference,
# is in scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. This bootstrap block is byte-identical
# in every hook that needs a root; contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R asserts
# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
#
# THE BANNER BELOW GOES OUT ON TWO CHANNELS AND ONLY THE SECOND IS HEARD.
# Measured on Claude Code 2.1.270 (macOS, 2026-09-14) by registering one probe
# hook per channel on five events at once and reading the transcript back:
#
#   channel, exit 0     SessionStart  UserPromptSubmit  PreToolUse  PostToolUse  Stop
#   stderr              silent        silent            silent      silent       silent
#   stdout, plain text  model         model             silent      silent       silent
#   {"systemMessage"}   PERSON        PERSON            PERSON      PERSON       PERSON
#   additionalContext   model         model             model       model        model
#
# `silent` is not shorthand: the host records a `hook_success` attachment
# carrying the text in its stderr field and renders it to NO ONE. So a hook
# that could not find its own engine announced a dead enforcement layer
# exactly as loudly as a clean pass. Of the 60 files carrying this block, 35
# exit 2 here — where the host does render stderr, as the refusal reason — and
# 24 exit 0 and were inaudible. The 24 are the notices and observers, which is
# the trap: the hooks that must never block are the hooks nobody could hear.
#
# WHY `systemMessage` AND NOT `additionalContext`. additionalContext must name
# its own event in the envelope, and this block is identical in hooks
# registered on eight different events — it cannot know which one it is on.
# `systemMessage` is event-agnostic and it reaches the operator rather than
# only the model, which is the right audience for "your guards are off".
# Measured too: adding it to an exit-2 hook leaves the refusal untouched —
# same `hook error:` tool result, same blocked write — and only adds a render.
# Nothing here changes what any hook detects, refuses, or exits with.
#
# The escaping is deliberately pure bash (verified on 3.2.57, the macOS system
# shell) and calls nothing external: this is the one code path in the engine
# that runs when the install is already known to be broken, so it must not
# depend on python3, jq, or any file it has just failed to find.

# --- THE GUARD FRACTION ----------------------------------------------------
#
# TWO DIFFERENT QUESTIONS, DELIBERATELY NOT THE SAME QUERY:
#
#   denominator  what will the HOST LOAD? -> hooks/hooks.json, the registration
#                surface. Derived, never typed (scripts/lib/registered-hooks.sh
#                carries the full history of why).
#   numerator    of those, how many are actually ON DISK and EXECUTABLE?
#
# Collapsing these into one query would produce a fraction that is always full
# and therefore says nothing. The gap between them IS the signal: a guard the
# host will register whose file is missing or non-executable shows up here as a
# SHORTFALL, at session start, in front of the operator.
#
# A count is still not proof of wiring — contract-integrity-probe.sh owns that
# — but a count that has fallen is a cheap, visible signal that something is
# missing, available a whole probe run earlier.
#
# THE ANNOUNCER IS DELIBERATELY NOT COUNTED. This file is registered in
# hooks.json alongside the guards, and excluding it is a decision, not an
# oversight:
#
#   * it guards nothing — it announces, and the noun in the line below is
#     "guards";
#   * its own term in the fraction could never be anything but satisfied. If
#     engine-status.sh were missing or non-executable there would be no banner
#     to read the fraction in. Padding a reassurance fraction with a term that
#     cannot fail is precisely the pathology the two drift incidents produced,
#     rebuilt on purpose.
#
# The exclusion is computed from THIS FILE'S OWN NAME, so it is one line and it
# cannot go stale — it is not a list of exceptions, which would be the same
# hand-maintained record walking back in through a different door. Note that
# the probe's BR2/BR4 count EVERY registered script, announcer included; their
# subject is the registration, not the enforcing set. Deliberately no number
# here: this comment read "all 16 registered scripts" while the derivation
# three lines below returned 26 — a hand-typed count going stale inside the one
# file whose entire argument is that counts must be derived. Found 2026-08-30.
# If you are about to write a figure into this file, that is the reason not to.

# 2026-09-10. `installed_plugins.json` named a plugin cache directory as this
# engine's installPath; that directory was REAL, two days stale, and missing
# four scripts. The hooks demonstrably executed the LIVE checkout instead —
# provable because finish rows carried a field only the live ledger writer can
# produce — but the operator joined "stale directory" to "a fix producing no
# output" into a story he told the CEO before verifying it. His own words:
# "I inferred causation from a stale directory without establishing that
# anything reads it."
#
# The banner already named the resolved ENGINE_ROOT, which is the fact that
# settled it. It did not name that engine's HEAD, so "which engine, exactly"
# needed a second command. It does now, and that is the whole change.
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: a comparison against installed_plugins.json.
# It was written and removed. It needs a JSON parser inside a SessionStart
# hook, and it differs LEGITIMATELY in every engine-development session — a
# worktree of the engine is not the installed copy — which is the population
# that reads this banner most, so it would be wallpaper within a day. The
# failure it would guard against was not a missing warning; it was reasoning
# from a record without establishing that anything reads it. The running path
# and its HEAD, stated plainly, is the answer to that.

# THE SPAWN INSTRUCTION — ONE COMMAND, NOT FOUR
# ===========================================================================
# 2026-09-13. `scripts/spawn.sh` landed the night before and does the whole
# thing in one command, evaluating every PreToolUse[Agent] guard from every
# surface and reporting ALL failures together before anything is created. It
# was not used. The reason was here: this string — the first instruction every
# session reads — still named the four-step path and had never heard of
# spawn.sh. Following it that night cost 130 s and two guard refusals that
# spawn.sh would have reported together, before a workspace existed. The CEO,
# for the fourth time: "Spinning up the first agent in a new session still
# takes over 3 minutes! I thought that fuckshit was supposed to have been fixed
# at the end of the last session?"
#
# A tool nobody is told to use is a tool that does not exist. So the one
# command is the INSTRUCTION and the old path is named only as a fallback.
#
# WHAT DELIBERATELY DID NOT CHANGE: what any guard ACCEPTS. The four-step path
# still works and is still allowed — this is a change to what we TELL people,
# never to what is permitted. engine-status.test.sh case 7 fails if this string
# stops naming spawn.sh, or names prepare-agent-spawn.py ahead of it.
