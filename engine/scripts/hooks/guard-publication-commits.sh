# guard-publication-commits.sh — BLOCKING PreToolUse guard on the Bash tool.
#
# The write-time half of this pair (guard-publication-writes.sh) sees content an
# agent AUTHORS. This half sees content that is about to become HISTORY,
# whatever produced it.
#
# WHY BOTH, AND WHY THIS ONE IS NOT OPTIONAL
# ------------------------------------------
# Of the 2026-08-29 leak, THREE files were agent-authored briefs — the write
# hook would have caught those. ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-SEVEN were not: they were
# whisper output, ffmpeg measurements and analysis-tool results, produced by
# `tools/run.sh` and friends. No Write tool ever touched them. A PreToolUse
# [Write] guard would have reported a clean session and let every one of them
# through, and the land would have been, on its own terms, telling the truth.
#
# That is the same shape as the "18/18 suites" defect: a check whose scope
# quietly excluded the thing that was actually broken. So the predicate is
# re-run where provenance stops mattering — against the staged INDEX, at
# `git commit`. `git mv`, `cp`, an editor, a generator, a script, another
# agent's leftovers: the index sees all of them identically.
#
# WHY COMMIT AND NOT PUSH: by push time the bytes are already in history, and
# removing them needs a rewrite and a force-push — which is precisely the
# expensive, dangerous remedy the 2026-08-29 removal commit had to defer. A
# commit is free to refuse. A push is not.
#
# THE INDEX IS NOT THE WHOLE ANSWER — measured 2026-08-30. This hook runs
# BEFORE the command it is inspecting, so for
#
#     git add docs/session-notes && git commit -m notes
#
# nothing is staged yet at the moment of the check. The first version read only
# `git diff --cached`, found an empty set, and exited 0: `git add X && git
# commit`, `git add -A && git commit` and `cd repo; git add . ; git commit` ALL
# passed with a wholly-new directory of transcripts in the working tree. So did
# `git commit -m x <path>`, which commits a tracked file's WORKTREE content
# without it ever entering the index.
#
# So the set is derived from what the COMMAND will do, not only from what the
# index already holds: every `git add` in the same command, before the commit,
# in THIS repository, contributes its pathspecs, and so do pathspecs given to
# `git commit` itself. That enumeration uses `git status --porcelain -z
# --untracked-files=all`, and the `-uall` is load-bearing: without it git
# reports a wholly-new directory as ONE entry (`?? docs/session-notes/`), which
# is a path the scanner cannot read bytes out of. A new directory of
# transcripts committed in one go must be refused, and one flag is the
# difference between that and a clean report.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER, said plainly: `git merge`, `git cherry-pick`,
# `git am` and `git rebase` create commits without running `git commit`.
# Merge is the acceptable gap — the content it carries was gated when it was
# committed on the source branch, which is the whole point of gating commits.
# The others are genuine holes and they are named here rather than discovered.
# A `git add` in a SEPARATE tool call is not a gap: by the time the commit runs,
# its files are in the index and the index half sees them.
#
# NO LIVE OVERRIDE — DELIBERATELY. Every other Bash-matcher guard in this engine
# offers an in-prompt escape token (worktree-remove-ack:, main-checkout-run:).
# This one does not, and that is the point: the thing that failed three times in
# a row was in-the-moment human judgment about whether a particular payload was
# safe to publish. An in-the-moment override would rebuild exactly that. The way
# through is ALLOWLIST in .publication-boundary — committed, diffable, reviewed
# by whoever lands it — or a gitignored destination.
#
# PRECISION: fires only on a command that actually contains `git commit`.
# Everything else on the Bash matcher passes untouched, at the cost of one
# regex.
