# session-start-escalations.sh — SessionStart hook. AN ESCALATION RAISED IN A
#                                 SESSION THAT HAS ENDED IS THE FIRST THING THE
#                                 NEXT SESSION IS TOLD.
#
# The predicate is scripts/lib/escalations.py. This file is the wiring and one
# design decision, and the decision is the whole file.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY A SessionStart HALF AT ALL — the two days
# ===========================================================================
# The turn-end notice (notice-escalations.sh) covers the session the escalation
# is raised in. It cannot cover the case that actually happened: on 2026-09-02
# two teammates raised escalations, THE SESSION ENDED, and they were found on
# 2026-09-04 by a worktree cleanup. Everything that could have surfaced them
# died with the session.
#
# So the ledger lives outside every session (see escalations.py on why not the
# session team directory), and this hook reads it before anything else happens.
# An escalation raised on Wednesday is announced on Thursday, on Friday, and
# every session after that, until somebody acknowledges it. Nothing decays,
# nothing expires, and no cleanup has to be the thing that finds it.
#
# ===========================================================================
# TWO CHANNELS, BOTH, ALWAYS
# ===========================================================================
# engine-status.sh's rule and its measurement: `hookSpecificOutput.
# additionalContext` reaches the MODEL and nothing else; `systemMessage`
# reaches the OPERATOR. An escalation announced only to the model is one the
# orchestrator may summarize away — which is the class of thing that already
# happened to the CEO's own prepared questions. One announced only to the
# operator is one the orchestrator does not know it owes an answer to.
#
# THE MODEL'S HALF CARRIES THE WHOLE ESCALATION — title, teammate, state, age,
# audience, the question, what was tried, what is proceeding meanwhile. Not a
# count and not a pointer. A count is something to acknowledge and get past;
# that is exactly how "13 items waiting" demoted the CEO's list on 2026-08-31.
# The lead gets the words the teammate wrote, without opening anything and
# without merging anything.
#
# IT ANNOUNCES NOTHING when there is no engine here, when the ledger is empty,
# or when every escalation has been acknowledged. Silence is the healthy state
# and is never spent on saying so.
#
# NEVER BLOCKS (SessionStart hooks must not), always exits 0.

# --- ROOT RESOLUTION -------------------------------------------------------
# TWO ROOTS, NEVER ONE. The full contract, and why the old single-root
# resolution was wrong the moment the engine became loadable by reference,
# is in scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. This bootstrap block is byte-identical
# in every hook that needs a root; contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R asserts
# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
