# worker-started-handoff.sh — SubagentStart hook. LOG-ONLY; never blocks.
#
# The second of the four worker-lifecycle emitters. Appends one JSON line per
# observed worker START to the same durable stream the creation hook writes:
#
#   -> <team dir>/worker-events.jsonl   (fallback: ~/.claude/worker-events.jsonl)
#
# Full stream contract + the per-state observability table:
#   docs/worker-lifecycle-events.md
#
# WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE EVENT FROM "created". Creation and start are two
# genuinely different observations and the harness reports them separately.
# PostToolUse[Agent] fires when the spawn call returns — for a backgrounded
# teammate that is an acknowledgement ("launched"), and the worker's own turn
# has not necessarily begun. SubagentStart fires from inside the worker's own
# execution, and carries the worker's agent_id and agent_type in the payload.
# Collapsing the two would have meant asserting one from the other, which is
# the inference this whole slice exists to avoid.
#
# WHAT IT CLAIMS. Exactly: "the harness began running the subagent with this
# agent_id". Nothing about progress, nothing about success, and — critically —
# nothing about the worker still being live at read time. A worker is live only
# as "started, with no later terminal event", and the terminal events have
# their own emitters.
#
# NOT ONLY TEAMMATES. SubagentStart fires for every subagent the host runs,
# including short read-only helpers that are not delegated "AI workers" in the
# UX-design sense. This hook does not editorialize about which is which — it
# records agent_type verbatim and leaves the classification to the consumer,
# because a filter applied here would be an opinion baked into an evidence log.
#
# ATTRIBUTION IS REQUIRED, NEVER GUESSED. The event is written ONLY when the
# payload carries an agent_id. An unattributable start cannot be joined to the
# worker it belongs to, and an unjoined "some worker started" would inflate any
# active count with an anonymous phantom. No agent_id -> no line.
#
# NEVER BLOCKS, ALWAYS EXIT 0 — same contract as every sibling handoff hook: a
# session must never stall because logging failed. SubagentStart is a blockable
# event for hooks that want to be; this one never is. Env override for tests:
# WORKER_EVENTS_TEAMS_DIR.
