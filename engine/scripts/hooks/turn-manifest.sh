# turn-manifest.sh — NON-BLOCKING Stop hook. It prints, at the end of every
# turn, the tool calls that turn made and THE STATUS EACH ONE ACTUALLY
# RETURNED — generated from the results, never written by the assistant.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS
#   The orchestrator's recurring failure is reporting the strongest reading of
#   a narrow result: "Message queued for delivery at its next tool round"
#   reported as "I've told him"; no tool call at all reported as "dispatching
#   it rather than queuing it"; one glob matching 18 files reported as "18/18
#   suites". Every one of those was caught by the CEO reading the reply, which
#   makes him the detection mechanism for the orchestrator's own claims. That
#   is the last unmechanized failure class he has actually been hit by, and it
#   has to fire without him.
#
# WHY IT IS NOT A DETECTOR — the design is the point
#   Nothing here reads the assistant's prose, scores it, or decides whether a
#   sentence overstates. There is no threshold and no interpretation, so the
#   false-positive rate is ZERO BY CONSTRUCTION. It does not CATCH an
#   overstatement; it makes one UNSUSTAINABLE, because the true status is
#   printed directly beneath the claim. Unrepresentable rather than
#   detectable.
#
#   Judging the prose is a real job with a real owner: guard-unresolved-
#   claims.sh, which measured its own precision (17% for the prose signal —
#   report-only; 0 false positives on 262 SHA citations — blocking) before it
#   was allowed near a verdict. If a future edit to THIS file starts asking
#   whether a claim was fair, the edit belongs in that one instead.
#
# IT NEVER BLOCKS. Every path exits 0. A manifest that can refuse a turn needs
#   an opinion about which turns deserve refusing — which is the prose
#   judgment this hook exists to avoid.
#
# WHERE THE TEXT GOES — established by running it, not by assuming
#   A Stop hook reaches the OPERATOR by writing {"systemMessage": "..."} to
#   stdout and exiting 0. Verified against the shipping binary 2.1.251 both
#   statically (the command-hook runner lifts `systemMessage` out of the
#   hook's parsed stdout and the consumer yields a `hook_system_message`
#   tagged with the event; the binary's own bundled docs name the pattern
#   under "Stop hook that displays message to user") and LIVE (a headless run
#   with one such Stop hook produced
#   {"type":"system","subtype":"informational","content":"Stop says: …"} after
#   the assistant's final text). Multi-line survives; the host prefixes EVERY
#   line with "Stop says: ", which is why the rows are kept narrow.
#   engine-status.sh already reaches the operator this same way.
#
# FAIL OPEN, like every Stop hook here, for the reason in the sibling's
#   header: a Stop guard that fails CLOSED refuses to let the SESSION END and
#   re-fires until the binary's block cap gives up while the operator watches
#   a wedged session. A missing resolver, an unadopted repo, an absent
#   python3, an unreadable transcript — all end the turn.
#
#   The one thing it will not do quietly is DEGRADE. "Could not build the
#   manifest" is rendered as an explicit UNAVAILABLE notice, because silence
#   is indistinguishable from "this turn ran no tools", and those two facts
#   must never look alike.
#
# WHEN IT TAKES EFFECT
#   Hooks snapshot at session start. Installing this changes nothing in the
#   session that installs it; it begins rendering in the NEXT session.
#
# Exit code: 0, always.
