# guard-resume-isolation.sh — BLOCKING PreToolUse guard on the SendMessage
# tool. Closes the "resume bypasses worktree isolation" hole.
#
# THE FAILURE MODE:
#   A SendMessage to a *completed* teammate RESUMES it from its transcript.
#   The spawn-side guard (guard-worktree-isolation.sh) only fires on
#   PreToolUse[Agent] SPAWNS — it never sees a resume. So if the resumed
#   teammate's worktree was already landed and REMOVED (the single-writer land
#   sequence removes a teammate's worktree after shutdown), the agent wakes with
#   NO isolated workspace and improvises: today a hand-rolled worktree
#   (tolerable), tomorrow main-checkout writes or lost work. This guard makes
#   that IMPOSSIBLE by default: a resume that cannot be proven to land in a live
#   workspace is blocked, with the two sanctioned paths spelled out inline.
#
# THE CONTRACT (default-deny, fail closed, one auditable escape hatch):
#   1. Recipient is a currently-ACTIVE teammate — positive liveness: present in
#      the session team roster (config.json members[]) with a non-terminal
#      status, OR owning an existing (present) native worktree (its cwd under
#      .claude/worktrees/agent-* still on disk) -> ALLOW silently. An active
#      agent trips NEITHER block path because one of those two signals always
#      holds for it (see resolver below).
#   2. Recipient would RESUME a non-active/completed teammate (roster status
#      terminal AND/OR its worktree already removed) -> BLOCK, unless the
#      message carries an explicit  resume-ack: <where writes land + why safe>
#      live line (the deliberate escape hatch for pure-question follow-ups or
#      serialized external-repo writers). resume-ack: -> ALLOW + append the ack
#      line + recipient + timestamp to .claude/state/resume-acks.log.
#   3. Recipient resolution failure or ambiguity -> BLOCK (fail closed).
#   4. NEVER blocked: the lead / reply channel (to == main / team-lead / lead /
#      user / empty) and PROTOCOL messages (shutdown / plan-approval / permission
#      control traffic — detected by a non-string `message` structured body or an
#      explicit protocol type/token).
#
# SendMessage PreToolUse payload:
#   { "tool_name": "SendMessage",
#     "tool_input": { "to": "<name-or-agentId>",
#                     "message": "<text>" | {<structured protocol object>},
#                     "summary": "<preview>", "messageType"?: "<type>" },
#     "session_id": "<uuid>" }
# `to` is matched against the same roster the tool resolves against, and we
# handle BOTH the plain-name and raw-agentId addressing forms.
#
# HARNESS-VERSION NOTE: the roster/member schema and the "cwd under
# .claude/worktrees/" liveness signal are harness-version-coupled. This guard
# assumes the schema documented in orchestration.config (SESSION_TEAMS_DIR). If
# a future harness changes it, update the resolver below — the guard fails
# CLOSED, so a schema drift blocks (with resume-ack: as the override) rather
# than silently waving resumes through.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED: python3 unavailable, an unparseable payload, or an
# unreadable/absent team config for a specific-teammate recipient are all
# blocked (never waved through) — with resume-ack: available as the operator
# override where a deliberate resume is genuinely safe.
#
# NOTE: hooks are snapshotted per session; this guard takes effect from the
# NEXT session. It assumes nothing about being live in the session that adds it.

# Fail-closed, not fail-open: every payload check below depends on python3 to

# --- (1/2/3) LIVENESS RESOLUTION — TWO SOURCES, ONE OF THEM AUTHORITATIVE
#
# THE DEFECT THIS SECTION EXISTS TO CLOSE — measured 2026-09-02
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The lead sent in-flight notices to three agents that scripts/agent-liveness.sh
# had confirmed ALIVE seconds earlier by the authoritative signal (isolation
# worktree LOCKED, locking pid running). This guard refused all three — by
# teammate NAME and by raw agentId — with "could not be confirmed as an ACTIVE
# teammate (not in session roster)".
#
# It was not a bug in the matching. It was the SOURCE. This guard decided
# "active" from the session team roster, and CLAUDE.md documents that background
# native-isolation agents NEVER appear in that roster: "Background
# native-isolation agents don't appear in the SendMessage roster — absence !=
# terminated." So the roster cannot distinguish "completed and cleaned up" from
# "running but invisible", and this guard failed closed on both. Every notice to
# a live background agent had to be waived — not occasionally, STRUCTURALLY,
# every single time. A guard that must be overridden every time it fires is a
# guard nobody reads, and the override becomes reflex.
#
# THE PROTECTION IS UNCHANGED AND MUST STAY THAT WAY. A SendMessage to a
# genuinely completed teammate resumes it from its transcript; if its worktree
# was already landed and REMOVED it wakes with no workspace and improvises —
# main-checkout writes, lost work. That is still blocked, and the two-sided
# canaries in guard-resume-isolation.test.sh prove both directions at once.
#
# THE FIX: consult the AUTHORITATIVE liveness signal before refusing.
#   roster  — cheap, advisory, checked FIRST because a hit is free and covers
#             every in-process teammate. An ACTIVE roster answer allows, exactly
#             as before. It is never trusted to REFUSE on its own.
#   lock    — scripts/lib/agent-liveness.py, THE ONE implementation of "is this
#             agent alive?", consulted on the refusal path only. It already
#             returns ALIVE / NOT-ALIVE / INDETERMINATE with its evidence, and a
#             second implementation here is how one of the two silently becomes
#             the stale one. Read its docstring: the lock pid is the HOST
#             SESSION's pid, shared across every agent of that session, so the
#             lock's PRESENCE is the per-agent signal and the pid check is the
#             stale-lock filter.
#
# INDETERMINATE IS NOT "ALLOW". It stays a real outcome and it keeps requiring
# the ack — a resolver that collapses "I could not tell" into "fine, go ahead"
# is the failure this whole engine keeps finding in itself.
#
# WHY A LOCKED, PRESENT WORKTREE IS NOT A WEAKENING: this guard has ALWAYS
# treated a present worktree as positive liveness regardless of a stale roster
# status (see wt_present() below — "A present worktree is positive liveness").
# The lock is a strictly STRONGER signal than mere directory presence. The only
# thing that changes is that an agent the roster never listed can now produce
# that evidence too.
#
# Resolve the team config the SAME way the SendMessage tool resolves `to`: the
# session team dir under SESSION_TEAMS_DIR/session-<first8>. Tests override the
# teams dir via RESUME_GUARD_TEAMS_DIR. EXACT session match only (never a
# single-dir fallback) so a mismatched/absent session never resolves to an
