# Mutation harness for guard-worktree-isolation.sh, CLAUSE 5 (the staffing gate
# — M1-M11) and CLAUSE 6 (the model-tier gate added the same evening — M12-M19;
# see the block below its own header for why the INCIDENT is a mutant here).
#
# Clause 5 (the staffing gate
# added 2026-09-02 after an engine-wide audit was dispatched to `Explore`, a
# generic built-in, because a roster teammate would have needed a worktree
# created first).
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. Clause 5's suite is 37 green cases. Green is not
# evidence: on 2026-09-02 five separate checks in this engine were found green
# over code that never ran, including a mutation harness that killed 11 of 18
# mutants because its sandboxes lacked a dependency, so the guard REFUSED TO
# START and that read exactly like a guard catching the mutation. Each mutant
# below therefore asserts THREE things, not one:
#   (a) the mutation actually applied     -- a sed that matched nothing gives a
#       green run that looks like a green run;
#   (b) the guard STILL STARTS AND RUNS   -- a control payload (a well-formed
#       isolated roster spawn, which no clause-5 mutant should touch) must still
#       exit 0. A guard that refuses to start exits 2 on everything and would
#       "catch" every mutation while proving nothing;
#   (c) the suite goes red AT THE NAMED CASES, not merely somewhere.
# EVERY MUTANT RUNS IN A THROWAWAY COPY OF THE WHOLE ENGINE. This line used to
# read "there is no sandbox copy anywhere in this harness: every mutant runs
# the REAL file from the REAL engine root, so the missing-dependency trap
# cannot recur." That was a real trap and the wrong cure, and it cost more than
# it bought:
#
#   On 2026-09-05 an engineer working in this repository watched this harness's
#   `-gt` -> `-lt` mutant (M13, the INCIDENT) sitting in the SHIPPED
#   guard-worktree-isolation.sh in a live tree — the spawn gate enforcing the
#   exact inverse of the CEO's model ceiling, refusing upgrades and waving
#   downgrades through. This run finished, so `trap ... EXIT` put it back.
#
# AN `EXIT` TRAP IS A PROMISE CONDITIONAL ON EXITING. `kill -9`, an OOM kill, a
# closed terminal or a power cut between the two writes leaves the operator's
# live enforcement inverted with nothing to say so, and `~/.claude/richos-
# engine` is a symlink to the main checkout. This harness is also invoked by
# contract-integrity.test.sh, so that window was open on every CI verify, not
# only when somebody ran it by hand.
#
# THE MISSING-DEPENDENCY TRAP IS ANSWERED THREE WAYS, none of them a promise:
#   1. the sandbox is the whole mechanical layer (scripts/, hooks/,
#      orchestration.config, .claude/), not one file — see
#      scripts/lib/mutation-harness.sh, whose header carries the full account;
#   2. `alive` below is unchanged, and it is the arm that tells "caught the
#      mutation" apart from "could not start";
#   3. M0 runs the whole suite against the UNMUTATED sandbox and REFUSES TO
#      PROCEED unless it is green — so a deficient sandbox is a loud failure at
#      case zero rather than 21 mutants all scoring PROVEN for the wrong
#      reason. That is the measurement the old sentence asserted instead.
# And M99 witnesses the shipped guard's checksum AND mtime across the whole
# run: not "restored correctly" but NEVER OPENED FOR WRITING.
#
# BOTH DIRECTIONS ARE MUTATED. Under-blocking is the obvious one (M1-M4, M8,
# M9, M10). Over-blocking has its own mutants (M5, M6, M7) because the cheapest
# way to make any guard "pass" is to make it refuse everything, and the cheapest
# way to kill a false positive is to disable the check -- an over-broad staffing
# gate that fires on a statusline change is how a defense becomes a nuisance and
# then a formality typed by reflex.
#
# ONE FINDING FROM THIS HARNESS'S OWN FIRST RUN, kept here because it is the
# whole argument for writing it: M9 originally mutated the `: "${GENERIC_AGENT_
# TYPES:=general-purpose}"` DEFAULT and the suite stayed green. The guard sources
# the entity's orchestration.config BEFORE that line and the config sets the
# variable explicitly, so the default is dead code in any adopted repository.
# The mutant had proven nothing and looked like it had proven the opposite.
