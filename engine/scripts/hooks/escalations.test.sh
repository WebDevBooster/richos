# escalations.test.sh — the suite for the escalation channel:
#                       scripts/lib/escalations.{py,sh}, scripts/escalate.sh,
#                       scripts/hooks/notice-escalations.sh and
#                       scripts/hooks/session-start-escalations.sh.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THIS SUITE HAS TO PROVE, AND WHY EACH HALF EXISTS
# ===========================================================================
# The claim is not "a file was written". THAT WAS THE OLD MECHANISM, and it
# worked perfectly: on 2026-09-02 two teammates wrote `BLOCKED.md`, committed
# it, and the files sat unread until a worktree cleanup found them on
# 2026-09-04. A test that asserted "the escalation file exists" would have been
# green through the entire incident.
#
# So every case here asserts ARRIVAL, and the two hardest ones are built to
# reproduce the incident rather than the happy path:
#
#   CASE 3   THE BRANCH IS NEVER MERGED AND THE WORKTREE IS DELETED. This is
#            the incident, mechanically. If the escalation still arrives in
#            full, delivery does not depend on a merge — which is the whole
#            defect being fixed.
#   CASE 6   NOBODY ACKNOWLEDGES IT AND A DAY PASSES. If the notice went quiet
#            after announcing once, this mechanism would have reproduced the
#            two-day silence with a better audit trail. The age bucket must
#            make it speak again, LOUDER, and a new session must re-announce
#            it from scratch.
#
# TWO-SIDED THROUGHOUT. A checker that reports everything gets muted in a week;
# a checker that reports nothing passes every test it has. So the positive case
# has a negative twin one variable away, and case 12 is an explicit NEGATIVE
# CONTROL that rebuilds a mechanism which reports "clear" over an outstanding
# escalation — if the suite cannot go red there, cases 4 and 5 prove nothing.
#
# Usage:  scripts/hooks/escalations.test.sh [-v]

# ERREXIT DELIBERATELY OFF. Most commands here are EXPECTED to exit non-zero —
# `list` is exit 1 when something is outstanding, a refused `raise` is exit 2 —

# how a suite reports green over the half it never reached.

# ===========================================================================
# THE LEAK CANARY — THIS SUITE MUST WRITE NOTHING OUTSIDE ITS OWN SANDBOX
# ===========================================================================
# On 2026-09-05 a fixture from case 14 was found as an untracked file in a
# working engineer's worktree:
#
#   docs/verification/escalations/2026-09-05-zach-opus-e1corrupt-a-good-row-
#   beside-a-bad-one.md
#
# It reads exactly like a live escalation — an id, a `from:`, a HEAD sha, a
# "close it with" command — and the engineer who found it could not tell it
# from a genuine one. He was right to refuse to commit it, and he spent part of
# a handoff explaining a file he had not written.
#
# The cause was one argument away from a fix that was already in the file. This
# suite redirects the LEDGER into its sandbox with RICHOS_ESCALATION_LEDGER,
# but `escalate.sh raise` writes a SECOND output — the markdown record — whose
# path comes from --worktree, and --worktree DEFAULTS TO THE CURRENT DIRECTORY.
# Most of the raise calls passed it. One did not.
#
# THAT IS THE GENERIC DEFECT, AND IT IS WHY THIS EXISTS AS A CANARY RATHER THAN
# AS THREE CORRECTED LINES: a test that redirects ONE output to a sandbox while
# a SECOND output still follows the working directory is invisible in review,
# because the redirect that IS there reads as care. Three corrected lines are a
# fix. This is the guarantee — the fourth call, added next month by somebody
# who copied one of the five that were already right, is caught the day it
# lands instead of by a stranger reading a handoff.
#
# WHAT IT WATCHES, STATED RATHER THAN IMPLIED:
#   - the INVOCATION ROOT: the git toplevel of the directory this suite was
#     started in, or that directory when it is not a repository. That is
#     exactly where the 2026-09-05 fixture landed, because run-all-tests.sh
#     does not cd and every suite inherits the operator's working directory.
#   - the ENGINE'S OWN ROOT, when that resolves to a different tree.
#   - the operator's REAL escalation ledger, in case a subprocess ever ignores
#     RICHOS_ESCALATION_LEDGER.
#
# AND WHAT IT DOES NOT, because a canary that overstates its reach is the same
# lie in the other direction:
#   - NOT gitignored paths inside a git root. The snapshot is `git status`, so
#     build output churning under another agent cannot turn this red — at the
#     cost that a leak into a gitignored path is missed. Such a leak would also
#     be invisible to the engineer this protects, which is the trade being made.
#   - NOT the rest of the filesystem, and NOT $HOME beyond the one ledger file.
#     A canary claiming to watch $HOME would be claiming something it cannot
#     check in the time a suite is allowed to take.
#
# ITS ONE FALSE-POSITIVE VECTOR, named so nobody has to rediscover it: another
# writer adding a NON-ignored file to the same checkout while this suite runs
# is indistinguishable from a leak, and case 17n will name it. That is the
# right trade — the failure prints the path, so a reader sees at once that it
# is not an escalation record, whereas the opposite trade (staying quiet to
# avoid the noise) is the whole defect. It is also why 17o counts FIXTURE rows
# in the real ledger rather than total rows: there, a concurrent real
# escalation is likely enough that a total-row check would be false-alarming
# regularly, and a check that cries wolf gets muted.
#
# A ROOT IT CANNOT READ IS A FAILURE, NEVER A QUIET PASS. An unreadable root
# yields an empty snapshot both times and therefore an empty diff, which is the
# "green over something that never ran" shape this engine keeps finding. So the
# health of the baseline is recorded when it is taken, and case 17f refuses to
# report a pass without it.

#
# EVERY UNTRACKED ENTRY CARRIES A WITNESS OF ITS CONTENTS, and that is not
# decoration. The first version of this canary compared PATHS ONLY, and was
# caught on the day it was written: run it twice against a checkout with the
# leak still present and THE SECOND RUN REPORTED CLEAN. `raise` derives the
# record filename from the date, the teammate and the title, so every run
# writes the SAME path — run one's file was already in the baseline, run two
# overwrote it, nothing was new, and the canary announced a clean sheet over a
# leak happening in front of it. A canary that only catches the FIRST
# occurrence goes quiet exactly when residue proves it is needed.
#
# Tracked files need no witness: `git status` already reports them as ` M `
# when their contents change. It is the `??` entries that are invisible.
#
# The witness is a checksum AND, where the platform can give one, an mtime.
# The escalation id is a timestamp with one-second resolution, so two raises

# witness on GNU, and the mtime half of this canary would be dead while looking
# alive. That is the defect class this whole change is about, so the candidate
# is accepted only if it returns a NUMBER that actually CHANGES when the same
# file is written twice. A second-resolution format fails that and is
# correctly rejected: it could not have distinguished the same-second case
