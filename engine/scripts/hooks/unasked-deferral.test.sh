# unasked-deferral.test.sh — the unasked-deferral notice, end to end, in a
#                            sandbox, driven through the SHIPPED hook.
#
# WHAT IS ASSERTED, AND WHY EACH CASE EXISTS
#   1. THE SPECIMEN. The verbatim 2026-08-31 turn — the one the CEO had to ask a
#      third time about — produces a notice that QUOTES the construction.
#   2. THE THREE DISCHARGES. AskUserQuestion in the turn; the CEO's hand visible
#      in the text; an Agent spawn in the turn. Each silences the SAME specimen
#      text, so the silence is provably the discharge and not a hook that never
#      ran (case 2d re-runs the specimen bare and demands the notice back).
#   3. ORDINARY SEQUENCING PROSE IS SILENT. Real sentences from the corpus that
#      describe a PIPELINE — "the deploy runs after the merge", "Ray goes after
#      Tom", "I'll report when it's done" — must produce nothing. This is the
#      precision half and it is the reason the family list is short.
#   4. QUOTED IS NOT USED. A turn that QUOTES the trigger phrases — which is
#      what a turn describing this guard does — stays silent, with a positive
#      control proving the same words unquoted still fire.
#   5. IT REPORTS, NEVER BLOCKS. Exit 0 in every case above.
#   6. IT CAN BE SEEN GOING QUIET. Stood down, no analyzer, unresolvable root —
#      each says so on the systemMessage channel rather than dying silently.
#   7. STATE-CHANGE DE-DUPLICATION. The same deferral restated is announced
#      once; a DIFFERENT one speaks again.
#
# NEGATIVE CONTROLS ARE MANDATORY HERE. A suite for a regex guard passes
# trivially if the matcher is broken — everything is silent and every silence
# case is green. So every silence assertion in section 3 is paired with the
# specimen firing in the same run, and section 1 runs first.
#
# Run directly:  scripts/hooks/unasked-deferral.test.sh [--verbose]
# Exit 0 = all green.

#    found — everywhere else a degraded payload produced silence.
