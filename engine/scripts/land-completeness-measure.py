"""land-completeness-measure.py — G0. THE NUMBER, BEFORE ANYTHING BLOCKS.

===========================================================================
WHY A MEASUREMENT SCRIPT SHIPS AT ALL
===========================================================================
`docs/plans/land-completeness-2026-09-10.md` R6 says any blocking behavior is
measured against real lands on this machine before it ships, and the measured
false-positive rate is stated. This project killed three guards in one day
(`g11`/`g12`/`g13`) by making them broad enough that waiving became the daily
habit, so a rate is not a formality here — it is the thing that decides whether
the gate ships armed, ships reporting-only, or does not ship.

A rate quoted in a report is a claim. A rate a reader can re-derive with one
command is evidence. That is the only reason this file is committed rather
than being a throwaway in a scratch directory.

    engine/scripts/land-completeness-measure.py --projects ~/.claude/projects

===========================================================================
WHAT IT MEASURES, AND THE PART THAT IS NOT RECONSTRUCTABLE
===========================================================================
A land, in this engine, is `git merge` into the watched branch from the main
checkout (`skills/rich-lander/SKILL.md`; the same act `guard-ci-red-lands.sh`
already classifies). A land is COMPLETE when the worktree whose branch it just
merged is gone. The steps in between — collect artifacts, remove the worktree,
resolve the branch — are the ones with no gate on them.

So this reads orchestrator transcripts and, per session, pairs each land with
the worktree-removal traffic that follows it:

  lands                 `git merge` calls, classified with shlex rather than
                        matched as a substring, dry runs excluded.
  removal steps         `remove-agent-worktree.sh`, `git worktree remove`,
                        `collect-worktree-artifacts.sh`, or a
                        `reconcile-terminal-worktrees.py` run — any of the
                        sanctioned ways the residue actually goes away.
  a land LEFT RESIDUE   no removal step appears between it and the next land
                        in the same session.

That loose predicate is a CEILING and it is reported as one. The SHIPPED gate is
narrower: it fires only when a registered worktree's owner is judged NOT-ALIVE
**and** its branch is already merged. The second term is free here — the residue
of land N-1 is merged by construction, because land N-1 is the merge. So the
entire distance between the ceiling and the real rate is one question:

    WAS THE OWNER OF THAT WORKTREE STILL ALIVE WHEN THE NEXT LAND HAPPENED?

That is the question the orchestrator gets wrong when it guesses, and it is why
`scripts/lib/worktree-ledger.py` exists. At run time the gate answers it against
the live process table. Retrospectively the process table is gone — but two
durable records survive that answer it for a past instant, and this script uses
both:

  the ledger      ~/.claude/state/worktree-ledger.jsonl is append-only and
                  timestamped. A `registered` line maps a branch and a worktree
                  path to an agent id, a session id and that session's pid. A
                  `terminated` line is a WITNESSED death with a timestamp on it.
  the agent's own
  transcript      <session>/subagents/agent-*<agent-id>*.jsonl. Its LAST entry
                  is the last moment that agent demonstrably existed. If that
                  moment is AFTER the land being judged, the owner was alive
                  then, full stop, and the tight gate would not have fired.

THE THREE-VALUED ANSWER IS KEPT THREE-VALUED. An owner with no registration, or
one whose transcript cannot be found, is UNKNOWN — and an unknown owner is
counted as a NON-FIRE, because the shipped gate refuses only on a fact it
established. Rounding unknown to residue here would inflate the very number the
CEO is being asked to decide on.

Under-counting is possible too, in one specific way: a session that lands once
and stops leaves residue that no LATER land in that session can be measured
against. Those are counted separately as `trailing` and are neither a fire nor
a pass.

===========================================================================
WHAT A FALSE POSITIVE IS HERE — AND WHAT IS NOT ONE
===========================================================================
NOT a false positive: refusing land N because land N-1 left real residue. That
is the forcing function R2 asks for, working. The land was legitimate work and
it is still refused, deliberately, until one step that should already have
happened happens.

A FALSE POSITIVE is a refusal naming residue that was not residue:

  * the worktree belonged to an agent that was STILL RUNNING — the dominant
    risk, because the orchestrator routinely lands one branch while its author
    is still working. Counted here from the agent's own transcript.
  * the branch was UNMERGED, which R3 says is never swept and must never block.
    Impossible by construction in this simulation and excluded in the shipped
    gate by an explicit clause.
  * the worktree was already gone — removed by the nightly reconciler, by a
    prior session, or by a path this script cannot see. Counted as unknown, not
    as a fire.
