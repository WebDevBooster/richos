# ceo-asks-status.sh — what the CEO-ask gate can see, and what it would do.
#
# The predicate, its rationale and everything it cannot catch live in
# scripts/lib/ceo-asks.sh. This is its command-line face: the answer to "why did
# it block me / why is it not blocking anything?" that a person can run in one
# line and get the SAME verdict the hooks get, because it is the same code.
#
#   scripts/ceo-asks-status.sh                 # the repository you are in
#   scripts/ceo-asks-status.sh /path/to/repo   # a specific governed repository
#   scripts/ceo-asks-status.sh --session <id>  # as of one session's ledger
#
# Without --session it reports what is PREPARED, with nothing discharged — the
# state of a session that has just opened.
#
# EXIT CODES, and the third exists so "nothing to ask" and "cannot tell" are
# never the same signal:
#
#   0  nothing prepared, or every prepared item has been put to him
#   1  OPEN — a prepared item has not been put to him in this session
#   2  BROKEN or NOT-DECLARED: no verdict was reached
