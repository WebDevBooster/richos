# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
# ===========================================================================
# "All 18 suites green" was the sentence quoted at every land, and 18 was the
# size of one glob — `scripts/hooks/*.test.sh`. There were 23 suites. The five
# outside that glob (scripts/demo.test.sh, scripts/locate-engine.test.sh,
# scripts/provision-claude-md.test.sh and the two under scripts/lib/) were not
# failing quietly; they were not being RUN.
#
# On 2026-08-29 two of those five were red on main, and had been for a day:
#
#   scripts/demo.test.sh          scripts/demo.sh — the buyer-facing 60-second
#                                 proof — exited 2 during setup, printing no
#                                 reason, on any machine that ran it.
#   scripts/locate-engine.test.sh case 6a, "install.sh mints the pointer",
#                                 FAILED.
#
# Both had the SAME cause: install.sh had started deriving its hook inventory
# from hooks/hooks.json, and two consumers did not provision it. Both were
# caught by a suite that already existed and already asserted the right thing.
# Nothing ran either suite, so the land reported 18/18 and was, on its own
# terms, telling the truth.
#
# This is the engine's own founding defect one level out. scripts/lib/
# registered-hooks.sh exists because a TYPED list of guards drifted twice in two
# days while the banner reported a full, reassuring fraction over it. A typed
# list of test suites is the same object. So this runner does not have one:
#
#   THE SUITE INVENTORY IS DISCOVERED FROM DISK, NEVER TYPED, NEVER GLOBBED
#   AT ONE DIRECTORY. A suite added anywhere under the engine is run by the
#   next invocation with no edit here, and cannot be silently excluded from
#   the fraction it is counted in.
#
# NO SILENT DEGRADATION: finding zero suites is a hard failure, not "0/0 green".
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY THIS ONE STAYS IN CI, AND WHAT THAT COSTS — measured 2026-08-30
# ===========================================================================
# Every other honour-system check in this engine has now been moved to a
# PreToolUse chokepoint, because a check that runs when somebody remembers is a
# rule enforced by attention. The obvious next question is whether this runner
# should join them. THE ANSWER IS NO, AND IT IS ARITHMETIC RATHER THAN TASTE.
#
#   28 suites, one full sequential run, this machine:   439s  (7m19s)
#   the two that dominate it:
#     scripts/hooks/contract-integrity.test.sh          313s   (98 cases)
#     scripts/hooks/by-reference.test.sh                106s   (48 cases, each
#                                                              building TWO)
#   everything else, all 26 suites together:            ~40s
#
# RE-MEASURED 2026-09-04, and the arithmetic got worse while the ATTRIBUTION
# above turned out to be wrong. contract-integrity.test.sh is now 165 cases and
# 2978s -- 49.6 minutes on its own. The case count grew 1.7x; the wall clock
# grew 10x. The parenthetical that used to sit on this line said each case
# builds a whole sandbox repo, as though that were the cost. It is not:
#
#   sandbox construction, all 85 builds                  3.8s   (0.1%)
#   19 cases that are each a WHOLE OTHER SUITE          2348s   (70%)
#     of which 10 *.mutation.sh harnesses               2168s   (65%)
#   the probe itself, ~10s x ~80 invocations             ~800s   (~24%)
#
# A mutation harness runs a guard's entire behavioral suite once per mutant, so
# it costs N times that suite. WTI1 alone is 599s. That is not waste -- it is
# the work that makes a green tick load-bearing -- but it means the suite's cost
# tracks the number of MUTANTS, not the number of sandboxes.
# Full account: docs/measurements/integrity-suite-cost-2026-09-04/.
#
# A seven-minute pause before every `git commit` is not a guard, it is an
# outage. The engineer would remove the hook within the hour, and then NOTHING
# would run the suites — strictly worse than the honour system it replaced. A
# guard people disable protects nothing.
#
# THE 40-SECOND SUBSET IS ALSO REJECTED, and this is the less obvious half. It
# is affordable, and it is exactly the wrong 26: the two suites it would drop
# are the two that verify the guard REGISTRATION SURFACE — that the hooks are
# wired, once each, on the right event, present, executable and hash-matched.
# Those are the checks that answer "is the enforcement actually on?", which is
# the only question a commit-time gate has any business asking. A subset that
# skips them is the "18/18 suites" defect rebuilt on purpose: a fast, green,
# reassuring fraction over the set that does not include the thing most worth
# checking.
#
# SO THE COST OF LEAVING IT IN CI, STATED RATHER THAN GLOSSED: a red suite can
# reach `main` and sit there until CI runs. That risk is bounded by what the
# suites are FOR — they verify the engine's own machinery, which changes only
# when somebody is deliberately editing the engine, and that person is running
# the suite they are editing. It is NOT the risk that bit us on 2026-08-30:
# publication-completeness went red on a DOCS merge, by an author who had no
# reason to think any check applied to them. That is the class a chokepoint
# fixes, and it is now fixed — see guard-completeness-commits.sh.
#
# WHAT WOULD CHANGE THIS ANSWER, so it can be re-decided on evidence rather
# than re-argued: get contract-integrity.test.sh and by-reference.test.sh under
# ~10s combined, and the whole runner becomes chokepoint-affordable. Until then
# it stays in ci-verify.sh step 3, which is where the numbers say it belongs.
#
# This sentence used to end "(their cost is sandbox construction, which is
# cacheable)". Sandbox construction HAS now been cached -- built once, cloned
# per case -- and it bought 92 seconds of 3070, because it was 2.9% of the run
# rather than the whole of it. The distance between ~10s and 2978s is the
# mutation harnesses, and closing it means running independent mutants
# concurrently, not copying fewer files. Nobody should re-derive that from the
# suite's shape: it is measured, and the measurement is on disk.
#
# WHAT DID CHANGE, and it is the part a developer feels: the suite now takes
# --only <section>. A one-line change to one guard costs that guard's section --
# 21s to 181s, typically about 50s -- instead of 49.6 minutes. A scoped run
# exits 3, never 0, so nothing in this runner or in any gate can mistake one for
# a full pass. This runner invokes every suite with no arguments, so what it
# gets is still, always, the full pass.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE LEAK CANARY, PER SUITE — added 2026-09-05
# ===========================================================================
# A suite is supposed to write only inside its own sandbox. Two findings on one
# day showed that "supposed to" was carrying the whole guarantee:
#
#   - escalations.test.sh wrote a fixture into whatever directory it was
#     started from. It was found as an untracked file in a working engineer's
#     worktree, reading exactly like a live escalation. He could not tell it
#     from a real one. The suite reported 59 passed, 0 failed on every leaking
#     run. The cause was one argument away from a fix already in the file.
#   - two mutation harnesses mutated the SHIPPED guards in place — including
#     guard-worktree-isolation.sh, the spawn gate — and restored them with
#     `trap ... EXIT`, which does not survive `kill -9`. Both are invoked by
#     contract-integrity.test.sh, which this runner runs.
#
# THE SECOND ONE IS WHY THIS LIVES HERE AND NOT ONLY IN EACH SUITE. If a
# tracked engine file changes DURING this run, the suites that ran before the
# change and the suites that ran after it tested DIFFERENT CODE, and the
# fraction printed at the bottom is a green tick over an inventory that never
# existed in one state. That is this engine's founding defect, one level out
# again — so it is a failure here, not a warning.
#
# IT IS TAKEN PER SUITE, NOT PER RUN, and that is the whole usability of it: a
# once-per-run check says "something in these 68 leaked" and leaves somebody a
# bisection; per-suite NAMES THE CULPRIT. The cost is two `git status` calls
# per suite, about 40 seconds across a 50-minute run.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, so nobody reads more into a green run than is there:
# gitignored paths (deliberate — build output and state dirs churning under
# another agent must not turn this red), and anything outside the watched
# checkouts. Global state OUTSIDE every repository — the `richos-engine`
# pointer, user-scope settings — is a different problem with a different
# answer: scripts/lib/global-state-witness.sh, which watches named paths rather
# than trees. The two do not overlap and neither subsumes the other.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE RECORD CANARY, PER SUITE — added 2026-09-11 (round 15)
# ===========================================================================
# The third problem, found three times in two days after the paragraph above
# was written: a suite writing into the OPERATOR'S RECORD under $HOME — the
# ownership ledger, the platform's fallback event log, the team directories.
# The last instance was the shipped SessionStart reaper, run by a green suite
# with a sandbox entity and an unredirected HOME, appending a `terminated`
# witness for a REAL agent whose shell was locked by a running pid. Each
# instance was fixed in its suite with a both-arms control; this runner now
# baselines those three paths before every suite and fails the suite that
# changes them, so the class is closed at the runner rather than re-found per
# suite. scripts/lib/record-canary.sh says exactly what it witnesses and the
# one thing it cannot (the platform's own per-turn `finished` rows).
#
# ITS FALSE-POSITIVE VECTOR, MEASURED RATHER THAN GUESSED. 2026-09-05, 49
# minutes of 10-second sampling with 68 agents live on the machine:
#
#   the shared main checkout   288 one-minute windows, 0 red
#                              252 seven-minute windows, 0 red
#   an engineer's OWN worktree  17% red at one minute, 50% at seven,
#   while he was editing it     because he was saving files in it
#
# So the noise is self-inflicted and self-explaining — the report names the
# file and the engineer recognizes his own save — and it is NOT the "another
# agent broke my run" flakiness a runner-level canary was feared for. Agents
# work in worktrees; only the lander writes to the shared checkout. It is also,
# in that case, TRUE: a suite that ran before the save and one that ran after
# it did test different code.
#
# WHAT THAT WINDOW DID NOT CONTAIN, said rather than glossed: a land. The last
# merge to the observed checkout was six minutes before sampling began, so the
# 0% figure is NOT evidence about a merge arriving mid-run. That property is
# proven mechanically instead, in leak-canary.test.sh case 5a, which lands a
# real merge commit under a live canary and requires silence.
#
# ===========================================================================
# PER-SUITE TIMING — added 2026-09-10
# ===========================================================================
# This runner printed PASS and FAIL and nothing else, so every wall-clock claim
# ever made about it came from OUTSIDE it: an agent watching a terminal, or a CI
# run log read days later. The cost of that is in the record rather than
# hypothetical — the "2977.9s" figure quoted into three plans was stale, the
# attribution above was wrong once already ("their cost is sandbox
# construction"), and two adversarial reviews on 2026-09-09 had to re-derive the
# distribution from transcripts because the runner would not say.
#
# So it says. Every suite line carries its duration, and every run ends with a
# slowest-N tail and the summed suite time. `--timing-tsv PATH` writes
# suite/ms/verdict/clock for anything that wants to diff two runs.
#
# THE NUMBER NAMES ITS OWN CLOCK. `date +%s%3N` is a GNU extension that BSD
# `date` answers with the literal string `17889976023N`, and the operator's
# /bin/bash is 3.2.57 with no `$EPOCHREALTIME`. scripts/lib/stopwatch.sh probes
# for a clock that returns thirteen digits and prints which one it got, because
# a duration table with no stated precision is how a one-second granularity gets
# quoted to three decimal places.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/run-all-tests.sh            run everything, quiet on success
#   scripts/run-all-tests.sh --verbose  stream every suite's full output
#   scripts/run-all-tests.sh --list     print the discovered inventory, run none
#   scripts/run-all-tests.sh --timing-tsv PATH   also write a timing TSV
#
# Environment:
#   RICHOS_TIMING_TSV    same as --timing-tsv
#   RICHOS_TIMING_TAIL   how many rows in the slowest-N tail (default 10, 0 off)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every discovered suite passed and none wrote outside its sandbox
#   1  at least one suite failed, or leaked (each is named, with its output)
#   2  no suites discovered, or the engine root is unreadable — refusing to
#      report a green fraction over an inventory of nothing
