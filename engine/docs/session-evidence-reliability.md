# Reliable session evidence

The shell evidence hook enables `errexit` and `pipefail` before each Bash tool
command. A failed test followed by `; echo done`, or piped through `tail`, now
fails the tool call. Other tool arguments, including background execution and
timeout, are preserved. The hook does not grant permission or execute commands.

It uses the official [PreToolUse updatedInput contract](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks#pretooluse-decision-control).
It is registered in both the seated engine settings and the plugin hooks.
Restart/resume Claude Code after installing to load the new registration.

Expected nonzero outcomes belong in explicit control flow:

```sh
if command > 'command.log' 2>&1; then
    cat 'command.log'
else
    command_status=$?
    cat 'command.log'
    exit "$command_status"
fi
```

Use the original command's status. A trailing filter, `echo` or `cat` must not
stand in for it. The shell's explicit if/else, AND/OR and subprocess semantics
still apply. A script that itself swallows a failure can still exit zero.
Reading a log is evidence retrieval, not a rerun of its tests.

The turn manifest now calls plain Bash output RETURNED and explicitly says
individual commands/checks were not verified. Structured tool errors remain
ERROR. This prevents a successful shell wrapper being labeled as successful
inner work.

Input handovers include authored files. The ingress excludes directories, devices,
OS executables, Claude settings/state and automatic task-notification/system-reminder
envelopes. A shared file predicate is used by ingress and historical rechecking. Its follow-up reader
also rechecks historical system-resource and Claude task-output entries, so they stop
creating notices without editing the original ledger. Real untracked documents,
symlinks and refusals continue through their existing safety checks.

For Cargo output, `app/scripts/rust-test-summary.py path/to/cargo.log` separates
ordinary passes, ignored cases and documentation passes. A log with no ordinary
test result is an error. Failed suites exit 1. The summary explicitly does not
attest the original cargo process exit status or log completeness.

Verification:

- `scripts/hooks/session-evidence.test.sh` reproduces hidden failures in Bash
  and Zsh, tests argument preservation and inspects real ingress ledger output.
- `scripts/hooks/ceo-inputs.test.sh` checks existing handover safety and recovery.
- `scripts/hooks/turn-manifest.test.sh` includes its seven negative controls.
- `scripts/hooks/guard-stated-actions.test.sh` checks the manifest consumer.
- `scripts/hooks/unevaluated-payload.test.sh` checks every registered hook.

The six focused negative controls in `session-evidence.mutation.sh` restore each
failure in an isolated copy. Each corresponding regression must fail. The source
worktree and live engine are never mutated by that runner.

Read-only replay against the incident ledger removed all 68 false handover entries
without editing that ledger. The positive controls still retain a real untracked
document and pass file symlinks to the existing refusal gates.
