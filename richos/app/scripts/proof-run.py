"""proof-run.py — RUN a proof-for.sh selection: concurrently, admitted by CPU, one summary.

    proof-run.py [proof-for arguments]          e.g.  origin/main..main   |  --working  |  <sha>
    proof-run.py --commands <file>              a saved `proof-for.sh --quiet` output
    proof-run.py --resume <run-directory>       retry a frozen plan, preserving valid results
    options:
      --fail-fast          cancel independent unfinished work after a failure (opt-in)
      --keep-going         compatibility alias for default continuation
      --dry-run            print the plan (items, lanes, expected seconds) and run nothing
      --as-printed         run the printed commands exactly as printed, one after another (the
                           hand-written loop's shape, to measure what the runner saves)
      --capacity N         the run's budget of concurrent WORKERS, nested ones included
                           (default: 80% of logical cores — the admission line, in cores)
      --engine-shards N    at most N engine shards (default: logical cores / 2)
      --admission-wait S   how long the Mac may refuse one check before it is NOT ADMITTED
                           (default 1800 s); time queued behind this run's own checks does not
                           count (refusal_counts)
      --slot-wait S        how long this RUN may wait for a proof-run slot on this Mac (default
                           10800 s; see RUNS SHARE THE MAC below)
      --budget S           a check running past S seconds is named while the run goes (600)
      --deadline S         a check still running at max(S, 3 x its expected seconds), capped
                           at an hour, is stopped with its whole tree and fails (1800)
      --cap S              a HARD cap instead: every check, engine units included, is stopped
                           with its whole tree at S seconds, whatever it was expected to take
                           (TIMED-OUT, "stopped at its S s cap"). The merge gate passes 600.
      --run-cap S          the whole run stops at S seconds: running checks are stopped with
                           their trees and waiting ones never start, all `cancelled` with the
                           reason, and the summary is written as for any other end. Unset: none.
      --sample-every S     how often the host is sampled for the run's summary (10)
      --log-dir DIR        an empty directory for evidence (default: per-checkout SSD storage
                           on macOS; retain failed/unfinished runs and the last 3 green runs)
    There is no low-priority switch: CEO ruling §78's mode is for the native app build, and a
    runner of tests never skips the CPU line.

      --summary-out F      also write summary.json to F (the land gate reads its verdict there)
      --without-nightly-conditions
                           run every check in the caller's environment only, to tell whether a
                           failure comes from the nightly's conditions (below). Refused inside
                           the land checks (RICHOS_AUTOCHECK_ACTIVE): the merge gate always
                           meets them.
Exit: 0 every check passed; 1 a check failed, timed out, was not admitted, the run was not
admitted to a proof-run slot within --slot-wait (every check is then `not-admitted` in the
summary, which is written all the same), or proof-for.sh
found a changed code path no suite covers (nothing is run then); 2 usage or an unreadable
selection; 3 nothing failed, and at least one check was NOT RUN (see below). 3 is not 0: a
caller that reads any non-zero exit as "not green" stays right.

A CHECK THAT DID NOT RUN IS NEVER RECORDED AS PASSED (2026-09-29). The land of
cc/zach-opus-autocheck1 recorded `front-door` and `gui-boot` as `passed` while their logs said
"0 of 1 suites passed — 0 checks — 1 NOT RUN (no screen)": run-tests.sh exits 0 for a suite
it deliberately did not run, and exit 0 was all this runner read. Now every run-tests.sh check
is given `--results-out` in this run's log directory and its state is read from that file, the
same per-suite record the nightly puts into build-info.json: a suite recorded `notrun` (no
screen), `gap` (a declared host gap) or `skipped` (RUN_TESTS_SKIP_UNCHANGED) makes the check
NOT RUN, a state of its own, with the reason ("no-screen", "host-gap", "unchanged-inputs") in
progress.json, outcomes.json, summary.json (`result: not-run`, `not_run: {why, suites}`), the
live line and the final line. A run-tests.sh check that exits 0 without writing that file is
`invalid`: it cannot show that it ran. What a caller does with NOT RUN is the caller's
decision; the land gate's is in autocheck/README.md.

The same holds for a UI suite run directly (`cd richos/app/ui/tests && node <suite>.js`,
2026-09-30, hunt part 2 finding 18): it is given the evidence ledger run.js gives its children
(RICHOS_UI_TESTS_LEDGER) and its state is read from it. A suite that recorded only a skip
(lib/harness.js skipSuite) is NOT RUN (`suite-skipped`); one that exits 0 with no check or a
failed check in its ledger is `invalid`.

A CHECK MEETS THE NIGHTLY'S CONDITIONS BEFORE THE NIGHTLY DOES (2026-10-01). Five nightly
attempts in one night each failed on a suite that had passed for its engineer; two of them
only because the build hands its suites what an engineer's shell does not: a long TMPDIR
(cargo-cache-env.test.sh, "path must be shorter than SUN_LEN") and RICHOS_IOS_POOL_WAIT
(merge-check-scope.test.py, KeyError). So a check of a suite a nightly gate runs (a
`run-tests.sh --only` suite the desktop build runs, by run-tests.sh's own `--for desktop
--list`, and a UI suite run directly) gets what that gate would give it, from nightly-local.py
gate_conditions(): the build's TMPDIR, PATH and every variable it sets for that gate, its own
check-specific values (item.env) still winning. Derived, never copied: a value added to the
build reaches these checks with no edit here. The plan prints which checks run under which
gate's conditions and anything this machine cannot reproduce. Phone-app suites, cargo, engine
units and anything else no desktop gate runs keep the caller's environment.

A RETRY ON THE SAME TREE RUNS ONLY WHAT DID NOT PASS (2026-09-29). `--resume` and every new run
reuse a validated pass whose input identity is unchanged (lib/proof_evidence.py). A check with
a reviewed contract in proof-inputs.json is keyed by the inputs it declares; every other check
is keyed by the whole checkout's content (WHOLE_CHECKOUT there), so a refused land tried again,
or the push after it, never re-runs a check that already passed on that exact content.

Two gaps kept that promise from the merge gate until 2026-10-02 (the land of
cc/zach-opus-e2fix1, 214 checks, refused four times with no check failing; every retry re-ran
what had passed). Engine units without a reviewed contract (91 of the 214) were `fresh`, never
reused, and now take the whole-checkout identity like every other unqualified check; the
coverage proof still re-reads each one (proof_evidence.verify_target_receipts). And a check's
identity carried --admission-wait, --slot-wait and --engine-slot-wait, so the gate's retry
(900 s) matched nothing its first run (893 s, what was left of the gate) had passed: those
bound how long a check may wait to START, never what it runs, and are no longer part of it.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-23). Verification exposed unbounded nested workers, descendants
surviving timeouts and failures that were discovered only after long waits. This runner
owns scheduling, admission, logs and cancellation so callers do not reconstruct that protocol.

WHAT IT DOES WITH EACH FAMILY OF COMMAND, and why nothing is dropped:
  * engine `ci-shard.sh --only-units <u>` lines retain ONE full units file and the
    engine planner's shard assignment. Each shard lane admits one exact unit at a time,
    releasing its worker permit between units. Each unit leaves its own receipt; a
    final `ci-shard.sh --verify-receipts` proves the union of units run equals the set
    selected. A unit that silently did not run fails the land, as it does in CI.
  * `run-tests.sh --only a --only b ...` becomes one `run-tests.sh --only <suite>` per
    suite, so every suite is scheduled, timed and logged on its own. Each keeps
    run-tests.sh's own semantics (declared host gaps, NOT RUN without a screen).
  * `cargo test` lines share one Cargo target, whose lock would serialize them anyway;
    they run in one lane, and a filter already matched by a shorter filter for the same
    target is dropped only because cargo's filter is a substring match (`phone::` runs
    every test `phone::attachments::` names).
  * everything else runs as printed.

WHAT MUST NOT RUN AT THE SAME TIME, and how that is decided (derived, never typed):
  * lane `cargo`   every cargo command (one target directory, one lock);
  * lane `gradle`  every app suite that drives bin/randroid (one Gradle project);
  * lane `guest`   every host-screen suite when RICHOS_GUI_HOST names the test VM (one
                   guest slot at a time from this lane; run-suite.sh boots it through run-walk.py);
  * iOS suites own their devices. Shared simulator limits serialize boots and cap live devices;
    per-cache locks prevent independent runs from replacing one another's build or device state.

A FAILING CHECK IS NAMED BY WHAT FAILED IN IT (2026-09-25). Each check gets a results folder in
this run's log directory (RICHOS_TEST_RESULTS_ROOT); run-tests.sh gives each suite one under it,
and a test run copies its per-test result files there the moment it ends (lib/test_results.py),
so a later check writing the same build folder cannot erase them. The failing tests' names are
printed when the check ends and again beside it in the summary, and written to summary.json.
The run that made this necessary: `native-android-app` failed "133 tests completed, 1 failed",
and `native-android-ui` replaced the one report naming the test before anyone read it.

ENGINE SHARDS SHARE THIS CHECKOUT. In CI each shard had a machine of its own; here they run side
by side in one tree. Every unit still has ci-shard.sh's leak canary, so a write outside a sandbox
is still caught; what changes is attribution: a leak by a unit in one shard can also be charged
to whatever unit another shard is running at that moment. The run is red either way; read both.

REFERENCE (T3 Code adoption ledger, richos-hq docs/research/t3code-tooling-what-to-adopt-2026-09-19.md):
§2.3 "shard across runners, not workers" — COPIED as receipted engine shards and one simulator
per iOS shard, because on one Mac with CI paused the separate "runners" are processes and
simulators. §2.4 "every CI job capped at 10 minutes" — COPIED as a budget enforced while the run
goes: named live at --budget, stopped with its whole tree at the deadline. Their CI workflow
files themselves are NOT APPLICABLE (CI paused).

ADMISSION, TWO CONDITIONS, BOTH CHECKED BEFORE EVERY START:
  * A FREE WORKER TOKEN (scripts/lib/worker_tokens.py, engine). The run has --capacity tokens and also uses the shared machine ceiling;
    each check holds one while it runs, and the budget's directory is exported to it as
    RICHOS_WORKER_TOKENS, so a nested pool (the mutation harness's eight workers, native-ios-ui's
    extra simulators) runs one worker on its caller's token and takes a token for every other.
    The count is of workers on the machine from this run, not of commands this runner typed.
    A quarter of the tokens are reserved: nested workers never take them, so a check not yet
    started always can.
  * CEO RULING §77's LINE, the same rule and the same code as testvm/reserve.py: one sample of
    total CPU (user plus system) and memory; below 80% it starts, otherwise the check waits (samples at least 30 s
    apart) and the wait is reported beside its time. --admission-wait bounds only the time the Mac
    refused it while nothing of this run was running; time queued behind this run's own checks,
    including a CPU or pressure refusal while they run, is reported, never charged (refusal_counts).
Checks start longest-expected first, the expectation being each check's measured median, so the
long poles are not the ones left waiting; under --cap (the merge gate) a check planned past the
cap is not started (start_key, leave_over_cap, MEDIAN_SAMPLES). While the
run goes, a sampler records total CPU and the tokens held; the summary prints both, which is the
evidence of host use, not a guarantee that running compilers stay under the admission line.

THE MACHINE BUDGET for separate runners and nightlies is shared through worker_tokens.machine_directory(). Local --capacity remains an additional
ceiling. All nested workers must acquire both budgets or borrow their caller's held slot.

RUNS SHARE THE MAC (2026-09-27). The machine budget counts CHECKS, and one check (cargo, shellcheck,
xcodebuild, Gradle) can use several cores; the CPU line is one sample per check, so runs started in
the same minute each saw a free Mac and stacked. So before its first check a run takes a host-wide
proof-run SLOT (scripts/lib/proof_slots.py): measured, one run alone peaks at the whole Mac, so the
default is one run at a time, and the lead sets another number for the whole Mac with
`proof_slots.py set N`. A run over the limit waits in first-come order, recorded as a CPU-admission
wait for the lead's turn-end gate; `python3 scripts/lib/proof_slots.py status` shows who holds and
who waits. The slot is an flock the kernel drops with the run's last descriptor (the run's checks'
supervisors hold it too), so a killed run releases it once its checks are stopped. A proof run
started by a check of a proof run works inside its caller's slot.
