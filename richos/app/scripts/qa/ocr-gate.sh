#
# =============================================================================
# THE GATE'S OWN FAILURE MODE IS "0 HITS"
# =============================================================================
# A broken reader and a clean frame produce the identical answer, and it is the
# answer the gate is hoping for. So this refuses to report clean until it has
# PROVED the reader works, on a committed control image whose text is known.
# Without that proof the run exits 2 and says nothing about the frames.
#
# The control lives at fixtures/ocr-control.png in this directory. Its address
# is `qa-fixture@example.invalid` — `.invalid` is reserved by RFC 2606 and can
# never belong to anyone, so the control itself is not a thing to redact.
#
# =============================================================================
# THE LIST OF PEOPLE IS NOT IN THIS REPOSITORY, AND THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT HAVE ONE
# =============================================================================
# Five walks each wrote their own gate with its own inline list of the
# operator's names, company and handle — in a scratch script, so the roster was
# retyped from memory every time and was different every time. Moving that list
# into this file would publish it, which is worse.
#
# The project already answers this: `engine/scripts/lib/named-persons.py` holds
# the predicate, and the roster lives at `~/.richos-privacy/named-persons`,
# operator scope, refused at load if it ever resolves inside a work tree. This
# gate hands it the OCR text and adopts its four verdicts, including the one
# that matters here:
#
#   ABSENT is not clean. It means nothing was checked.
#
# On ABSENT this gate exits 2 and says so. A QA walk publishing frames is the
# release-shaped case, not the stranger-with-a-clone case: it happens on the
# owner's machine, where the list must exist.
#
# What this script owns on its own is the SHAPE patterns — an address, a
# `/Users/<name>` home path, a phone-shaped run of digits — which need no
# roster and catch the thing that actually leaked on every walk so far.
