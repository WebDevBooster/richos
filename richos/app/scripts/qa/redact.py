"""redact.py — black out what must not ship, and PROVE it is gone.

  redact.py <in.png> <out.png> [--addresses] [--box x,y,w,h ...] [--pad N]
  redact.py --help

  --addresses   find address-shaped text by OCR and cover it (the default when
                no --box is given)
  --box         cover an exact rectangle, as many times as you like
  --pad N       grow every OCR-derived box by N pixels (default 3)
  --no-verify   skip the re-scan (and say so in the output)

Exit 0 the output is clean, 1 something survived, 2 the tool could not run.

===========================================================================
UNDER-REDACTION IS THE ONLY FAILURE THAT MATTERS, AND OVER-REDACTION IS THE
ONLY WAY TO BE SURE — BUT IT DESTROYS THE EVIDENCE
===========================================================================
Seven versions of this were written across four walks, and they oscillated
between the two errors. The version that keyed on a bare '@' blacked out
'QA TEST CO' and 'Talk to Rich' — evidence destroyed, nothing proved. The
version that keyed on a strict address pattern missed addresses that
tesseract had split into two tokens across a space.

Both are fixed the same way, and it is the rule here: a word is covered when
IT, or IT JOINED TO ITS NEIGHBOR ON THE SAME OCR LINE, matches a real
address pattern. Line identity comes from tesseract's own block/paragraph/
line numbers, so 'Talk to Rich' cannot be joined into an address and
'alex @ example.com' cannot escape as three tokens.

===========================================================================
A REDACTOR THAT DOES NOT RE-READ ITS OUTPUT IS A CLAIM, NOT A REDACTION
===========================================================================
The last step is always to OCR the OUTPUT and require zero address-shaped
hits. If the box was drawn in the wrong place, or the pad was too small and
a tail of the domain survived, this is what notices. It exits 1 and names
the file rather than printing a count of boxes drawn.
