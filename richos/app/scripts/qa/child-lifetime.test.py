"""No phone needed: a stand-in idevicesyslog must END after kill -9 of phone-ios.py.

WHAT IS ASSERTED IS THAT IT ENDS, NOT HOW FAST (2026-10-05). This asserted "within 5 s" and failed
once in the merge gate (2026-10-02 16:59): the watchdog that ends the child is a Python process of
its own, and on a loaded Mac its interpreter can take seconds to start, then it polls every 0.5 s.
Reproduced by delaying every Python start by 6 s (a sitecustomize.py that sleeps): the child
ended about 6 s after the kill and the 5 s bound failed; the defect it guards against, a child
that outlives the tool, is still caught. So the bound is only an outer limit, OUTER_LIMIT seconds,
and a child that has exited but is not yet reaped (a zombie; kill(pid, 0) still succeeds) is ended.
