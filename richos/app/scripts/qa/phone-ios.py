ONLY THROUGH `rios device` (CEO, 2026-10-02: only the build users get goes on his phones and every
test on them tests it). `run`, `approval`, `procs`, `apps`, `lock`, `battery` and `syslog` touch the
phone, so they run as `rios device <command> ...` and refuse (exit 3) when started any other way;
`rios device verify` runs only the Release build and refuses a bundle carrying Debug's development
markers. `check`, `parse-log`, `summary`, `vocabulary`, `pair-steps` and `syslog-rate` touch no
phone and run directly.

The iPhone counterpart of phone-android.py. iOS 26 offers no shell on the phone, so every tap,
type, Home, lock and screenshot goes through one XCUITest check that executes a list of steps
(`PhysicalDeviceTests.testScript`). Each step prints one `PHONE_STEP` JSON line with its start and
end on the phone's clock, which this tool collects. A failed step stops the list; nothing is
retried. Validation happens here, before anything is built, so a typo costs a second, not a build.

THE APPROVAL PROMPT, AND WHY IT IS NEVER A SURPRISE. When the phone has a passcode, iOS asks
its owner (Touch ID or passcode, at the phone) to allow UI automation when a test session starts
after the phone has been idle; the session waits about 60 s and then fails "Timed out while
enabling automation mode". Apple: the prompt exists only when a passcode is set, comes back
"roughly once per day", and cannot be automated (developer.apple.com/forums/thread/693273).
Measured on this Mac's 108 sessions (2026-09-27 to 10-01): never asked within 12.5 min of the
previous session, always asked after 9.3 h or more, and NOT triggered by reinstalling the runner
(about 100 back-to-back sessions each re-installed it without asking; a 9.7 h idle asked with the
very same products). A phone dedicated to testing is kept without a passcode, so nothing asks;
`run` still forecasts before it builds anything (`approval` prints the same forecast), and
REFUSES a run that is expected to ask unless --approval-announced says the CEO was told first.

First launch of a newly signed development app can require Apple's online verification.
On the physical SE on 2026-09-27, Xcode reported an untrusted certificate but the icon showed
"Unable to Verify App" and Settings had no Developer App profile. One tap on the app icon while
the phone was online resolved it. On 2026-10-02 the same refusal ("Profile Needs Network
Validation") came from the phone's Wi-Fi DNS server no longer answering it, and a restart of the
phone cleared it; the phone has no passcode, so it comes back usable on its own (CEO 2026-10-02).
So `rios device verify|run|perf|hold` restart the phone ONCE on their own when the launch is
refused this way (`rios device reboot`, phone_net.py) and go on, or say why not. Do not send the
person searching for a trust profile that is absent or repeatedly retry the unchanged refusal.

Steps are JSON objects with "do" and, where needed, "id" (accessibility identifier), "label"
(substring of the accessibility label) or "kind" ("switch" or "button": the first one), "in":
"springboard" for system UI, "tailscale" for the route's own app, "settings" for iOS Settings (this
app's permissions under Settings > Apps > RichConnect, and Wi-Fi: set back what you change) or
"safari" for the one share-sheet source, "timeout" (s) and "optional": true (a failure is logged,
the list continues). `tree` and `shot` keep the "in" app's window; `launch` and `terminate` with
"in" start that app fresh on its first page or close it (never SpringBoard); "kind" with "label" is
that control itself (a Settings permission row's inner toggle, not the row: a tap at the row's center
does not toggle it). Settings builds its rows lazily, so a row below the fold is not found until
scrolled; reach this app's page through the app's own "iPhone permissions" row. A list that touches Tailscale may
not take a shot, tree or audit: that screen is the person's own account. Settings' first page names
the phone's Apple Account, so `ocr-gate.sh` every Settings frame before it enters a record.

                                  the phone. Record the starting value and set it back before the end.
    orientation{set: portrait|landscapeLeft|landscapeRight|portraitUpsideDown}
                                  turn the phone; the step reports the app window's size, so a
                                  portrait-only app is seen to stay upright. End on portrait.
    open{url}                     an https link, opened as a person's tap opens one: in Safari
                                  (test content only, e.g. an isolated lab's own image).
    tapThen{after, at: [x, y]}    tap the target and, `after` seconds later (0-2), touch screen point
                                  `at`, as one synthesized event record: a touch at an exact moment
                                  of an app's return (`perf.py ios --tap-returns`). A `tap` step's
                                  detail also carries `tapAt`, the phone-clock moment it was asked for.

An "id" names the FIRST element carrying that identifier (SwiftUI repeats a container's identifier
on its children).

`launch` may carry Apple's own text-size override (`textSize`, a UIContentSizeCategory name) and
nothing else: the app under test stays the Release app. `audit` records XCTest's accessibility
audit of the screen as it is.

`lock` presses XCTest's lock button, and NOTHING in a script can open the phone again: measured on
an iPhone SE, iOS 26.3.1, with no passcode set (2026-09-24), XCTest's Home press wakes the lock
screen but does not open it, and XCTest cannot start its runner on a locked phone at all ("Device
test exceeded its time limit"). So a `lock` step must say `"person": true` (a person is at the
phone to press Home), and there is no `unlock` step. `shot` keeps only the app unless "screen": true, so nothing else on a person's phone lands
in a record by accident; run `ocr-gate.sh` on any frame before it enters a record.

Environment for `run`: RICHOS_IOS_DEVICE (the hardware UDID xcodebuild accepts) and
RICHOS_APPLE_TEAM. `procs`, `apps`, `lock` and `battery` take --device (devicectl identifier or
UDID). Prints one JSON document; exits 1 when the phone answered "no" (a step failed) and 2 when
it cannot answer at all, with the sentence in `error`.
