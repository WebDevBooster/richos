# gui-launch.sh — build a complete machine, and boot the shipped binary on it the way
# LaunchServices boots it.
#
# Sourced by `gui-boot.test.sh`. It is a library and not a suite: everything here is
# MACHINERY, and every VERDICT lives in the suite, where a reader looking for what is
# asserted finds it in one file.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE CONDITION, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# `ps eww` on a real Finder double-click of RichOS.app on this machine carries exactly:
#
#   HOME=/Users/alex  USER=alex  PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
#
# and the working directory is `/`. That is recorded in
# `docs/verification/loro-write-path-2026-09-01/` and in `engine.rs`'s module doc, and it is
# the whole reason three separate components resolved their configuration out of variables
# that were not there. `env -i` reproduces it exactly: nothing is inherited, so a variable
# this harness does not name cannot rescue the boot the way a developer's shell does.
#
# `/usr/bin/open` is NOT used and must not be: it forwards the CALLER's environment, which is
# how every boot log in this repository before 2026-09-01 came to be a developer's launch
# wearing a double-click's clothes (commit 8b7ca41).
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THE BINARY IS COPIED OUT OF THE REPOSITORY BEFORE IT IS RUN
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# `engine.rs`'s candidate 4 is "the nearest ancestor of the EXECUTABLE holding an engine/".
# A binary sitting in `app/src-tauri/target/debug/` satisfies it, so a boot from there finds
# an engine no matter how badly the resolution is broken for a customer — the dogfood
# checkout answers on the executable's behalf. Every boot log in this repository so far was
# taken that way, and each one says `via repo layout above the executable`.
#
# So the binary is copied to `<machine>/Applications/RichOS.app/Contents/MacOS/richos-tauri`
# first. Candidates 4 and 5 then miss, and the engine has to be found the way it is found on
# a customer's Mac: through `<home>/.claude/richos-engine`, candidate 6.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# AND WHY IT IS A REAL BUNDLE AND NOT A DIRECTORY SHAPED LIKE ONE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# For nine days it was the latter, and the boot died on its first line. `gui_bundle_plist`
# below carries the full diagnosis; the short version is that once `main()` began calling
# `update_startup::prepare`, a `.app` with no `Contents/Info.plist` stopped being a launch
# this product would complete. A harness that boots something the product refuses is not
# testing a launch, and — worse — its NEGATIVE cases keep passing, because a boot that never
# happens looks exactly like a boot that failed for the reason each of them broke.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL, AND WHAT IT COST NOT TO HAVE IT
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Until 2026-09-10 this harness copied the executable into `RichOS.app/Contents/MacOS/` and
# wrote NO `Info.plist` — a directory shaped like a bundle that was not one. That was fine
# until `01e9b8d8` put `update_startup::prepare` at the top of `main()`: it takes the bundle
# root around the executable (`activation::bundle_root`, a pure path-shape test that this
# layout satisfies) and then reads `Contents/Info.plist` (`richos_user_update::bundle_plist`,
# lib.rs:570-575). There was no such file, so `prepare` returned `Err`, `main` printed
#
#     [richos] application startup: No such file or directory (os error 2)
#
# and returned. Every boot in this suite died at line one. B1 and B2 went red — and B3-B8,
# the six negative halves, went GREEN over the same dead boot, because a machine that never
# boots is indistinguishable from a machine with its engine pointer removed. Measured on
# 2026-09-10 against `7272ecf8`: `3 FAILED, 18 passed`, six of those passes false.
#
# THE KEYS ARE NOT A LIST SOMEBODY MAINTAINS. `C2` below extracts the `Info.plist` keys the
# product's own `bundle_version` reads out of `richos-user-update/src/lib.rs` and asserts
# this function emits every one of them, so a key the product STARTS requiring makes that
# case red rather than making this file quietly insufficient. Drift lengthens the list.
#
# The file-shape rules `bundle_plist` enforces beyond parsing (a regular file, one link,
# under 1 MiB, no group- or other-write bit, no write ACL — lib.rs:576-586) are satisfied by
# `gui_bundle` writing it and chmod 644, and asserted by `C4`.

#
# ACTIVE IS NOT ONLINE, AND THAT DISTINCTION IS THE WHOLE REASON THIS FUNCTION EXISTS.
# Apple's active display is one that is connected, AWAKE, and available for drawing. A Mac
# whose screens have gone to sleep still has every display ONLINE and has NO ACTIVE DISPLAY
# AT ALL — so the boot is told, truthfully, that there is no display to place a window on,
# prints `window: the runtime reported no attached display`, and B2 goes red over the state
# of the SCREEN rather than the state of the code.
#
# MEASURED ON THIS MACHINE, 2026-09-17, because this is not a story about what could happen:
#
#   pmset -g log        displays off 02:33:47 +0100 (01:33:47Z), on 03:16:29 +0100 (02:16:29Z)

#     ( cd / && env -i ... "$bin" >> "$out" 2>&1 ) &
#     local pid=$!
#
# and `$!` there is the SUBSHELL, not the app. `cd / && env …` is a compound list, so bash
# forks a subshell which then forks `env`, which execs the binary — and the `kill` below
# reached the first of them. The app was orphaned to PID 1 and kept running with its window.
# Measured on 2026-09-01: 157 live `richos-tauri` processes, roughly six per round across
# about twenty-six rounds, every one from a `<tmp>/…/RichOS.app` whose directory had already
# been deleted. Deleting a temp directory does not kill what is running out of it —
# CLAUDE.md's zombie-residue rule, in the exact shape the rule describes.
#
# Three changes, and each is load-bearing:
#
#   1. `exec` — the subshell REPLACES itself with the binary, so `$!` is the app's own pid.
#      One process, and the pid this function holds is the pid it needs to signal.
#   2. TERM, then a bounded wait, then KILL, then VERIFY the pid is gone. A signal sent is
#      not a process ended.
#   3. every pid is appended to `$GUI_LAUNCHED_PIDS` before the wait begins, so the caller's
#      EXIT trap can reap it even if this function is interrupted before it gets to kill it.
#      The FAILING rounds are exactly the ones that leave processes behind.
