"""proof_slots.py — how many proof runs share this Mac at once, host-wide.

    proof_slots.py [status] [--json]   who holds a slot and who waits, in line order
    proof_slots.py set N               the host's limit: N proof runs at once (Rich sets it)
    proof_slots.py set default         back to the measured default (below)

    import: acquire(meta, wait_seconds, say) -> Slot (its .fds are passed to the run's checks);
            Slot.release(); status(); limit()

WHY (2026-09-27). proof-run.py admitted each CHECK by one CPU sample and a machine budget of
checks, and neither counted RUNS. Several agents each saw a free Mac within the same minute,
each started a full selection, and the Mac fell to a few percent idle; a proof overlapped
Codex's CPU test window and ended it early. The CEO: "how many more times will this fucking
CPU shit keep happening?" and, of builds, "A free Mac is used whole; nothing waits in a line."
and "Rich sets how much runs at once."

THE LIMIT, FROM MEASUREMENT. proof-run.py's own worker budget is 80% of the logical cores (the
CEO ruling §77 line, in cores): ONE run is built to fill the admission line by itself. Measured
from the proof-run logs of 2026-09-26/27 (/Volumes/E1TB/state/richos/proof-runs/*/*/summary.json,
host samples every 10 s, 10 logical cores): 36 runs with no other proof run beside them peaked
at a median 99% total CPU and spent 62% of their samples at or over 80%; 25 runs overlapping
another averaged 85% and spent 86% of their samples over the line; 13 overlapping two or more
averaged 93% and 92%. The samples are the whole Mac, so these are upper bounds for one run. So
the default is floor(line cores / cores one run peaks at) = floor(0.8 x cores / (1.0 x cores)),
at least 1: ONE run at a time. `set N` is how the lead changes it for the whole Mac; an agent's
own flag cannot, because a limit each caller picks for itself is no limit.

HOW IT HOLDS. A slot is a file locked with flock(2) (slot-NNN); a run that holds one also locks
its holder record (slot-NNN.holder), which says who holds it. The lock FDs are passed to the
supervisors of the run's checks, so a runner killed with SIGKILL keeps its slot only until the
supervisors have stopped its checks: the kernel drops every lock with its last descriptor.
Nothing is a pid file, nothing is reclaimed by guessing.

THE LINE. A run that finds no slot free waits in first-come order: it holds a lock on its own
`wait-<ns>-<pid>-<hex>` file (the name orders the line) and only the first live waiter tries
for a slot. While it waits it is RECORDED as a CPU-admission wait (engine resource_waits.py),
naming the run it waits for, so the lead's turn end is refused once it passes ten minutes.
`status` reads the holder and waiter files and probes their locks with a shared, non-blocking
lock that it drops at once; it never touches a slot file, so looking cannot delay admission.

NESTED RUNS. A suite that runs the real proof-run.py (proof-run.test.py, test-results.test.sh)
inside a check of a proof run works inside its caller's slot: the caller exports its holder
record's path as RICHOS_PROOF_RUN_SLOT_HELD, and the nested run borrows only if that record is
held right now AND its pid is one of the nested run's own ancestors. Naming it from anywhere
else does not skip the line.
