# A BUILD CACHE IS A CHECK'S OUTPUT, NEVER ANOTHER CHECK'S INPUT (2026-09-29).
#
# The land of cc/zach-opus-autocheck1 into main (6ef73abf) was refused with
# `no-foreign-app-data` state `invalid`, "execution inputs changed during the check", while its
# own output said "3 passed, 0 failed". Its declared inputs include `richos/app/crates`; the
# lint check running beside it ran Clippy on `crates/richos-user-update`, a standalone Cargo
# package whose default target directory is `crates/richos-user-update/target`, and 536 MB of
# build products written there changed the reader's fingerprint (09:39:27, the rmeta files).
# The reader never looks inside it (foreign_app_data.py skips `target`), and nothing is
# specific to that pair: any check that builds into the tree invalidated any check whose
# declared root holds the build directory, during the check or, through finalize(), after it.
#
# So a directory that is BOTH (a) tagged under the Cache Directory Tagging Specification
# (bford.info/cachedir: a `CACHEDIR.TAG` beginning with the signature below, which Cargo writes
# into every target directory it creates, atomically with the directory) AND (b) ignored by git
# with nothing inside it tracked, is left out of every identity: not its bytes, not its
# listing, not its existence. The specification's meaning of the tag is "regenerable output";
# (b) guarantees no byte git would land is ever skipped. A directory with the tag and without
# (b), or with (b) and without the tag, is bound exactly as before, so the fingerprint still
# binds every source file, untracked fixture, bytecode file and tool it bound.

# declared inputs include `richos/app/ui`, and the UI suites running beside it write their
# per-run screenshots into `ui/tests/.shots/`. Alone it passes 3 of 3. Those directories are
# output by the repository's own declaration (their .gitignore rules say so: "Screenshot
# evidence for ONE run", shard receipts are "Evidence OF a run, never an input to one", the
# vouch download is a digest-verified cache), but the writers are node suites that do not tag
# what they write, so build_cache() could not see it. Tagging from the writers would not fix
# it either: the first run to add a tag changes the directory it tags, mid-run.
#
# So these paths, relative to the repository root, are left out of every identity on the

# A CHECK WITH NO REVIEWED INPUT CONTRACT IS KEYED BY THE WHOLE CHECKOUT (2026-09-29).
#
# Until today such a check was `fresh`: never reused, so every retry ran it again. The land
# of cc/echo-opus-speckle3 ran the same 78-check selection five times on one tree (three
# refused merges, a `--resume` whose help says it preserves valid results, and the push),
# and each time re-ran the ~70 unqualified checks that had already passed on that tree.
# A reviewed contract (proof-inputs.json) says which bytes a check reads, so its result can
# be reused across DIFFERENT trees. Without one, the only safe statement is the strongest:
# nothing git would land differs. So the identity of an unqualified check is:
#   * the checkout's CONTENT: every path git would land, with its mode and blob id, read
#     from the index where the working tree agrees and from the working tree where it does
#     not, plus every untracked file git does not ignore. Never HEAD: a merge being checked
#     and the commit that concludes it are the same content. Any byte change anywhere in the
#     checkout re-runs every unqualified check;
#   * the checkout's path (a result is never shared between worktrees: what git ignores,
#     node_modules and build products, differs between them);
#   * the command (proof-run adds it), the runner's settings, the resolved interpreters, the
#     environment variables named below, and the platform;
#   * the INSTALLED DEPENDENCIES a check runs against (installed_dependencies below).
#
# INSTALLED DEPENDENCIES ARE INPUTS (2026-09-30, hunt part 2, finding 11). This used to say
# that what git ignores and what lives outside the checkout "are the same limits a rerun on
# this Mac has". They are not: a rerun reads the dependency as it is now. A check passed with
# an ignored node_modules package, only that package changed, running the check again failed,
# and the saved pass was reused and finalized as passed. So the identity also binds, by
# content or by install identity, what a check executes that git does not track: every
# ignored `node_modules` directory in the checkout, the Playwright browser installs the UI
# suites launch, and the Rust toolchain `cargo` resolves. It still binds nothing else git
# ignores: bytecode caches, build caches, test output and hook sidecars are written by checks
# and tools as they run, and binding them would invalidate every pass on every run.

# A CHANGE INVALIDATES ONLY THE CHECKS WHOSE INPUTS IT TOUCHES (2026-09-29, part-2 hunt
# section 07).
#
# `source` is the whole checkout: HEAD, the tracked diff and every untracked file git does not
# ignore. It used to decide for every check at once: any change to it during a run marked the
# run contaminated, stopped every running and waiting check, and invalidated every pass,
# including passes whose own declared inputs had not changed by a byte. So one editor save
# anywhere in the checkout (a doc, an unrelated script) refused a land and threw away its
# evidence. Now each check is judged by its OWN identity, which already says what it reads:
#   * a check with a reviewed contract (proof-inputs.json): its declared paths, tools,
#     environment and Git inputs. A change outside them leaves its pass standing;
#   * a check with no contract is keyed by the whole checkout's content (WHOLE_CHECKOUT), so for
#     it every change IS an input change and its pass is invalidated, on its own, without
#     stopping any other check;
#   * a check with no identity at all (`fresh`: an engine unit without a contract, the receipts
#     verifier) has only the whole source to bind it, so a source change invalidates it
#     exactly as before.
# What stays global is HEAD: a commit or a checkout switch in the verified checkout is not an
# editor save, receipts are bound to the commit, and it still marks the run contaminated.
#
# One `fresh` check is not bound to the whole source: `engine receipts`. It is fresh so that it
# always runs (it is the coverage verifier over this run's receipts), not because its inputs are
# unknown: verify_target_receipts() re-reads every covered unit's own identity and HEAD itself,
# so its pass is exactly as valid as the units it covers. Binding it to the whole source would
# make one unrelated save fail the coverage of every engine unit in the run.
