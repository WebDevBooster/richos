"""ship_gate_fixture.py — a STAND-IN passing speed verdict, for a test that must run a gated build.

Every Android bundle asks the speed gate first (richos/mobile/perf/shipgate.py, CEO §106), whatever key
signs it. The Android suite's throwaway-key bundle (native-android-app.test.sh) proves the signing path
and needs a pass, so it writes this fixture into its own scratch and names it with
RICHOS_SHIP_GATE_VERDICTS. The gate judges the fixture by every rule it applies to the speed watch's own
verdicts (a "good" verdict, a record on disk for committed code with the same app code, cold and warm
under the current §104 limits), and its pass line says the verdicts were a stand-in.

  ship_gate_fixture.py --dir DIR --platform android|ios --commit SHA [--walks WALKS]

Writes DIR/measured.json and DIR/<platform>.json and prints DIR. DIR is the caller's scratch, never the
speed watch's state directory.

The bundle also needs a PASSING review walk of its commit (CEO §107, richos/mobile/perf/reviewwalk.py).
With --walks, a STAND-IN passing walk record for SHA is written into WALKS, the caller's scratch named by
RICHOS_REVIEW_WALK_RECORDS (never the walks' own state directory); `randroid bundle` judges it by every
rule of a real record and its pass line says the walk records were a stand-in.
