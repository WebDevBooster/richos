"""ios_ui_shards.py — the split and the proof for native-ios-ui.test.sh's sharded simulator run.

    ios_ui_shards.py split <work> <shards> <times.tsv> <-only-testing selectors...>
        <work>/tests.json (xcodebuild -enumerate-tests, flat JSON) -> <work>/shard-N.args, one
        `-only-testing:<id>` per line, and <work>/expected.txt, the whole list. Balanced by the
        seconds each test cost last time (<times.tsv>), longest first; by count when unknown.
        With one shard, the selectors pass through unchanged and nothing is enumerated.
    ios_ui_shards.py verify <work> <shards> <times.tsv> <device>...
        For every device (shards consecutive in <work>/result-<i>.xcresult): every shard exited
        0, and the tests the bundles report are EXACTLY the listed tests. Prints the counts and
        each skip with its reason; records per-test seconds in <times.tsv>. Exit 1 on any gap.
    ios_ui_shards.py name-shots <exported-dir> <out-dir>
        Renames exported attachments after their screen, as the unsplit suite always did.
    ios_ui_shards.py selftest
        The split and the proof against fixtures, no simulator (native-ios-ui --headless runs it).

WHY THE PROOF IS BY NAME. Splitting a list is where a test goes missing without anything going
red: a selector that matched nothing, a shard that died before its bundle was written, an
identifier spelled one way by the enumeration and another by the result bundle. So the proof is
not "every shard exited 0" — it is "the set of tests that ran equals the set that exists".
