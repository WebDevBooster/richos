"""Refuse SOURCE that bakes a build-machine path into the shipped program.

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT `no_host_paths.py`. That one inspects the built
bundle and is the guarantee; this one reads the source and is the early warning. They
catch the same class of defect at two different costs. On 2026-09-18 the nightly build
of `e6f62448` compiled for the better part of an hour, bundled, and only then refused:

    no-host-paths: ... RichOS.app carries 1 home-directory prefix(es) across 1 file(s)
      /Users/alex   (1 occurrence(s))

The one occurrence was
`/Users/alex/.richos-nightly/source/richos/app/src-tauri`, and it came from a single line
of Rust:

    let from_source = std::path::Path::new(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")).join("../phone");

`--remap-path-prefix` could not touch it. The flag rewrites the COMPILER's path metadata;
`env!` produces a string literal, which is program data. So the artifact check was the
only thing that could see it, and it saw it at the end of an hour.

This check sees it in under a second, on the source, before anything is compiled. It does
not replace the artifact check and must never be read as doing so: a vendored C library
baking in `__FILE__`, a new dependency shape or a future toolchain would put host paths
back with nothing here to notice. The artifact is still the guarantee.

WHAT IS A FINDING

  1. `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")` outside test code. There is no correct use in a shipped
     path: it is the directory the crate was compiled in, on the machine that compiled it.
  2. A string literal containing `/Users/<name>/` outside test code — a hand-written home
     directory, which is the same disclosure by hand.
  3. `env!("OUT_DIR")` that is NOT the argument of `include!`, `include_bytes!` or
     `include_str!`. Those three consume the path at compile time and put only the
     INCLUDED BYTES in the program, which is how the phone app is embedded
     (`src/phone/assets.rs`). Used as a value, `OUT_DIR` is the same leak as (1) wearing a
     different name, so the allowance is exactly as wide as the thing that needs it.

WHAT IS NOT A FINDING, AND WHY EACH EXEMPTION IS NARROW

  * TEST CODE. Anything inside a `#[cfg(test)]` module or function is skipped: it is
    compiled out of the shipped program by the same compiler. `ca.rs`'s word-list test
    reads the phone app's own file through `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` and is right to.
  * COMMENTS AND DOC COMMENTS. They do not reach the binary. `activation.rs` documents a
    measurement it took at `/Users/alex/Applications/RichOS.app/...`, which is evidence and
    stays.
  * PLACEHOLDER HOMES: `/Users/you/`, `/Users/example/`. Named for the same reason
    `no_host_paths.py` names them — they are invented fixture paths the product ships
    deliberately, they name no machine, and a check that refuses them is a check people
    learn to override.

Usage:
    no_compile_time_paths.py [ROOT ...] [--allow-home NAME]... [--quiet]
    no_compile_time_paths.py --self-test

Exit: 0 clean, 1 findings, 2 bad usage.
