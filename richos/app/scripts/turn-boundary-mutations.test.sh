# CEO ruling §88: work he gives typed, aloud or from the phone starts the same way. Every entrance
# that runs his turns adopts at its boundary, and scripts/turn-boundary-mutations.py takes each
# door away in turn and requires a named test to go red. That full run needs cargo per mutant and
# is run by hand under reserve.py; this suite proves the cheap half on every change to the files
# the mutants live in: each mutant still applies exactly once and names tests that exist. A
# mutant whose site has moved proves nothing, and this is where that is noticed.
