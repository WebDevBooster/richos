# qa.test.sh — the acceptance suite for the walk toolkit in scripts/qa/.
#
# WHY IT IS HERE AND NOT AT scripts/qa/qa.test.sh
# ===============================================
# `run-tests.sh` builds its inventory with `find -maxdepth 1`. A suite one
# directory down runs in no build and appears in no `--only` list — which is
# how `scripts/testvm/test/run-tests.sh` came to be invisible, recorded in
# `proof-for.sh`'s own comment. A toolkit whose tests never run is a toolkit
# whose next user rewrites it, so the suite sits where the harness looks and
# the tools sit next to each other.
#
# WHAT IT PROVES, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT
# =================================================
# Every case runs against committed fixtures in seconds. Nothing here boots a
# VM, opens a window, photographs a screen or presses a key: the two tools
# that CAN do those things are proved by driving them into their refusal.
#
# The refusals are the point of half of this file. Each tool replaces a
# scratch script that reported success in a state where it had measured
# nothing — a wait that timed out and exited 0, a gate whose reader was blind,
# a redactor that never re-read its output, a contrast estimator that took a
# single antialiasing pixel as the ink. Those are the cases with the long
# names.
#
# Cases:
#   H1-H9   every tool answers --help and exits 0
#   C1-C9   contrast: the arithmetic, the spellings, the thresholds, refusals
#   P1-P3   the PNG layer: the no-Pillow decoder agrees with Pillow, round trip
#   F1-F6   frame: pixels, extent, inset, motion, and mismatched sizes refused
#   O1-O6   the OCR gate and the finder, including a blind reader and an
#           empty frame set
#   R1-R4   redact: it covers the address, it keeps the evidence, it re-reads
#   W1-W8   wait-for: it succeeds, and it FAILS on timeout
#   T1-T6   timeline: first change, no change, no baseline, stats, refusals
#   N1-N5   phone-client: a foreign Mac that refuses the credential is the
#           answer, one that ACCEPTS it exits non-zero; argument refusals
#   K1-K5   flake-rate: counts, interleaving, a kept failing log, refusals
#   R5-R8   redact --phones: the gate flags a phone-shaped fixture, the redactor
#           covers it, the gate then passes the output, the evidence survives
#   R9-R12  redact --homes: the same four for a /Users/<name> home path
#   A1-A19  phone-android: taps by the words on screen, refuses an unnamed or
#           unattached phone, times out as a failure, reads a closure state and
#           an idle-frame rhythm, types through a key map, reads the editable
#           field, runs one closure cell, finds unnamed controls, all against a
#           scripted adb (no phone); A22-A23 refuses unless randroid device started
#           it, and refuses a phone holding a debuggable RichConnect
#   L1-L4   lab-ledger: exactly once passes; missing, duplicated or altered
#           fails; a timeline without the isolated lab's owner marker is refused
#   LP1-LP4 lab-pause: the lab's listener is held stopped between two marks and
#           continued; a lab without the owner marker and a pid that is not the
#           listener are refused; a missing mark times out and still continues
#   SM1-SM2 step-mark: one timestamped line appended to a step log; no words refused
#   HS1-HS3 hidden-send-try: tap Send, Home, Wi-Fi off, release, Wi-Fi on in order
#           against a scripted adb; Wi-Fi put back on when the switch failed half
#           way; a malformed Send position refused; HS6-HS7 a debuggable build or a
#           start outside randroid device refused before the first mark
#   TR1-TR4 tunnel-requests: the lab tunnel's request counter sampled from a scripted
#           helper and counted between two instants (two rises); an unreadable
#           reading in the window, a window the readings miss and a port without
#           the counter are each refused
#   I0      phone-ios: a command that touches the phone refuses unless rios device ran it
#   I1-I16  phone-ios: a step list validated before any build, refusals, the
#           per-step log read once each, no picture of the person's account,
#           a reused build trusted only against its stamp, no lock without a
#           person to open it, a bounded log capture kept on the SSD; I35-I36 a
#           list the XCUITest allowance cannot hold is refused before the phone
#           is touched (later shots would be lost); I37 a reused build is the
#           products its stamp names (a shared-store entry included); I17-I18
#           pair-steps for pairing v2 waits for each word and holds before the press;
#           I19-I23 appearance and orientation steps, summary of a finished run;
#           I24-I26 the phone runner's step dispatcher (PhysicalDeviceTests.perform)
#           knows every step the host validates, a drifted runner FAILS; I27-I28
#           syslog-rate counts one process's log entries per bucket, refuses a non-log;
#           I31-I32 Settings and Safari places and an https-only open step; I33-I34
#           another app launched fresh, a switch by kind and label, SpringBoard never closed
#   FC1-FC4 phone-ios forecast: prompt-free runs, other id, unknown, run ledger
#   J1-J7   phone-ios approval: the UI-automation approval forecast from the phone's
#           own sessions, and a run expected to ask refused until the CEO was told
#   V1-V10  pair-words: the phone corpus's own v2 words, the origin written as a
#           browser writes it, the lab's words from its own files, a mismatch
#           that FAILS, a half-read phone log, a non-lab directory, a v1 phone
#           and a lab no phone has reached, each refused
#   US1-US4 usage-shape: a get_usage answer RichOS's reader gets no figures from (rate_limits
#           null) exits 1 naming the rule; a readable one exits 0; no binary and a
#           claude that never answers are refused, against a scripted claude
#   X1      the committed fixtures still match their generator
#
