#
# =========================================================================================
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# =========================================================================================
#
# The CEO, 2026-09-17 (ruling §48): he tests brand-new nightly versions in their own
# folders "so that I can finally stop using this terminal here and start using the app".
# The §48 addenda fix the folders: `~/myrichos-nightly-a` is a newborn, `~/myrichos-nightly-b`
# has the roster page imported as memory, and his daily driver stays on his real HOME with
# `~/myrichos` as its folder. Nothing this script does may reach the daily driver.
#
# Adoption ledger §2.5 "Developer loop" (ADOPT AS-IS): a state directory derived per install,
# so a test install never shares data with the real app. Here the "state directory" is the
# folder's own HOME, and it makes sense for RichOS because a nightly under test must never
# write into his daily driver's memory or settings (§48).
#
# =========================================================================================
# WHAT THE APP IS STARTED WITH, AND WHY EACH LINE IS THERE
# =========================================================================================
#
#   HOME=<folder>/home               the app's data, engine, updater and memory pointer all
#                                    derive from HOME, so the folder owns all of them.
#   CFFIXED_USER_HOME=<folder>/home  HOME alone is NOT enough, and this was measured
#                                    (2026-09-24, this Mac, JXA through osascript):
#                                    with HOME pointed elsewhere, Foundation's
#                                    NSHomeDirectory() still answered /Users/<him>, so
#                                    WebKit's store, preferences and caches would land in
#                                    his REAL ~/Library under the same bundle identifier his
#                                    daily driver uses. With CFFIXED_USER_HOME set as well
#                                    it answered the fake home. Both are set.
#   RICHOS_ACTIVATION=regular        a nightly under a folder HOME fails activation fact D,
#                                    so without this it would boot as an invisible
#                                    accessory (README.md, "Booting the app in a test").
#   DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1            `claude` updates itself into $HOME/.local; under the
#                                    folder HOME that would install a second copy of it
#                                    inside the folder and retarget the link below. The
#                                    link already follows his own `claude` as it updates.
#   LORO_CORPUS= LORO_ROOT=          explicit and exclusive in the app (loro.rs, "resolve
#                                    corpus"): a stray value would point the nightly at a
#                                    memory that is not the folder's. Empty is unset there.
#   RICHOS_ENGINE_DIR= and
#   RICHOS_ENGINE_ROOT=              EMPTY, never set to anything. A pinned nightly boots
#                                    only the engine installed from its own asset, and an
#                                    explicit statement outranks the pin (setup.rs,
#                                    `engine_boot_refusal`), so setting one would put the
#                                    moving engine back. Empty is unset there too.
#   RICHOS_CLAUDE_BIN=               explicit and exclusive (setup.rs `find_claude`); the
#                                    folder's own link below is what the app should find.
#
# The launch goes through LaunchServices (`open -n -a`), so the app is launchd's child
# exactly as a double-clicked app is, and the terminal can be closed afterwards. A launch
# through LaunchServices does not carry this shell's environment, which is why every
# value above is stated rather than inherited, and why CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR is refused
# rather than cleared: `claude` treats an empty value as a path.
#
# THE SIGN-IN. Under a folder HOME `claude` answers "Not logged in" unless three things
# of his are reachable from it (richos docs/verification/first-words-on-the-window-
# 2026-09-19.md §7, three probes in order): `~/.claude` linked, `~/.claude.json` copied,
# and `~/Library/Keychains` linked. All three are made here, plus `~/.local/bin/claude`
# linked, because that is the one place a double-clicked app looks for `claude`
# (setup.rs `find_claude`: $RICHOS_CLAUDE_BIN, then $HOME/.local/bin/claude, then PATH,
# and launchd's PATH has no `claude` on it). The cost is stated plainly: `~/.claude` is
# his whole Claude configuration and history, shared with the terminal by design.
#
# =========================================================================================
# WHAT IT REFUSES
# =========================================================================================
#
#   * a ZIP that is missing, is not a zip, or does not hold exactly one RichOS.app;
#   * a folder holding another version (another ZIP, by digest) unless --replace, and a
#     folder holding anything this script did not record, always;
#   * ANY path under ~/myrichos — the folder, its home, the ZIP, the roster page — after
#     following symlinks. ~/myrichos-nightly-a is a sibling of ~/myrichos, not inside it,
#     so this is a path-component test and never a string prefix;
#   * a second start of a folder whose nightly is already running (two writers, one data);
#   * CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR set anywhere the app would inherit it;
#   * a missing piece of the sign-in, named, rather than a window that says "Not logged in".
#
# THE ONE WAY TO DEFEAT IT, stated so nobody has to find it: opening
# `~/myrichos-nightly-*/RichOS.app` from Finder, Spotlight or the Dock starts it on your
# REAL HOME, against your daily driver's data. This script cannot prevent that; it can
# only be the one way you start a nightly. `status` says what each folder holds.
#
# THE WAY OUT: quit the nightly as you quit any app. To start a folder over as a newborn,
# quit it and move the whole folder to the Trash; nothing outside it refers to it.
#
# TEST SEAMS (the suite beside this file; never needed in use):
#   RICHOS_NIGHTLY_TEST_REAL_HOME   stands in for your account's home
#   RICHOS_NIGHTLY_OPEN / _PS / _LAUNCHCTL   stand in for /usr/bin/open, /bin/ps, /bin/launchctl
#   RICHOS_NIGHTLY_WAIT_SECONDS     how long to wait for the started app's pid (default 30)
