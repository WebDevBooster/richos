# work-walk.test.sh — the work path's crash-matrix host, proved without a VM, a model or a network.
#
#   scripts/work-walk.test.sh
#
# The host (crates/richos-core/examples/work_walk.rs) is what W4 runs in the test VM in place of
# the app's window (richos-hq docs/plans/2026-09-27-work-path-answer-delivery-design.md §4.2): the
# real WorkHost on the production work lease, the durable question store and inbox, boot recovery
# and the question worker's pass. What can be proved without a guest is proved here: it builds as
# the product would (every crash point empty) and as the matrix builds it (crash-points), it
# serves the back end's question tool exactly as the app does, and it refuses to host without an
# engine, writing nothing. W4's grading is proved by operator-probes/test/run-tests.sh.
