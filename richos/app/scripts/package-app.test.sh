#
# package-app.test.sh — the signing configuration and the bundle verification,
# exercised as far as they can be without a Developer ID certificate.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE CAN AND CANNOT PROVE, stated first because the distinction is
# the whole reason it exists.
#
#   IT PROVES     every refusal, by running it; the identity DISCOVERY rule on 0,
#                 1 and 2 identities; that discovery never self-selects the
#                 developer-id path; the notary credential rules including the
#                 in-repo and world-readable refusals; and every branch of
#                 verify_bundle's developer-id arm, fired against a REAL signed
#                 bundle.
#
#   IT CANNOT     prove that a Developer ID signature works. No certificate exists
#                 on any machine here (`security find-identity -v -p codesigning`
#                 reports 0), so nothing has ever been signed with one, notarized
#                 or stapled. Sections B and C therefore run against a `security`
#                 SHIM that reports synthetic identities. That shim proves what the
#                 SCRIPT does with an inventory; it proves nothing about codesign.
#                 Where the shim is used, the case name says so.
#
# THE FIXTURE BUNDLE IS REAL, and this is the part that surprised the author.
# package-app.sh cannot build anything on this tree at all: the icon gate refuses
# on the placeholder icon set (CEO item 2.6, the artwork, still open), so there was
# no bundle to verify against. But verify_bundle takes a PATH — it does not care
# who produced it. So section D builds a minimal .app by hand, ad-hoc signs it with
# the real codesign, and points the real --verify-only at it. Every developer-id
# check then fires against a genuine signature that is genuinely not a Developer ID
# one, which is exactly the negative half, and the mutations in D3-D7 turn the
# positive half red one reason at a time.
#
# Cases:
#   A1  an unknown argument is refused, never ignored
#   A2  --sign with a value that is neither mode is refused
#   A3  --help prints the usage, including the notarize and dry-run forms
#   B1  developer-id with NO Developer ID identity refuses, and names the two scripts [shim]
#   B2  developer-id with RICHOS_SIGNING_IDENTITY the machine does not report refuses
#   B3  developer-id with exactly ONE identity DISCOVERS it   [shim]
#   B4  developer-id with TWO refuses and lists both rather than sorting  [shim]
#   B5  a plain (ad-hoc) run with an identity present does NOT use it     [shim]
#   C1  RICHOS_NOTARIZE=1 with no credentials refuses                     [shim]
#   C2  a half-supplied API key refuses and names the missing parts       [shim]
#   C3  a key path that does not exist refuses                            [shim]
#   C4  a key INSIDE a git worktree refuses                               [shim]
#   C5  a world-readable key refuses                                      [shim]
#   C6  a complete key, outside a repo, mode 600, resolves                 [shim]
#   C7  RICHOS_NOTARY_PROFILE alone resolves                              [shim]
#   C8  APPLE_ID + APPLE_PASSWORD + APPLE_TEAM_ID are NOT accepted        [shim]
#   D1  a real ad-hoc bundle passes --verify-only in adhoc mode
#   D2  ...and FAILS in developer-id mode on all EIGHT developer-id grounds —
#       authority, hardened runtime, timestamp, entitlement, and the four separate
#       clauses of the designated requirement
#   D3  a missing shipped icon fails
#   D4  a shipped icon that is not this repository's fails
#   D5  a missing NSMicrophoneUsageDescription fails
#   D6  a bundle whose signature was removed fails
#   D7  --expect-notarized fires the stapled-ticket check
#   D8  a bundle with no CFBundleShortVersionString fails — it cannot say which version
#       it is, and the settings menu would render "RichOS " with nothing after it
#   D9  a bundle whose version is not the one this build intended fails
#   D10 a version with no release behind it SAYS SO, declared --release, at the build
#   D11 ...and the one caller that overrides the version on purpose is not refused
#   D12 ...and the other branch: a version that IS a release says so, and names the commit
#   D13 a correct bundle is owner-writable THROUGHOUT and still verifies — the measurement
#       that disqualifies spec point 17's own wording, kept as a case so it is not re-argued
#   D14 a group-writable path inside Contents/ fails
#   D15 a world-writable directory inside Contents/ fails
#   D16 a shipped .jsonl fails — state in the bundle, caught at build time
#   D17 a shipped config.json fails
#   F1  a bare, undeclared version is refused unless --release says this bundle is one
#   F2  ...and --release accepts the identical bare version
#   F3  a nightly-suffixed version needs no declared intent — it was never "bare"
#   F4  --nightly on that same version resolves
#   F5  --nightly does NOT excuse a bare version — only --release does
#   F6  --release and --nightly cannot both be declared
#   F7  --nightly with no value is refused
#   F8  a plain run with no declared intent is a development build, stamped {version}-dev.{commit}
#   F9  --release keeps the bare Cargo.toml version, unstamped
#   F10 --nightly refuses when Cargo.toml disagrees with the declared version
#   F11 --nightly with the version Cargo.toml already carries resolves
#   F12 a clean fixture tree's development stamp carries no .dirty suffix
#   F13 an uncommitted change appends .dirty to the development stamp
#   F14 a -dev. bundle is accepted with no declared intent, and says so
#   E1  an exported API key does not satisfy the no-credentials case       [shim]
#   E2  exported halves do not complete a half-supplied key                [shim]
#   E3  an exported key does not outrank the case's own profile            [shim]

# EVERY CASE RUNS WITH THE OPERATOR'S OWN SIGNING VARIABLES REMOVED, and that is
# not tidiness. On 2026-09-16 this suite was the single red gate of the first
# nightly release attempt: C1, C2, C7 and C8 failed on the CEO's Mac and on no
# other machine, because nightly-local.py exported his real App Store Connect API
# key into every gate. "No credentials" then had a complete key; "half a key" got
# its missing halves from the environment; the profile case lost to the key that
# package-app.sh prefers. The refusals were right. Their environment was not.
#
# A verdict that depends on what the operator happens to have exported is the
# failure this repository keeps paying for in both directions: green over a check
# that never ran, red over a defect that never happened. So the suite states its
# own environment instead of inheriting one.
