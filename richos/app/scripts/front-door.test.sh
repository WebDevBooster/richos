# front-door.test.sh — drive the SHIPPED window's front door through AppKit, not through an
# automation protocol, and hold the one row `ui/tests` structurally cannot reach.
#
# =========================================================================================
# WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A CHECK IN `ui/tests`
# =========================================================================================
#
# `ui/tests/escape.js` has ten checks and thirty-nine assertions about the CEO's rule — "the
# user must always be able to close any popup of any kind by simply tapping the escape key"
# (2026-09-17, item 1) — and every one of them is green. Ray then walked the candidate-.9
# bundle and reported the settings menu surviving Escape
# (`docs/verification/2026-09-18-nightly-1.2.0-nightly.20260918.3-onscreen-audit.md` §4).
#
# The two are not in contradiction, because they are not measuring the same thing.
# `page.keyboard.press("Escape")` hands a synthesized event to the page through WebKit's
# automation protocol. The shipped window has no such path: a key travels
#
#     the keyboard (or a CGEvent)  ->  the window server  ->  NSApplication
#       ->  the key window  ->  the WKWebView as first responder  ->  the web content
#       ->  `document`'s keydown listeners
#
# and every arrow in that chain is a place the press can be lost, all of them below the layer
# `escape.js` starts at. Three suites' worth of green says the HANDLER is right; it can never
# say the key arrives. This is the only file in this repository that can.
#
# =========================================================================================
# WHAT READING THE NATIVE TREE WILL AND WILL NOT TELL YOU — measured, 2026-09-18
# =========================================================================================
#
# **System Events reports nodes for subtrees that are `display: none` in the renderer.** This
# is not a suspicion; it was measured both ways on the same build in the same hour.
#
# In the .9 window's own tree, at rest, with nothing open:
#
#     AXGroup | name=Connected repositories
#     AXGroup | name=Allow this action?
#     AXGroup | name=Quit while work is running?
#
# and in the real renderer under WebKit, at the same point in the same page:
#
#     #repositories-sheet  -> { hiddenAttr: true, display: "none" }
#     #permission-sheet    -> { hiddenAttr: true, display: "none" }
#     #quit-question       -> { hiddenAttr: true, display: "none" }
#
# (`[hidden] { display: none !important }`, `style.css:280`, which the app sets precisely
# because several of these declare their own `display`.)
#
# SO A NODE'S PRESENCE IN THAT TREE IS NOT EVIDENCE THAT IT IS ON SCREEN, and a check that
# asserts on presence will report a closed sheet as open. Ray's row 2 rested partly on "the
# tree still returns the sheet's 5 nodes"; that half of it is void, and his screenshots are
# what the row actually stands on. Every assertion below is on the node's SIZE.
#
# AND THE SIZE IS NOT 0x0 — the first draft of this file said it was, and it is not. Measured
# on the .9 window at 16:27:45Z, all three of those closed sheets report `260,130 1400x10`:
# the WEB AREA's own origin and a degenerate full-width 10pt strip. A rule that rejected only
# a zero box would have called every closed sheet in this app open, so the strip is calibrated
# from a known-closed sheet on each run (C5) and rejected by value.
#
# =========================================================================================
# THE PRECONDITIONS, DECLARED, BECAUSE THIS CHECK IS WORTHLESS WITHOUT THEM
# =========================================================================================
#
# P1  AT LEAST ONE ACTIVE DISPLAY. `gui_display_counts` in `lib/gui-launch.sh` carries the
#     whole diagnosis: macOS ACTIVE means connected, AWAKE and available for drawing, so a
#     Mac whose screens have gone to sleep reports every display ONLINE and NO display
#     ACTIVE, and the app truthfully prints `window: the runtime reported no attached
#     display`. Measured here on 2026-09-18: with the screens asleep this suite's own boot
#     produced exactly that line and `count of windows` 0.
#
# P2  THE SESSION MUST NOT BE LOCKED. This one cost a full measurement before it was found.
#     With `CGSSessionScreenIsLocked = true` the app boots, derives a real geometry on a real
#     monitor — `window: derived 1400x880 pt at (260,102) ... Monitor #30942` — and yet
#     System Events reports `windows: 0` and cannot answer "which process is frontmost" at
#     all. Synthesized keys go nowhere. A run in that state can only produce a false red on
#     every check below.
#
#         $ ioreg -n Root -d1 -a | grep -A1 CGSSessionScreenIsLocked
#         	<key>CGSSessionScreenIsLocked</key>
#         	<true/>
#
#     CEO ruling 2026-09-18 (§56) is that screen-bound work WAITS for the unlock as a state —
#     it never fails and it never nags. `--wait-for-screen <seconds>` is that wait. Without
#     it, an unmet precondition is a NAMED REFUSAL and exit 2: not a pass, not a failure of
#     the product, and never silence.
#
# P3  `cliclick`. The keys have to come from somewhere outside the app.
#
# P4  THE SCRATCH HOME MUST BE CANONICAL, AND THIS ONE IS NOT ABOUT THE MACHINE — IT IS
#     ABOUT WHAT THIS FILE PUTS ON THE PERSON'S SCREEN. This harness asks for
#     `RICHOS_ACTIVATION=regular`, which `activation.rs:72` grants and which
#     `startup_alert.rs:110-112` uses as the EXACT condition for arming the modal alert. So
#     this is the one harness in the repository that can show "RichOS could not open" to the
#     person at the Mac, and on 2026-09-18 at 16:11:56Z it did, for two minutes, because the
#     scratch HOME was built under `$TMPDIR` and `/var` is a symlink to `private/var`:
#
#         failure: application startup: Could not establish application update exclusion:
#                  home is not a canonical directory
#
#     `richos-user-update::root` (lib.rs:147) refuses a HOME that is not already its own
#     `canonicalize()`. `pwd -P` at creation makes it canonical; P4 then re-asks the same
#     question before the launch, so a future `$TMPDIR` this harness did not anticipate is a
#     named refusal with nothing on screen, rather than a dialog he has to dismiss.
#
#     THE FIRST ACCOUNT OF THIS FAILURE BLAMED THE DOUBLED SLASH IN `${TMPDIR}/...`, AND IT
#     IS WRONG — measured on rustc 1.98.0: `Path::new("/a//b") == Path::new("/a/b")` is
#     TRUE, `/private/var/…/T//x//home` canonicalizes EQUAL, and `/var/…/T/x/home` with no
#     doubled slash anywhere canonicalizes UNEQUAL. Trimming the slash alone would have
#     fixed nothing.
#
# And if a boot fails anyway, for a reason none of the four preconditions can see, the boot
# watch below ends the instance at the stderr line — which `cannot_start` writes BEFORE it
# raises the alert — rather than letting a ten-minute modal stand for the length of the run.
#
# =========================================================================================
# A BUILD HOST HAS NO BUNDLE, AND THAT IS A GAP — NOT A USAGE ERROR (exit 2, not 64)
# =========================================================================================
#
# `run-tests.sh` discovers this file from disk and runs it WITH NO ARGUMENTS, because that is
# the only way an inventory can be honest (see its header: there is no second place to edit,
# so a suite dropped beside it runs). A build host therefore invokes this suite with no
# bundle at all — and until 2026-09-18 that produced exit 64 from the argument check below,
# which the runner reads as a FAILED SUITE. It stopped the nightly build of candidate .10
# (run log `~/.richos-nightly/logs/20260918T171138Z-c26afbc2.log:2571`), and the thing it
# reported was not a defect in the product or in this file: there was simply no app to drive.
#
# The two states are different and now exit differently:
#
#   NO BUNDLE WAS NAMED          -> exit 2, "this host cannot answer". A fact about THIS
#     (neither --bundle nor         INVOCATION, not a verdict about the code. Nothing is
#      --release)                   launched, no key is synthesized, the screen is untouched.
#                                   `run-tests.sh` tolerates it only under a caller's
#                                   declaration by name WITH a reason, and goes red the day
#                                   this suite starts answering there instead.
#
#   A BUNDLE WAS NAMED AND IS    -> exit 64, unchanged. Somebody pointed this suite at a
#     NOT A RichOS.app              thing and the thing is wrong; that is an answer about
#     (or a --release with no       the argument, and no declaration may tolerate it.
#      RichOS.app.tar.gz)
#
# THE GAP IS DELIBERATELY DECIDED FIRST, ahead of P1-P4. On a build host the true and only
# interesting fact is "no bundle was named"; refusing over an asleep screen or a missing
# `cliclick` first would report the second-most-relevant thing and make the repair look like
# a machine to fix rather than a run to make by hand.
#
# AND THE HONEST LIMIT, because `run-tests.sh`'s header names it: a gap over a suite with no
# host-independent cases is a gap over silence. Every case in this file needs a window, so
# under a declaration this suite contributes NOTHING to a build. It is not a build-time check
# and never was — it is run by hand, or from a walk, against a published release.
#
# =========================================================================================
# CASES
# =========================================================================================
#
#   P0  a bundle was named at all    -> otherwise THIS HOST CANNOT ANSWER, exit 2, and
#                                        nothing is launched, sent or put on the screen
#   P1  a display is awake            -> otherwise a named refusal, exit 2
#   P2  the session is unlocked       -> otherwise a named refusal, exit 2  (or wait for it)
#   P3  cliclick is on this machine   -> otherwise a named refusal, exit 2
#   P4  the scratch HOME is canonical -> otherwise a named refusal, exit 2, NOTHING LAUNCHED
#   P5  the boot reached its window   -> otherwise the instance is ENDED AT ONCE and named,
#                                        exit 2, so no modal alert stands on his screen
#   C0  the bundle boots and puts exactly one window on screen
#   C1  POSITIVE CONTROL — a native keystroke reaches the web content at all
#   C2  POSITIVE CONTROL — the same DOCUMENT-level keydown listener that owns Escape runs on
#       a native key (Cmd-K opens the search overlay; it is three lines above the Escape arm
#       in the same listener in `main.js`)
#   C3  Escape closes the search overlay
#   C4  Escape closes the settings menu — audit-9 row 2, the row this file exists for
#   C5b the word `Enter` is a promise — Return, on the SYSTEM EVENTS path, opens the door
#       (audit-10 row 2; Ray's own measurement went through `cliclick`, which he then proved
#       does not deliver special keys to this app, and he asked for exactly this re-run)
#   C5  the tree is read by SIZE and the calibration above is re-proved on this run: a sheet
#       that is `display:none` is present and 0x0
#   Z   this run left nothing running, and the pid is named
#
# The app is QUIT through its own menu and the pid is proved gone (CEO §54 addendum 4): "Test

# C5b — THE WORD `Enter` IS A PROMISE. DOES THE KEY KEEP IT, ON A REAL WINDOW? — audit-10 row 2
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Ray, candidate .10 §4: "With the window frontmost I pressed Return on the opening screen at
# 18:51:32. Nothing. The word `Enter` is clickable with a mouse — I clicked it at 18:51:43 and
# it let me in — and that is the only way it works." And then, to his credit, the caveat:
# "that Return went through `cliclick`, which I later proved unreliable for this app ... the
# keyboard half of it deserves a re-run on the System Events path."
#
# IT DOES, AND THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE IN THIS REPOSITORY THAT CAN GIVE IT ONE. `ui/tests`
# holds the handler green — `home.js`'s check "the word 'Enter' is a promise the key keeps,
# from anywhere on the screen" asserts it and passes — and that suite hands keys to the page
# through WebKit's automation protocol, a path the shipped window does not have. Three suites'
# worth of green says the HANDLER is right and can never say the key ARRIVES. That is this
# file's whole thesis, applied to a second row.
#
# IT COSTS THE RUN NOTHING, which is why it goes here rather than in a case of its own. The
# harness has to leave the opening screen anyway, and it has always done that with a CLICK
# precisely because key delivery was still in doubt. So: press Return first, look, and fall
# back to the click. A run in which the key works reports it; a run in which it does not still
# reaches every case below.
#
# C1 IS WHAT KEEPS THIS HONEST IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. If the System Events path itself stops
# arriving, C1 goes red and this verdict is void rather than wrong — the same relationship C4
# already has with C3.
# THE DOOR IS IDENTIFIED BY ITS BOX, NOT BY ITS NAME, AND THE FIRST DRAFT OF THIS CASE PROVED
# WHY. Run against the .5 bundle on 2026-09-18 it reported "the door is still on screen at
# 40x40" — and the door is 174x52 (this file's own `size_of` example measures it). 40x40 is the
# DESK's own `Settings` box, so a SECOND node carrying this name exists once the home screen
# has gone, and a name-only test reads the door as still up on a run where it opened. The home
# screen's door has one box, taken from `0-rest`; anything else by that name is another control.
#
# AND IT SPENDS ONE TREE DUMP, NOT THREE, WHICH IS ALSO MEASURED RATHER THAN TIDINESS. The
# first draft took its own before-dump and its own fallback-dump, added about six seconds
# before `drain_first_run`, and the first-run company question then surfaced DURING C1 — so C1
# went red on the .5 bundle in both runs of that draft while the pristine file was 7-for-7 on
# the same bundle in the same hour. A case that costs the run a positive control is a case that
# has broken the suite to ask its question. `0-rest` is already taken above and `0c` serves both
# the verdict and the fallback.
