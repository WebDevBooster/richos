# WAITING FOR CARGO'S LOCK IS QUEUEING, NEVER CLIPPY'S WORK (audit R12,
# docs/verification/2026-09-29-load-sensitive-checks-audit.md). Cargo prints this line on
# stderr when another cargo holds the build-directory or package-cache lock, and nothing
# more until it has the lock. Until 2026-09-29 the Tauri cap counted that wait, so a cold
# Clippy queued behind another build could spend its 180 s before it started. The wait is
# now measured and reported, and bounded only by this hang guard: the same 1800 s the
# machine worker admission gives a queued command (worker_tokens.py).
