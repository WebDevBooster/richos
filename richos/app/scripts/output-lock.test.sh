# output-lock.test.sh — two packaging runs never write one output directory at once.
#
# Hunt part 2, section 21. Every developer checkout's `app/target` and `src-tauri/target` is
# a symlink into one shared cache (shared-build-cache.sh), so two checkouts packaging at the
# same moment named the same engine tarball, pin file and Tauri bundle. Cargo's lock covers
# the compile only; the packaging after it is shell. `lib/output-lock.sh` is the lock those
# steps now hold, and these cases are the ways it could fail to be one.
#
# Cases:
#   O1  a second hold on a held directory waits, and refuses past RICHOS_OUTPUT_LOCK_WAIT
#   O2  the same directory reached through a symlink (another checkout's shape) is one lock
#   O3  the lock is released when its holder exits, and the next run takes it
#   O4  a child of the holder is not blocked by its own caller's lock
#   O5  two different directories do not block each other
#   O6  make-engine-asset.sh writes nothing into an output directory another run holds
#   O7  ...and builds normally once that run is gone
#   O8  package-app.sh goes no further while another run holds its bundle output
#   O9  a caller holding the bundle output (make-release.sh app) does not block its own
#       package-app.sh
