"""autocheck.py — the basic checks run by git itself, at commit and at merge, for everyone.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-29, CEO ruling §97). Nightly attempt 20260929T063824Z-b27b6279
failed on `lint growth: clippy::let_underscore_must_use: 782 > 777`: a branch added five
discarded send results, nobody ran the lint before it reached main, and the build found it.
His words: *"WHY THE FUCK DOES ANYONE NEED TO BE "TOLD" ANYTHING WHEN IT COMES TO PREVENTING
BASIC-LEVEL SHIT-FUCKERY OF ANY KIND????"* So nobody is told. Git runs this through the
repository's hooks (installed by `install.sh` beside this file) for every committer: an
engineer in a worktree, Codex, Rich in the main checkout.

  COMMIT, on any branch but main (pre-commit): `lint.sh --changed --strict` over what
  differs from HEAD, i.e. the lint ratchets (static, load rules, and Clippy for a Rust set
  whose inputs changed), and no count may grow whatever room a ceiling has. Then the land's
  own selector (`proof-for.sh`) over the BRANCH'S WHOLE CHANGE: whatever it refuses
  (UNCOVERED, a map that does not reconcile) refuses the commit, and the selected suites that
  measure under a second run here (see branch_selection). A merge into a branch
  (pre-merge-commit) runs `--changed` against the ceilings only. Both run on exactly the
  content being committed: unstaged edits and untracked files are set aside for the length
  of the check and put back after it (StagedOnly). The repository enforces no formatter, so
  none is run. A failure refuses the commit with the reason.

  LAND, anything that moves main (pre-merge-commit on main, pre-commit on main, and
  pre-push of main as the backstop): the suites that own the changed files
  (`proof-for.sh --gate`), run by `proof-run.py`, plus `lint.sh --changed` when the land
  changes something under richos/app and the selection does not already include
  `lint.test.sh` (the push backstop: `--all`). Every check is stopped at 600 s, and the gate
  runs in rounds of at most 900 s that keep every pass, at most six (THE MERGE GATE'S LIMITS,
  A LARGE LAND RUNS IN ROUNDS). Nobody chooses the suites. A failing check refuses the
  merge before it exists, so it cannot be pushed; that is all that refuses it (land_verdict).
  A check that did not reach a verdict is NOT RUN, which is never a pass: it is named in the
  verdict and in the receipt, and the nightly runs it (README.md, "NOT RUN").

  THE ONE ESCAPE is git's own `--no-verify`. It cannot be prevented; it is recorded. After
  the fact (post-commit, post-merge) a commit whose tree this check never passed, or a main
  that moved to a tree without a land receipt, raises an escalation in the ledger the lead's
  session reads at every session start and turn end (`escalate.sh`), and is appended to
  `<git-common-dir>/richos-autocheck/bypass.log`.

Which copy of this file runs is chosen by the hook shim: the one committed at HEAD, else the
one on main, else (the land that introduces it) the one being merged. A branch's commits are
checked by its own version; a land into main is checked by main's.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The commit check sees exactly the bytes being committed
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Hunt part 2, finding 10 (2026-09-30). The commit check ran the lint on the WORKING TREE, so
# that changed-path lint saw unstaged edits too, and then approved the INDEX. A bad staged
# edit whose unstaged replacement passed was committed with no record, and a clean staged
# edit was refused over unstaged work the commit does not hold. The land refuses a working
# tree that differs from what it commits (land_from_index); a branch commit cannot, because
# committing part of the work in progress is how atomic commits are made.
#
# So, for the length of the check, the working tree IS what is being committed. The design is
# pre-commit's `staged_files_only` (pre-commit.com, MIT), taken as design: the unstaged
# difference is saved as a binary patch and untracked files are moved into this worktree's
# git directory; `git checkout -- .` makes the working tree equal the index the commit is
# written from; the checks run; the patch is applied back and the files moved back. Ignored
# files stay where they are: they are never committed, and a check needs its build caches and
# installed dependencies. The lint still reads the working tree, as it always has; that tree
# now holds the committed bytes and nothing else.
#
# If a check is killed while edits are set aside, or they cannot be put back, they stay in
# ASIDE, and every later commit check refuses, naming the directory and how to restore it,
# until it is gone. Nothing is ever set aside on top of them.
#
# The restore never overwrites bytes written after the work was set aside (recheck N01,
# 2026-09-30). The checks can take minutes, and the engineer keeps editing: a tracked file
# that differs from the index when the restore starts was written during the check, by the
# check or by an editor, and nothing can tell which. The old fallback, when the patch did not
# apply, ran `git checkout -- .` over the whole tree and so reset every such file, including
# ones the patch never names. Now a file the patch does not name is left exactly as found. A
# file the patch names that changed during the check is where the engineer's edit and the
# newer bytes collide: the newer bytes are moved into CHANGED under ASIDE first, then
# `git checkout-index` (which refuses to write over a file that exists) and the patch put the
# engineer's edit back, and the commit is refused with both named. The only window left is the
# one inside every git write: bytes landing between git reading a file and git writing it.

# own the changed files (proof-for.sh --gate), each check stopped at CHECK_CAP_SECONDS and the
# whole gate at GATE_CAP_SECONDS. What did not reach a verdict inside them is NOT RUN, named in
# the receipt, and never blocks; the nightly (nightly-local.py) still runs everything and stays
# the release gate. A failing check blocks; that is all (land_verdict). Adoption ledger §2.4,
# T3 Code's release gating: affected checks only, every job capped at 10 minutes.

# A LARGE LAND RUNS IN ROUNDS (2026-10-02). The combined land of 13 finished fixes
# (cc/zach-opus-e2fix1, 214 checks) was refused four times with no failing check: each attempt
# ended at the 900 s cap and its one retry did too. Measured from those attempts, the checks
# that reached a verdict took 6608 s between them (native-android-app 471 s, contract-integrity
# section Q 261 s, proof-run 260 s, ...; 36 never reached one), and a run kept only about three
# running at once: every start waits for total CPU under CEO ruling §77's 80% line, which the
# gate's own checks hold the Mac above. So the plan needed about 2200 s however quiet the Mac
# was when it started, and no single cap fits every selection: a cap scaled from planned weights
# trusts dated data that is wrong in both directions (README.md, "A check planned past its cap").
# Instead the gate runs ROUNDS of at most GATE_CAP_SECONDS each. A round keeps every pass (the
# runner reuses a validated pass on the same tree and inputs) and the next round runs only the
# checks that still have no verdict. It stops when every check has one, when a check times out
# at its own 600 s cap a second time (a hang is a hang), when a round decides nothing new (the
# next one would not either), or at GATE_MAX_ROUNDS: the total bound is
# GATE_MAX_ROUNDS x GATE_CAP_SECONDS = 5400 s, about twice what this land needed. Every round
# waits for admission and a proof-run slot at most GATE_CAP_SECONDS, the same number each time:
# until today the first run passed what was left of the gate (893 s) and its retry 900 s, the
# waits were part of every check's identity, and the retry reused nothing.

# A MUTATION PASS NEVER RUNS IN THE MERGE (2026-09-30). The merge of cc/zach-opus-q1 (4e73fd89)
# selected `scripts/operator-fences-mutation.test.sh`, a unit whose whole job is the fence
# suite's mutation pass (planned 1408 s): a comment in it names `ci-unit-weights.tsv`, the land
# changed that file, and the engine's selector maps a file to every unit that mentions its name
# (ci-affected-units.sh, "basename dependency (conservative)"). It ran into its 600 s cap while
# the Mac stayed too busy to start anything else, and the gate passed with 60 of 63 checks NOT
# RUN. The selector is right to be conservative; the merge is the wrong place for the pass. So
# an engine unit that IS a mutation pass is never started here, whatever selected it: one named
# `<suite>-mutation.test.sh`, or one whose header says `# merge-gate: mutation-pass`. It is
# named NOT RUN and the nightly engine run (nightly-engine.py) runs it with every other unit.
#
# The passes suites run at their own end (about seventy engine suites and three app suites
# invoke a `*.mutation.sh` or `*.mutation.py` harness) are switched off here the other way: the
# gate runs every check with MUTATION_SWITCH, each harness's first line reads it, prints NOT RUN
# and exits 0, and the suite's own checks still run and still decide. The nightly engine run
# sets it to 1 (every pass on), and so does the app nightly's workspace gate; unset, as an
# engineer runs a suite by hand, the engine harnesses run as they always did. The lead's
