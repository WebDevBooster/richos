# install.sh — put the automatic checks into a repository's hooks, and PROVE git will call them.
#
# Usage:
#   install.sh [<repo>]              install (default: the repository this file is in)
#   install.sh --check [<repo>]      report each hook; exit 1 if any is missing or unreachable
#   install.sh --uninstall [<repo>]  remove the hooks this installed, and nothing else
#
# WHAT IT INSTALLS: shim.sh, copied to <git-common-dir>/hooks/ as pre-commit,
# commit-msg, pre-merge-commit, post-commit, post-merge and pre-push. Every linked worktree of the
# repository (native, ~/ab/richos-wt, Codex's, the nightly's) shares that one directory,
# so one install covers every committer. The shim runs the committed autocheck.py; see its
# header for what each hook checks.
#
# WHY "PROVE": on this Mac core.hooksPath is set globally, and it REPLACES .git/hooks. A hook
# placed there runs only because the global dispatcher (femcboost's
# install-git-identity-guard.sh) chains to "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/hooks/<name>".
# So the chain is checked for each hook name, as engine/scripts/install-ref-forensics.sh
# checks it for reference-transaction, and a hook that would never be called is reported.
#
# A hook file that this did not write is never overwritten: it is reported and the install
# refuses, because replacing it would silently remove somebody else's check.
#
# It also registers the merge driver for the two verification maps (merge.richos-verification-pins,
# see below), which --check reports and --uninstall removes.

# THE MERGE DRIVER FOR THE TWO VERIFICATION MAPS (2026-10-05). Every branch that changes a pinned
# reader renews its sha256 pin, so two branches built in parallel conflicted in
# docs/development/verification-input-qualifications.json and
# richos/engine/scripts/lib/verification-dependencies.json on every merge, and each time somebody
# took one side and re-ran renew-verification-pins.py by hand. The .gitattributes beside each map
# names this driver; it merges them as JSON, keeps every entry from both sides and regenerates
# the pins from the merged files (merge-verification-pins.py). Repository config, so it reaches
# every linked worktree, like the hooks.
