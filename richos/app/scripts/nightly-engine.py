"""nightly-engine.py — every engine unit, with every mutation pass, once a night, as a job of its own.

    nightly-engine.py [--commit REV] [--state-dir DIR] [--app-state-dir DIR] [--dry-run]

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-30). The merge gate runs only the checks a change owns, each capped at
600 s, and leaves the mutation passes to the nightly (autocheck/README.md). The app nightly
(nightly-local.py) has no engine gate: it ran the workspace suites' passes and nothing else of
the engine. So the fence suite's mutation unit, the passes about seventy engine suites run at
their own end, and every engine unit the gate cut at its cap ran nowhere. The lead's decision
on esc-20260930T223507Z-b12f0d6a: a nightly engine run of every unit, with its mutation passes,
as its OWN job, so it never gates or lengthens the app nightly's release (the CEO counts a
build's time from his order to a usable nightly); its failures reach the lead through
escalate.sh; then the merge gate switches the embedded passes off.

WHAT IT DOES
  1. Refuses to start (exit 75) while an app nightly holds its release lock
     (<app-state-dir>/release.lock, observed with a non-blocking flock that is released at
     once): the app nightly is never made to share the Mac with this. A lock file that does
     not exist means no app nightly ever ran from that state directory, so none is running.
     An unreadable one refuses (exit 2): unknown is not permission. The same observation is
     repeated every YIELD_POLL seconds for the whole run, because an app nightly can start
     after this one did and the app nightly never looks for this job: when one does, this run
     YIELDS (its runner's whole process group is stopped, exit 75, no escalation) so the
     release never queues behind engine work. A lock that becomes unreadable mid-run yields
     too (exit 2).
  2. Checks the commit out (default: main's tip) into a detached worktree of its own under
     the state directory, so a land moving main during the run changes nothing it reads, and
     the engine's leak canary watches a tree nobody else writes.
  3. Runs every unit `ci-units.sh units` lists through that commit's own proof-run.py, with
     RICHOS_MUTATION_PASSES=1 and RICHOS_FOURTEEN_MUTANTS=1 (every mutation pass on) and no
     --cap: each unit keeps the engine runner's own deadline, and the receipts check proves
     every unit ran. Admission is proof-run's (CEO ruling §77's CPU line), outside the main
     checkout, so a land's checks keep their priority.
  4. Anything that did not pass raises ONE escalation for the lead naming each check, its
     state and the logs. A run that could not produce a verdict raises one too.
  5. Removes its worktree however it ends (§54) and keeps the last KEEP_RUNS runs' logs.

It is started by hand or by a schedule, after the app nightly; nothing in nightly-local.py
calls it. Exit: 0 every unit passed; 1 something did not pass (escalation raised); 2 setup
refused or no verdict; 75 not started or yielded, an app nightly holds its release lock.

REFERENCE: adoption ledger §2.4 (release gating), COPY THE APPROACH: affected checks at the
merge, each short; the expensive passes run in a scheduled job of their own.
