# no-compile-time-paths.test.sh — the source-side half of "no build-machine path ships".
#
# THE DEFECT, AND WHY A SECOND CHECK EXISTS FOR IT. `no_host_paths.py` reads the BUILT
# bundle and is the guarantee. On 2026-09-18 it did its job: the nightly of `e6f62448`
# compiled, bundled, and was then refused because `RichOS.app` carried
# `/Users/alex/.richos-nightly/source/richos/app/src-tauri` — one line of Rust,
# `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")`, which `--remap-path-prefix` cannot touch because a macro's
# output is program data rather than compiler metadata. The cost of finding it there was a
# whole release build. `no_compile_time_paths.py` finds the same thing in under a second,
# on the source, and does not replace the artifact check: only the artifact can answer for
# a vendored library baking in `__FILE__` or a toolchain that starts leaking again.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR. A checker that reports clean is worth nothing until it has been
# made to report dirty. Every negative case below therefore has a positive probe beside it
# — the same input with the exemption removed — so "no finding" can never be passing for
# the wrong reason.
#
# Cases:
#   P1  the checker's own self-test passes (16 cases, including the two bugs it caught
#       in its first draft: a `//` inside a string, and a one-line `#[cfg(test)]` item)
#   P2  the REAL tree is clean
#   P3  the exact line that shipped on 2026-09-18, planted, is REFUSED and named
#   P4  a hand-written home directory in a string literal is REFUSED
#   P5  the same line inside `#[cfg(test)]` is NOT refused — with P3 as its positive probe
#   P6  `env!("OUT_DIR")` inside `include_bytes!` is NOT refused (this is how the phone app
#       is embedded), and used as a VALUE it IS — the probe and the case in one file
#   P7  a placeholder home (`/Users/you/`, `/Users/example/`) is NOT refused
#   P8  a missing root is exit 2, never a clean pass over nothing
#   P9  the phone app is reachable from where build.rs looks for it — the check that would
#       have failed the moment the 2026-09-18 move landed with a stale relative path
