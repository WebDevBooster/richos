"""review-walk.py — the app's second review on the real app: a planted defect is asked to be
changed, the coordinator continues the work, the recheck passes and the work lands.

Slice 4 of richos-hq docs/plans/2026-10-09-automatic-second-review-and-t3-ideas.md (§4 row 4,
"one test VM walk: a product job with a planted defect gets changes-requested, Stu continues,
the recheck passes, `integrate` lands"), with Sage's check beside it. His words, the acceptance
criterion (§113): "A regular RichOS user can never be expected anything even remotely close to
that. So, this all must be completely automated." So nothing in the job is pressed or typed but
the job itself; an Approve the app asks for is pressed and COUNTED, never hidden.

Run by run-walk.py, which holds one guest slot for this run only, boots the guest and removes
the clone. The fixture home must carry the planted teammate first (the leases read the team at
launch):

  review-walk.py --seed-team FIXTURE_HOME
  run-walk.py --bundle ZIP --home FIXTURE_HOME --engine ENGINE --report REPORT -- \\
      review-walk.py --out DIR --expect-sha SHA [--within SECONDS]

WHAT IT DOES, in the guest, never on the host's screen (CEO ruling §65):
  identity   the running app says it was built from --expect-sha
  team       the seeded teammate `builder` is in the guest's <app data>/team/
  first-run  adopt-walk.py's: company "Acme" with a folder that is a Git repository
  fixture    the Acme package (acme/__init__.py, acme/text.py with no slugify yet) committed
  connect    command-walk.py's: the folder connected as a repository
  watcher    the app's own review-watch child (slice 4) runs: its record names a live pid
  job        JOB, typed into the composer once
  observe    nothing else is pressed or typed; an Approve the app asks for is pressed and counted.
             Watched until the assignment closes or --within. Then the verdict, read from the
             saved records (work receipts, their briefs, the repository).

THE PLANTED DEFECT is the teammate's, not the job's: `builder` (seeded below) leaves out one
thing the user asked for on a first attempt (removing leading and trailing hyphens), writes tests
that pass without it and says nothing of it; on a continuation it fixes what it is told. Only a
reviewer who reads the user's own words, and checks the work against them, finds it.

THE PASS LIST, each from the records:
  1 every reviewer's brief starts with the user's turn verbatim (the slice's Rust and Python half)
  2 the first review of builder's work asked for changes
  3 the coordinator continued that work (a worker receipt whose continuation names it)
  4 the recheck of the continuation passed
  5 integrate landed it: the continuation's receipt is integrated and Acme's main has slugify
    removing leading and trailing hyphens (run in the guest)
  6 the assignment closed settled
  + Approve presses, counted (none is the "completely automated" his words ask for)

In --out: report.json, verdict.json, receipts.json, briefs/, acme-log.txt, the app's logs. Exit 0
only when every step and every pass line passed. Every app instance is quit by run-walk.py's
stop.sh (CEO §54).
