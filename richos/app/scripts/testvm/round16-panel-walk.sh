# round16-panel-walk.sh — the Claude Code quota panel against round 16, on the real app, in one
# guest run, dark and light.

#   run-walk.py --bundle <RichOS.app.zip> --home <empty dir> --engine <engine.tar.gz> \
#     --report <json> -- round16-panel-walk.sh <out-dir>
#
# run-walk.py passes the VM name first, and quits the app, stops the guest and deletes the
# clone when this returns (CEO §54). FIXTURE-DRIVEN, exactly as fill-first-walk.sh:
# fake-claude-fill-first.pl answers every `claude` call from per-account usage files, so no real
# Claude account is read, signed in or switched. It captures, in <out-dir>, each in dark AND
# light, named for the round-16 state it matches (richos-hq design/mockups/rounds/round-16/):
#   1-one-account       ~ fresh / low: one account, "+ Add account" beside Refresh
#   2-two-accounts      ~ two / choice-pause: Home and Work as lanes, the one sentence, Pause
#   3-switched-sheet    ~ switched: Switch chosen, Home past its line, Work in use
#   4-switched-line     ~ switched-line: Rich's one line in the conversation, with a turn in
#                         progress and three agents working on Work (the working row)
#   5-fast-sheet        ~ fast-switch: the moved line with its ghost, the speed on the card
#   6-fast-alert        ~ fast-alert: Rich's alert in the conversation, then a turn with the
#                         working row
#   7-back-to-normal    ~ normal-again: Rich's line when the speed comes back down, then a
#                         turn with the working row
# The working row ("3 agents working on Work") exists only while a turn of this conversation
# runs (main.rs get_worker_status reads the conversation's lease during its turn), so each
# conversation state that round 16 draws with the row holds one turn open for its shots.
