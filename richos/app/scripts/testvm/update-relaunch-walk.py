"""update-relaunch-walk.py — a downloaded update relaunches by itself when nothing runs (CEO feedback 2026-10-06, item 1).

Run by run-walk.py, which holds one guest slot for this run only, boots the guest and removes the clone:

  run-walk.py --bundle ZIP --home EMPTY_DIR --engine ENGINE --report REPORT -- \\
      update-relaunch-walk.py --out DIR --expect-sha SHA --endpoint URL --expect-version VERSION

run-walk.py passes the owned VM name as the first argument. The bundle is the build under test,
whose version must be OLDER than the release --endpoint names (a development build of a branch
is `<version>-dev.<sha>`, which sorts below every nightly of the same version). --endpoint is a
published release's own `latest.json`, so what is downloaded, verified and staged is a real
signed release, and nothing about it is written here.

HIS WORDS. "there was no work going on at the time. So, there was nothing that could be
interrupted. In this case, the app should automatically re-launch immediately after downloading
the new version."

WHAT IT DOES, in the guest, never on the host's screen (CEO ruling §65):
  install    the bundle under test copied to the per-user destination (~/Applications/RichOS.app,
             where the CEO runs it) and started from there with --endpoint, by its pid
  identity   the running app says it was built from --expect-sha
  first-run  adopt-walk.py's: company "Acme"; the first conversation is the app's own
  ready      the update is offered once the app's own first turn has ended ("Download update")
  draft      an unsent sentence typed into the composer; the window's frame read
  download   the cue pressed, then "Download update"; within --within seconds: the notice
             "Restarting into RichOS <version>" is on screen (photographed), the old process
             ends, a new one starts by itself, its log says "update activated: <old> -> <new>",
             and the installed bundle is <new>
  after      the new process has a window with the same frame, the same conversation, and the
             unsent sentence still in the composer (photographed)

Every app instance is quit by run-walk.py's stop.sh (CEO §54): this walk records the relaunched
process's pid in the run state, so stop.sh quits the instance that is actually running.
Exit 0 when every step passes.
