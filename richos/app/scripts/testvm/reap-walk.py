"""reap-walk.py — a dead lease never leaves its tool commands running (the product reap).

Run by run-walk.py, which boots the guest, holds <TESTVM_ROOT>/guest.lock and removes the clone:

  TESTVM_APP_MODEL=sonnet run-walk.py --bundle ZIP --home EMPTY_DIR --engine ENGINE --report REPORT -- \\
      reap-walk.py --out DIR --expect-sha SHA

run-walk.py passes the owned VM name as the first argument. `--steps a,b,c` runs a subset against
a guest someone is already holding (hold-walk.py). The bundle AND the engine must both carry the
reap: the supervisor that reaps is the engine's (`scripts/provider-supervisor.py`), and a dev
bundle takes the engine it is given (run.sh --engine sets RICHOS_ENGINE_DIR).

THE QUESTION. richos-hq docs/plans/2026-09-27-product-reap-gap-design.md §3.2: every teardown of a
product lease ends the tool commands its `claude` started (a tool shell is its own session and
process group, out of reach of the old group kill), and nothing that was not ended is taken.

WHAT IT DOES, in the guest, never on the host's screen (CEO ruling §65):
  identity      the running app says it was built from --expect-sha
  first-run     adopt-walk.py's first run: memory setup declined, company Acme with a Git folder
  connect       Settings -> Connected repositories -> Acme's folder, so an assignment has a real
                repository (without it the front desk has been seen to invent one)
  seed          reap-guest.py copied into the repository as heartbeat.py, and into the payload
  watch         reap-guest.py's death watcher started: every recorded heartbeat's end, guest ms
  unrelated     `sleep` started in the guest by the harness: must survive every step
  normal        a short heartbeat assignment ends BY ITSELF (.done written) and is never reaped
  stop          a background and a foreground heartbeat; Stop pressed; both end within the bound
  quit          both again; the app's Quit; the question names the command; "Quit and stop the
                work"; both end within the quit bound; app.log and the reap log say so
  crash         relaunched; both again; the app SIGKILLed by the pid it launched with
  claude-crash  relaunched; both again; the lease's `claude` SIGKILLed by the pid read from its
                own state file (G9 in the VM, design C9)
  idle-cpu      one supervisor's CPU time over an idle minute
  unrelated-alive  the harness's `sleep` is still alive, then ended by its recorded pid

THE GRADE REFUSES a case whose pids were not recorded by the commands themselves (the reason P15's
reap-lead-crash half regraded to PREMISE-FALSE): a heartbeat records its own pid, group and start
before it beats, and a case with none is REFUSED, never passed. Exit 0 when every step passes.
Every app instance is quit by run-walk.py's stop.sh (CEO §54).
