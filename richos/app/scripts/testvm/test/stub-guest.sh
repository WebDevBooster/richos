#
# `tailnet.sh` reaches its guest through ONE indirection (`tsg`), so pointing
# that at this script exercises every decision in the join — the flags, the
# order, the key handling, the refusal classification, the name read-back —
# against a machine that boots in no seconds and costs no memory.
#
# It records every command it was handed to $STUB_LOG, which is how the tests
# assert the things that matter most and are hardest to see: that the auth key
# never appears in a command line, and that it is deleted from the guest.
#
# Behavior is steered by $STUB_MODE:
#   ok             a tailnet that works
#   invalid-key    `tailscale up` refuses the key the way 1.102.4 really does
#   certs-off      joined, but the tailnet will not certify the node
#   never-running  `up` returns 0 and the daemon never reaches Running
#   no-cert        Running and certified, but `cert` hands back nothing
#   daemon-never   `tailscaled` is not running and never will be
#
# And one knob that is not a mode, because it composes with every one of them:
#   STUB_DAEMON_READY_AFTER=<n>   the daemon is ABSENT until the n-th status
#                                 read, then present. This is the guest Ray and
#                                 Echo actually met: booted, ssh answering,
#                                 Homebrew's launch daemon still coming up.
