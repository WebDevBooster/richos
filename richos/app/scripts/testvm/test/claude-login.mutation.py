"""claude-login.mutation.py: proves the claude-login cases can fail.

Removes ONE property of testvm/claude-login.sh at a time, in a throwaway copy
of testvm/, runs `test/run-tests.sh "claude login"` there, and requires the
NAMED case to fail and the mutation to have applied. The shipped file is never
opened for writing.

    testvm/test/claude-login.mutation.py      exit 0 = every property load-bearing

About a minute: each mutant runs the login cases, two of which wait on a
one-second keeper loop. Not run by run-tests.sh, which stays fast; run it after
any change to claude-login.sh's push or keep.
