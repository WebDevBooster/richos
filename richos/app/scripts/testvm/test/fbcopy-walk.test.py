"""fbcopy-walk.sh's exit status is its verdict (the CEO's feedback of 2026-10-06, items 3 to 7).

No guest: the walk is copied into a box beside stand-in guest.sh, ax.sh, shot.sh and relaunch.py,
and `sleep` on PATH returns at once. ax.sh's `tree` prints one fixed screen text. Every guest
operation failing must end the walk nonzero; a screen holding everything the feedback asks for
exits 0; the same screen with an m-dash on it, or with the splash row back in the quick settings,
exits nonzero and names the item."""
