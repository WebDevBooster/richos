"""dictation-sheet-walk.py — the Dictation sheet from no grants to a dictation in Try it here (dictation plan slice 2).

Run by run-walk.py, which holds one guest slot for this run only, boots the guest and removes the clone:

  run-walk.py --bundle ZIP --home EMPTY_DIR --engine ENGINE --report REPORT -- \\
      dictation-sheet-walk.py --out DIR --expect-sha SHA --wav SPOKEN.wav --model GGML.bin [--model-id small.en]

run-walk.py passes the owned VM name as the first argument. `--steps a,b,c` runs a subset.

THE QUESTION. Slice 2 of richos-hq docs/plans/2026-10-08-dictation-anywhere.md (revision 2,
section 9): "VM walk from no grants: turn the switch on; the microphone prompt appears and OCR
(scripts/qa/ocr-find.sh) reads Iris's sentence in it; Allow is pressed through the accessibility
tree; the Accessibility prompt appears; the guest grant is written; within 2 s the sheet says On
with no relaunch, and Try it here receives a dictation. Then the refused path: the sheet shows the
drawn denied line and Open System Settings opens the Accessibility pane. Then a second copy with
dictation on shows 'On even when RichOS is closed'. If the guest's prompt cannot be clicked through
the accessibility tree, the walk proves the prompt by OCR, grants the row, and says so in its
report." Measured against the CEO's words: "yes, also keep the sentence Iris wrote for when macOS
shows when RichOS asks for the microphone" and his "On even when RichOS is closed" (2026-10-08).

WHAT IT DOES, in the guest, never on the host's screen (CEO ruling §65). The app is started with
`open -n -a` (relaunch.py) and the tool is the app's child, never a binary run from ssh (minor 8).
No sound is played anywhere (CEO §53): the spoken sample is a file that RICHOS_VOICE_INPUT_WAV puts
through the identical capture path. The ways in are shown through RICHOS_DICTATION_PREVIEW=1, the
walks' preview, because DICTATION_READY stays false until slice 5.
  identity      the running app says it was built from --expect-sha
  stage         every TCC row for com.richos.app removed (no grants at all); the sample and the
                speech model copied in
  relaunch      the app relaunched on that guest with the preview and the sample as its microphone
  switch-on     Settings, Dictation, the switch pressed
  mic-prompt    macOS's microphone prompt is on screen, OCR reads Iris's sentence in it, and its
                Allow is pressed through the accessibility tree (or, when no process in the tree
                offers it, the Microphone row is written and the report says so)
  ax-prompt     macOS's Accessibility prompt is on screen (OCR)
  granted       the guest's Accessibility row is written; the tool makes its key tap and the sheet
                says On, with the app's pid unchanged (no relaunch); the time from the write to the
                tool's line is measured (UNPROVEN in run 22: a row written behind tccd's back
                never reaches a running process)
  granted-settings THE WAY A PERSON DOES IT (slice 5's brief): the Accessibility row removed, the
                app relaunched and the switch pressed to the Accessibility prompt; then System
                Settings, Privacy & Security, Accessibility is driven through the accessibility
                tree: RichOS's switch turned on, the guest's admin password entered where macOS
                asks; the running app's sheet must say On with no relaunch (the app's pid
                unchanged), and the tool must make its key tap
  try-it        one dictation of the sample into Try it here; its text is the guest's own decode
  refused       the Accessibility row removed, the app relaunched: the sheet says the drawn denied
                line with Open System Settings beside it
  open-settings Open System Settings brings System Settings to the front on Accessibility
  second-copy   the Accessibility row back; a second copy of the bundle, on its own home with
                dictation on: its tool finds the key taken (exit 3), and its Settings row and sheet
                say "On even when RichOS is closed"; that copy is then quit by its pid

Exit 0 when every step passes. Every app instance is quit by run-walk.py's stop.sh (CEO §54); the
second copy is quit here, by its own pid, before the step ends.
