"""handoff-real-walk.py — the weekly-switch handoff on the real app, real `claude`, his two real
accounts, in one guest run (richos-hq docs/plans/2026-10-07-weekly-switch-handoff.md §4, round 2).

Run by run-walk.py, which holds one guest slot for this run only, boots the guest and removes the
clone. His two sign-ins reach the guest through run.sh (Home, and Work from the app's Account 2
folder; access tokens only). The fixture home must carry the two Opus teammates first:

  handoff-real-walk.py --seed-team FIXTURE_HOME
  TESTVM_APP_MODEL=opus run-walk.py --bundle ZIP --home FIXTURE_HOME --engine ENGINE --report REPORT -- \\
      handoff-real-walk.py --out DIR --expect-sha SHA --corpus CORPUS.tar [--within SECONDS]

run-walk.py passes the owned VM name as the first argument.

WHAT IT DOES, in the guest, never on the host's screen (CEO ruling §65):
  identity   the running app says it was built from --expect-sha
  team       the seeded Opus teammates (scribe, checker) are in the guest's <app data>/team/
  corpus     the Acme repository: --corpus (a tar of lib/*.py) unpacked and committed
  first-run  adopt-walk.py's: company "Acme" with that folder
  connect    command-walk.py's: the folder connected as a repository
  accounts   Account 2 "Work" written into the app's claude-accounts.json at the folder run.sh
             signed in (<home>/claude-accounts/2), the app relaunched, the quota panel opened and
             both accounts' weekly readings read from the app's own view (claude-quota.json)
  watch      handoff-watch.py started in the guest (every record the handoff writes, timed)
  cutoff     relaunched with RICHOS_TEST_WEEKLY_CUTOFF=1:<Home's weekly now + 1>; the view's
             weekly point for Home must say so
  job        JOB, typed into the composer at once: one teammate reads every file and summarizes
             it into MODULES.md, committing after every five files (Home moved 2 points in 24 min
             on 2026-10-07 09:21-09:45Z, so the order can come early); another reviews; then it
             is landed. Refused when Home already reached the cut-off (run 9).
  work-reading  the relaunched app reads Work (the quota panel's Refresh every 45 s, only until
             it has; counted): the app switches only to an account it has read
  observe    nothing is pressed (an Approve the app asks for is pressed and COUNTED: the pass
             line "with no step by anyone" then fails). Watched until the job closes or --within.
             Then the verdict below, from what was saved.

THE PASS LIST (plan §4, verbatim), each read from the saved records:
  1 The order arrives at the cut-off.
  2 The worker's branch holds its work commits, then a `RichOS handoff:` commit.
  3 A successor on Work starts at that commit, with the handoff text in its brief.
  4 The successor's diff does not rewrite summaries already committed (nothing redone).
  5 The job is reviewed, landed and closed with no step by anyone.
  6 Record how long the handoff took (sets `H`).
  + his 3-5 minute expectation: each ordered teammate's time from the order to its end; over 5
    minutes is a finding.

In --out: report.json (steps), verdict.json (the pass list with evidence), handoff-watch.jsonl,
acme-log.txt, MODULES.md, transcripts/{home,work}/ (both accounts' Claude transcripts, for the
token count), screenshots, the app's logs. PRIVATE: it holds his accounts' transcripts; keep it
outside every repository. Exit 0 only when every step and every pass line passed.
