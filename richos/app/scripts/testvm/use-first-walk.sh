# use-first-walk.sh — feedback item 8 on the real app, in one guest run: the CEO picks which
# Claude account is in use now ("Use this one now"), the pick survives a relaunch, and the
# automatic switch at 99% of the week still happens from the account he picked.
#
#   run-walk.py --bundle <RichOS.app.zip> --home <empty dir> --engine <engine.tar.gz> \
#     --report <json> -- use-first-walk.sh <out-dir>
#
# His words (richos-hq docs/ceo-input/2026-10-06_01/feedback.md, item 8): "I should be able to
# change/switch which account drains first. Because for testing now I should be able to switch
# to the account that currently has 97% weekly to see if it will auto-switch correctly after
# reaching 99% weekly." And (2026-10-06_02): the quick-settings quota row shows the WEEKLY window.
#
# run-walk.py passes the VM name first, and quits the app, stops the guest and deletes the clone
# when this returns (CEO §54). FIXTURE-DRIVEN, exactly as fill-first-walk.sh and
# round16-panel-walk.sh: fake-claude-fill-first.pl answers every `claude` call from per-account
# usage files, so no real Claude account is read, signed in or switched. In <out-dir>:
#   0-quick-settings-one     the Settings menu, one account: the row reads "N% weekly used"
#   1-two-accounts           Account 1 (30% weekly) in use, Work (97% weekly) next
#   2-work-in-use-{dark,light}  after Use this one now on Work; claude-accounts.json inUse "2"
#   3-turn-on-work           a turn after the pick; calls.log shows it ran under Work's folder
#   4-after-relaunch         the app relaunched: Work still in use
#   5-switched-at-99         Work's week at 99%: Account 1 in use again, Rich's one line
#   6-quick-settings-two     the Settings menu, two accounts: "Account 1 N% weekly · next ..."
# EXIT STATUS: 1 when the setup fails or any capture or check below fails (named at the end);
# 0 only when every capture was saved and every check read what it should.
