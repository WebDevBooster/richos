"""The test VM's two guest slots: each is held ONLY while one run executes in a guest.

  slots.py status                           who holds which slot, right now
  slots.py run [--wait SECONDS] -- COMMAND  hold one slot for exactly COMMAND's run
  slots.py check                            (run.sh) print the slot, exit 0, only inside a held slot

THE RULE (the CEO, 2026-09-27): *"do I want the work to be BLOCKED AND PISSED AWAY like this
because the current worker might need the VM for a 5-second-long fart? Do I want HOURS OF
DEVELOPMENT TIME TO BE PISSED AWAY FOR EVERY 5-SECOND FART???"*

  * A slot is held only while a run executes in the guest: boot, the run's steps, cleanup.
    It is released the instant that run ends.
  * No reservations. Nothing keeps a slot "for later", across a job, a build or a debugging
    session. Anything that needs a guest again takes a free slot again.
  * A walk that truly needs one guest across several steps (a 30-minute observation) is one
    run, and holds a slot for that run's length only.
  * A caller waits only while every slot is executing somebody's run.

WHY TWO. Until 2026-09-27 there was one guest lock, and a job that needed the guest for a few
minutes of a multi-hour task queued everybody else behind it (3 h 58 min for one agent that
day). This Mac has 10 cores and 24 GB; a guest takes 4 cores and 7 GB (lib.sh), and Apple's
Virtualization framework runs at most two macOS guests at once on one host. Two is therefore
both what fits and the ceiling: TESTVM_SLOTS may lower it to 1, never raise it.

SLOT 1 KEEPS THE OLD NAME, `<TESTVM_ROOT>/guest.lock`, on purpose: a run-walk.py from a
checkout older than this file still takes that lock, so it still counts as one slot, and the
new code can never put a third guest beside it. Slot 2 is `guest-2.lock`.

ADMISSION, in order, every attempt: a free slot (a nonblocking flock, no sample spent); fewer
guests running than there are slots (tart's own list, so a guest booted by an old checkout
is counted); reserve.py's CPU and memory rule (CEO ruling §77); then THE GUEST'S OWN MEMORY.
A refused sample RELEASES the slot before waiting, so nobody queues behind a caller that is
itself waiting. `--wait SECONDS` bounds the whole admission; 0, the default, refuses at once.

THE GUEST'S OWN MEMORY, measured 2026-09-27 18:56Z: two guests admitted 1.5 s apart both
passed reserve.py's rule, because a guest takes its memory only as it boots. 40 s later the
host was at 99% CPU, memory pressure warn, 32% free and swapping out 120 MB/s (it had been
71% free, 0 MB/s). reserve.py samples what is already used; a guest is 7 GB about to be used.
So a guest is admitted only when the kernel's available memory, less what every running guest
may still take (its RAM less what its VM process already holds) and less this guest's whole
RAM, leaves GUEST_MEMORY_FLOOR_MB for everything else on the Mac.

A GUEST NEVER OUTLIVES ITS SLOT. run.sh records the slot it booted under in its run state,
and refuses to boot at all unless a slot is held by one of its own ancestors (`check`). When a
slot is released, any guest still recorded against it is stopped with stop.sh first: a caller
that forgot its cleanup cannot turn a run into a hold.
