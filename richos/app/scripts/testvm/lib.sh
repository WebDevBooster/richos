# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THE HARNESS IS FOR
# ===========================================================================
# 2026-09-19. The CEO, twice within the hour:
#
#   "So, every engineer will keep opening the app making me unable to do
#    anything here or WHAT???"
#   "WHEN THE FUCK WILL THERE BE A PROPER FUCKING SETUP THAT WILL ENABLE
#    SUPER FAST DEVELOPMENT AND NOT PATHETICALLY SLOW SNAIL PACE DEVELOPMENT?"
#
# Until today an on-screen proof of the RichOS app meant a window on HIS Mac,
# taking HIS focus, one agent at a time, serialized behind his working day.
# This harness moves every such proof into a macOS virtual machine on the same
# Mac: the app opens on the guest's virtual display, nothing appears on his
# screen, and two proofs can run at once because they run in two guests.
#
# ===========================================================================
# EVERY DECISION HERE IS DELIBERATE — NO THIRD-PARTY DEFAULT IS TRUSTED
# ===========================================================================
# Each constant below that differs from the tool's own default says why.

# tailscaled … /var/run/tailscaled.socket: no such file or directory'"*. Echo saw
# the same sentence on `.9`. Both times a later `tailnet.sh join` worked — in 4 s
# for Ray, 37 s for Echo, which is the spread that tells you a fixed sleep is the
# wrong instrument: whatever number is picked is too long for one machine and too
# short for the other.
#
# So the join waits for a FACT — the CLI getting an answer out of the daemon —
# and these two knobs only bound how long it is prepared to wait for it. 60 × 1 s

# landed in ~/.local/share/claude/versions in the two days before this was
# written), so the guest tested the app against a `claude` the CEO no longer
# runs, and nothing in the output said so.
#
# `~/.local/bin/claude` IS A SYMLINK into ~/.local/share/claude/versions/<v>,
# and its target changes at every host update. Resolve it before hashing or
# copying: hashing the link reads 48 bytes of path text, which would compare
