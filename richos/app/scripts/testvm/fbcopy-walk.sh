# fbcopy-walk.sh — the CEO's feedback of 2026-10-06, items 3 to 7, read off the real app in one
# guest run.
#
#   run-walk.py --bundle <RichOS.app.zip> --home <empty dir> --engine <engine.tar.gz> \
#     --report <json> -- fbcopy-walk.sh <out-dir>
#
# run-walk.py passes the VM name first, and quits the app, stops the guest and deletes the
# clone when this returns (CEO §54). Fixture-driven like round16-panel-walk.sh: the fake
# `claude` (fake-claude-fill-first.pl) stands in, so no real account is read or signed in.
#
# It reads the accessibility tree (what the app really shows, as text) and photographs:
#   1-quick-settings   the universal Settings menu: NO "Splash screen" row (item 7)
#   2-general-settings the rail gear's popover: the "Splash screen" group, and "Keep the stored
#                      output" with Forever chosen on this fresh install (items 6 and 7)
#   3-phone            "Use Rich from your phone": "RichConnect for RichOS" where it is offered,
#                      no "RichOS Connect", no "private pilot" (items 4 and 5)
# and greps every tree for an m-dash or n-dash (item 3). Verdicts go to <out-dir>/verdict.txt,
# one line each, PASS, FAIL or UNKNOWN (a screen that could not be read); the walk exits 1 when any
# line is FAIL or UNKNOWN.
