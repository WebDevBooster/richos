# WHY THIS QUITS BY PID AND NEVER BY KEYSTROKE
# ===========================================================================
# 2026-09-19, 18:10Z: a harness quit an app by sending Command-Q through System
# Events. System Events addresses the FRONTMOST process, the app under test was
# not frontmost, and the keystroke landed on the CEO's Terminal. A quit that
# depends on which window happens to be in front is not a quit, it is a coin
# toss with somebody else's work on the other side.
#
# `kill -TERM <pid>` addresses the process that was actually launched. It
# cannot hit a bystander, and it works whether or not the app has a window,
# whether or not it is frontmost, and whether or not it is responding.
#
# CEO §54: a test instance of the app is garbage, and garbage is always cleaned
# up. If cleanup fails, this script says so LOUDLY and names what to delete by
# hand, rather than exiting 0 and leaving a 25 GB surprise.
