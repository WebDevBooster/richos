"""fake-claude-bug-report.py - the guest's `claude` for the Bust a bug walk (bug-report-walk.sh).

Rich's write-up is ONE printed turn (`richos_core::bug_report::writer_args`: `--print
--input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json --verbose`, no tools). For that call this
reads the one user message on standard input the way Claude Code does, answers with a `result`
line whose `result` is Rich's report, and records what it was given in
<dir>/writer-prompts.log: the prompt's words, and for a picture its media type, its size and its
first bytes. The picture itself is written to <dir>/rich-saw.<ext>, so the walk can show what
Rich was shown.

The report quotes the user's own words (so a file path they typed reaches the card and must be
left out there) and names the company the walk registered and a person, so the walk can see all
of them replaced by stand-ins on the card and absent from what reaches the issues endpoint.

Every other call (the conversation, its quota reads, sign-in status) goes to the fill-first fake
(`fake-claude-fill-first.pl`, beside this file in the guest), unchanged.
