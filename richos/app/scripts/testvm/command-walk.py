"""command-walk.py — a background assignment runs a real tool command and reports its result.

Run by run-walk.py, which holds one guest slot for this run only, boots the guest and removes the clone:

  run-walk.py --bundle ZIP --home EMPTY_DIR --engine ENGINE --report REPORT -- \\
      command-walk.py --out DIR --expect-sha SHA [--within SECONDS]

run-walk.py passes the owned VM name as the first argument. `--steps a,b,c` runs a subset, still
as one run under run-walk.py.

THE QUESTION (esc-20260927T093052Z-85f3303f). The CEO's §50: work runs in the background and its
results come back when they land. Before this walk's fix, a task the back end carried out itself
— a command he asked to have run — was reported as "It stopped before it finished. No work was
started, so nothing was landed." seconds after the command had started, and the back end's own
report of what it printed was thrown away. This walk asks for one real command on a fresh
install and checks that its result reaches him.

WHAT IT DOES, in the guest, never on the host's screen (CEO ruling §65):
  identity   the running app says it was built from --expect-sha
  first-run  adopt-walk.py's: memory setup declined, company "Acme" registered with a folder that
             is a Git repository, the business questions declined
  connect    that folder connected through Settings > Connected repositories (a company folder
             alone is not consent: `entity.rs` `connected_repositories`)
  watch      adopt-watch.py started in the guest (assignment states on the guest's clock)
  task       typed into the Mac's composer: run the harmless test command `git log --oneline`
             yourself in my Acme folder, and tell me when it has finished and what it printed
  observe    within --within seconds the assignment reaches a closed state. If the provider asks
             him to approve the command, Approve is pressed once per request, from the Under the
             hood panel, well inside the call's 300 s deadline. PASS needs all of: the assignment
             is a task and is `settled`; its last notice carries the repository's own HEAD short
             sha AND subject, read in the guest with git; no notice on it says "No work was
             started"; the back end's own hook evidence has a Bash PostToolUse running git.
             Evidence is written to --out.

FIVE MORE STEPS, run with --steps (esc-20260927T093052Z-85f3303f's leftovers):
  background     "start `sleep N && git log --oneline` in the background and tell me when it has
                 finished": PASS needs the back end's own hook record to show the command run with
                 run_in_background; the assignment seen `running` with "A command it started is
                 still running." while he already had its first words; then `settled` as
                 answered, with a LATER notice carrying the head's short sha and subject, raised
                 no earlier than N seconds after the send (the finish cannot be reported before
                 the command could end). Evidence: background-observed.json.
  deadline       checks the running app was launched with RICHOS_PERMISSION_DEADLINE_MS=--deadline-ms
                 (permissions.rs: it can only shorten the shipping 300 s), so a late approval takes
                 seconds to reach. Launch it so: TESTVM_APP_ENV=RICHOS_PERMISSION_DEADLINE_MS=20000
                 in run-walk.py's environment (run.sh, lib.sh app_env_args).
  late-approval  a command that needs his approval (`date +%s > /tmp/richos-late-approval.txt`);
                 NOTHING is pressed until the assignment is `blocked` -- the call has returned at
                 its deadline and the turn has ended -- then Approve is pressed once. PASS needs the
                 command's own output (its start, in whole guest seconds) within --late-bound
                 seconds of the press, and the assignment closed `settled`. The 2026-09-27
                 diagnosis measured (133.479, 137.542] s on the build before 76e977dc. Evidence:
                 late-approval-observed.json.
  next-job       a background command (sleep --yield-seconds, then echo a marker unique to the run),
                 and while it runs a second job (--task). PASS needs the second job closed without the
                 marker in what he was told; the first job still open, waiting on its command, when the
                 second closed; then the first `settled` as answered with a later notice carrying the
                 marker; its obligation closed on that answer; nothing about reviews, merges or closing.
                 Evidence: yield-observed.json. (background also checks the obligation and the words.)
  relaunch       relaunch.py after a first run (bgdone2 item 3), observed: one relaunch, then every
                 5 s up to --relaunch-within seconds the recorded pid, every process of the app's
                 executable with its parent, the recorded pid's windows, and whether the composer is
                 back. A launch after the first run lands on the HOME SCREEN by design (ui/home.js),
                 so its door ("Talk to Rich") is pressed once and the thread opened, and the moment
                 is recorded. PASS when the composer is back. Evidence: relaunch-observed.json, relaunch-app.log, and on a
                 miss relaunch-tree.txt and relaunch.png.

TWO STEPS FOR THE PROTO-TEAMMATE SHELF, slice 1 (richos-hq docs/plans/2026-10-06-proto-teammate-shelf.md
§2), run as --steps identity,first-run,connect,team,task,agents. The front desk's leases open at
launch, before any step, and a lease reads its team once (plan §1), so the user's own teammate is
seeded into the FIXTURE HOME before run-walk.py boots: `command-walk.py --seed-team FIXTURE_HOME`
writes FIXTURE_HOME/Library/Application Support/com.richos.app/team/walkmate.md and exits. `task`
registers the proven task, which opens the back end's lease.
  team           the seeded <app data>/team/walkmate.md is in the guest (refused otherwise).
  agents         waits up to --within seconds for the back end's lease (the one given richos_work),
                 then asks the back end to name every agent type its Agent tool lists. PASS needs all
                 of: the question registered and closed (the back end answered it); its last notice
                 names dean, clark, reed, frank, pierce and walkmate; every running lease's
                 --plugin-dir registers the always-active five, and the back end's walkmate too; all
                 six on coordination/.claude/agents; no shelf name (engine/team/shelf) on either.
                 Evidence: agents-observed.json.

Exit 0 when every step passes. Every app instance is quit by run-walk.py's stop.sh (CEO §54).
