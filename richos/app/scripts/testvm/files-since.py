"""What was written, and where, between two moments: a file-date search with a positive control.

Runs INSIDE a test guest (push it with guest.sh --push). Standard library only.

  files-since.py mark <file>
      Create or touch <file>; its modification time is the moment.

  files-since.py scan --since <marker> [--until <marker>] --root <dir> [--root <dir>...]
                      [--inside <dir>...] [--declared <dir>=<reason>...] [--harness <dir>...]
                      [--baseline <scan.json>] [--control <file>...] [--named <word>...]
                      [--tolerate-unreadable <dir>...]
      Every file, symlink or newly born directory under the roots whose modification,
      change or birth time is after --since (and not after --until), classified. JSON on
      stdout. Exit 0 when every control was found and nothing NAMED sits outside --inside;
      1 when something named does; 2 when a control was not found, a --root could not
      be listed, or a directory below a root could not be listed and lies outside every
      --tolerate-unreadable directory (the search itself is not working, so its silence
      proves nothing about the subtree it never read).
      A guest's system folders always hold a few unreadable directories, so the caller
      names those folders with --tolerate-unreadable: what is unreadable under them is
      counted (tolerated_unreadable_count) and does not fail the search. An unreadable
      directory anywhere else, such as the home the app under test runs in, does.

WHY A POSITIVE CONTROL. "The search found nothing outside the folder" is a claim about
the search as much as about the app. A root that was not readable, a clock compared the
wrong way round, or a path filter that drops everything all produce the same empty
answer as a clean app. A control is a file written deliberately inside the window, in a
place the search must cover, whose name carries a --named word: if the scan does not
report it, and would not have flagged it as named had it not been declared a control,
the scan is broken and exits 2.

CLASSES, in the order they are decided:
  control   a --control file
  inside    under an --inside directory (where the thing under test is allowed to write)
  declared  under a --declared directory, with its reason (written by design, e.g. a link)
  harness   under a --harness directory (the walk's own payload and tools)
  named     outside all of the above, and its path contains a --named word
            (case-insensitive) — the finding this search exists for
  baseline  the same path also changed in the --baseline window, when nothing ran
  other     none of the above: reported for a person to read, never silently dropped

Symlinks are reported, never followed, so a linked directory is counted once, at the
real path it points to, under whatever class that real path has.
