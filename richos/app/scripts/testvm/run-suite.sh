# run-suite.sh — run ONE host-screen suite in a test-VM guest, from executables this Mac
#                built, and answer with that suite's own result.
#
#   testvm/run-suite.sh <gui-host> <path to the suite>
#
# `run-tests.sh` calls this for a suite that sources lib/gui-launch.sh when RICHOS_GUI_HOST
# names the test VM; <gui-host> is that value. Nothing appears on this Mac's screen: the
# suite's boots happen on the guest's own display.
#
# =========================================================================================
# WHAT HAPPENS, IN ORDER
# =========================================================================================
#
#   1. BUILD HERE. The guest is a clean macOS with no cargo and no checkout, on purpose, like
#      the one gui-proof-in-vm.sh uses, so this Mac builds what the suite launches:
#      `gui_prebuild` (lib/gui-launch.sh) makes richos-tauri, carrying this checkout's
#      commit, and the gui_boot_machine example. A build that fails is exit 1, a verdict
#      about the code, exactly as it is when the suite builds for itself. No guest is held
#      while anything compiles.
#   2. STAGE the payload: those two executables, this scripts directory (the suite, its
#      libraries and the guest half, suite-in-guest.sh) and the source files the suite's
#      static cases read (src-tauri/src for S1, tauri.conf.json for C3, the updater's lib.rs
#      for C2). The engine the suite provisions from travels beside it, and so does the
#      delivered runtime (RICHOS_RUNTIME_DIR) when the engine carries none of its own.
#   3. GUEST, for the suite's run only. run-walk.py takes one of the two guest slots, boots a
#      fresh clone of the test VM's base with no app (--no-app), runs suite-walk.sh, and
#      stops and deletes the clone however the run ends. suite-walk.sh pushes the payload,
#      runs the suite in the guest's GUI session in PREBUILT MODE, and brings back its exit
#      code and its results folder.
#
# <gui-host> says that the caller wants a guest; the guest itself is always a fresh clone of
# TESTVM_BASE_VM (testvm/lib.sh), as every guest has been since slots.py (2026-09-27).
#
# =========================================================================================
# EXIT
# =========================================================================================
#
#   the suite's own exit code, when it ran in the guest
#   1  the executables did not build (a verdict about the code), or the guest was NOT
#      cleaned up: a clone left on this Mac is a failure whatever the suite said (§54)
#   2  this Mac could not give the suite a guest: no slot within TESTVM_SUITE_WAIT seconds,
#      a guest that did not boot, a payload that did not arrive, a suite that never reached
#      its end, or a suite that passed but whose results folder did not come back (a failing
#      suite keeps its own exit code then). A fact about this machine, which run-tests.sh refuses unless declared.
#   64 a usage error
#
# A suite that declares `# run-tests: host-only: <reason>` is refused with exit 2 and that
# reason; front-door.test.sh is the one today (it drives a published release on this Mac).
#
# SETTINGS: TESTVM_SUITE_WAIT (seconds to wait for a guest slot, default 1800).
# RICHOS_GUI_PREBUILT names executables already built and builds nothing (said in the
# output). TESTVM_RUN_WALK replaces run-walk.py and TESTVM_GUEST_EXEC replaces guest.sh:
# run-tests.test.sh's stand-in guest uses both.
