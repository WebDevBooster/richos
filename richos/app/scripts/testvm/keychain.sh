# THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR
# ===========================================================================
# Ray, nightly `.7` defect 4 and `.8` defect 5; Echo again on `.9`. The fixture
# home's `Library/Keychains` used to be a SYMLINK to the CEO's real keychain
# directory — which was rightly removed. What replaced it is an EMPTY directory,
# and an empty directory is not a keychain:
#
#     "It is now a real empty directory, so /usr/bin/security still finds no
#      keychain and still raises the Keychain Not Found dialog. I created a
#      throwaway keychain inside the guest to finish the walk, and it then
#      prompted for its password twice more, once per pairing. On the CEO's Mac
#      the login keychain exists and is unlocked at login, so this is a fixture
#      gap and not his problem — but it costs every future walk the same detour.
#      The fixture should ship a real, unlocked, empty login keychain."
#                                                    — Ray, .8 audit, defect 5
#
# That detour is not free in the way a detour usually is. `.8` defect 2 measured
# **120 seconds of "Getting this Mac ready…"** with the `Keychain Not Found`
# dialog sitting behind the sheet, and a tester who does not know to go looking
# for that window reads it as the app hanging.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY THE KEYCHAIN IS MADE HERE AND NOT IN provision-guest.sh
# ===========================================================================
# It belongs to the FIXTURE HOME, and the fixture home arrives per run: run.sh
# copies it in at step 3 and the app is launched with `HOME` pointing at that
# copy. `provision-guest.sh` runs once, against the base image, and has never
# heard of a payload directory. A keychain baked into the base image would be in
# the wrong home and would be found by nothing.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY THE UNLOCK IS DONE IN THE GUI SESSION, AND NOT ONLY OVER ssh
# ===========================================================================
# Keychain lock state is held by `securityd`, and an ssh login is its OWN
# security session — a different one from the Aqua session `open -n -a` launches
# the app into. So an unlock performed in the ssh session is not obviously the
# unlock the app will meet. `launchctl asuser <uid>` puts the unlock in the same
# bootstrap context the app runs in, which is the one that has to be right.
#
# Both are done, and `check` reports which one the app would actually see, so
# this file states a measurement rather than a belief. Never the host's
# keychain, in any branch: every path here is prefixed by the guest's payload
# home and executed inside the guest.

#
# **EVERY PROBE IS BOUNDED, AND THAT IS NOT DEFENSIVE PROGRAMMING — IT IS THE
# DEFECT ITSELF.** Measured 2026-09-20 while testing this file: run against a
# home whose `Library/Keychains` is empty — Ray's fixture exactly —
# `security add-generic-password` DOES NOT RETURN AN ERROR. It raises
# `SecurityAgent`'s `Keychain Not Found` dialog inside the guest and waits for a
# click that no headless guest can produce. The first version of this function
# hung for over ten minutes on that case and had to be killed. That is the same
# stall Ray timed from the other side as *"120 seconds of Getting this Mac
# ready…"* (.8 defect 2) — so a diagnostic that inherits it is a diagnostic that
# reproduces the bug it is meant to report.
#
# Two things prevent it, and the first is the cheap one:
#   1. a keychain FILE that is not there is answered from `test -f`, with no
#      `security` call made at all;
#   2. anything that runs has a process-group deadline, including its children. A probe that is killed is reported as "no answer", which
#      is the truth: a keychain that needs a click is unusable to this app.
