#
# The CEO's §115 (2026-10-09), built to round 21: the user says what is wrong, Rich writes it
# up, the user reads the whole report and sends it, and it is filed as a GitHub issue; a failed
# send is kept on the Mac and sent once the connection is back. This walk drives exactly that,
# with the guest's own `claude` replaced by fake-claude-bug-report.py (Rich's write-up names
# the walk's company and a person) and RICHOS_BUG_REPORT_API pointed at github-stand-in.py on
# 127.0.0.1:8765. The reporting account's token is a throwaway put into the GUEST's login
# keychain under the app's own name (com.richos.app.bug-reports / github-reporting-token).
#
# PASS when:
#   1  Bust a bug (Settings) starts the exchange in the conversation: Rich asks what went wrong;
#   2  the answer typed in the composer comes back as the report card, "Not sent yet", with the
#      company, the person and A FILE PATH WITH SPACES IN IT (~/Library/Application Support/
#      Client Plans/budget.xlsx) replaced by stand-ins, and nothing has reached the endpoint;
#      Rich was given what was on the screen: its visible words (the conversation's "Noted.")
#      and a JPEG picture of the window, taken with no permission prompt, and the digest says
#      "Looked at the screen you were on" (second review rv-20261009T102303Z-1c3dda1d-4c78,
#      findings 1 and 6);
#   3  Send with the endpoint down leaves the card "Waiting to send · saved on this Mac", with
#      Rich's offline line, and the report on disk under bug-reports/waiting;
#   4  once the endpoint is up, the report goes out BY ITSELF: the card says "Sent · #412",
#      Rich says "You're back online, so I sent your bug report.", the endpoint received one
#      POST to /repos/WebDevBooster/richos/issues with "Bearer <the keychain token>", and its
#      body carries neither the company nor the person;
#   5  CANCEL WHILE A SEND IS IN FLIGHT (the same review, finding 2): a second report waits
#      (endpoint down), the endpoint comes back holding its answer 15 s, and Cancel report is
#      pressed while the retry's request is in flight. The card says "Canceling…", then
#      "Sent · #413", and Rich says "It had already gone out before I could cancel it."; never
#      "Canceled · nothing sent" and never "Nothing was sent";
#   6  screenshots of the report, the waiting card, the sent card and the in-flight cancel in the
#      dark theme and the light theme, for comparison with round 21.
#
