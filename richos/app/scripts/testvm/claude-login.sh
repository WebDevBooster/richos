#
# ===========================================================================
# THE QUESTION THIS EXISTS FOR
# ===========================================================================
# The CEO, 2026-09-20: *"What happens when the Claude login expires in the
# VM?"*
#
# The honest old answer was "it never had one". `docs/testvm.md` said signing
# in was a human action — `ssh admin@<ip> 'claude /login'`, once per guest, on
# a guest that is DELETED at the end of every run. That is a human errand per
# proof, which is the same shape as the Tailscale URL sign-in this harness
# already replaced with a key.
#
# The new answer is that the guest never holds a login longer than one run: it
# is projected from the host at the start of every run and destroyed with the
# clone. ONLY the access token and its metadata cross this boundary. A copied
# refresh token lets the guest rotate the host login without sharing its lock
# or writing the replacement back. A fresh clone does not prevent that race.
# The access snapshot can expire during a run; it cannot renew the host login.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY THE VALUE IS NEVER ON A COMMAND LINE — AND HOW CLAUDE CODE ITSELF DOES IT
# ===========================================================================
# A secret in argv is in the process table of the machine that runs it and in
# every log that records a command line. This harness already refuses that for
# the Tailscale key (`--auth-key file:<path>`, never inline), and the same rule
# binds here.
#
# `security` has a mode for it, and Claude Code uses that mode itself. Read out
# of the 2.1.277 binary:
#
#   i = `add-generic-password -U -a "${account}" -s "${service}" -X "${hex}"\n`
#   if (i.length <= 4032) security -i   <- the command arrives on STDIN
#   else … argv …                          (their fallback; NOT taken here)
#
# So this file does the same: the payload is hex-encoded and handed to
# `security -i` on stdin, in the guest, over ssh. Measured here on 2026-09-20:
# the host's credential is 524 bytes, so the line is ~1.1 kB — comfortably
# inside the 4032 the same code treats as the limit. If it ever exceeds that,
# this REFUSES rather than taking the argv fallback.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE NAME THE GUEST WILL LOOK UP, AND WHY TWO ARE WRITTEN
# ===========================================================================
# From the same binary, the service name is built as:
#
#   `Claude Code` + OAUTH_FILE_SUFFIX + "-credentials" + scope
#   scope = ""  when CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR is unset
#         = "-" + sha256(configDir).hex.slice(0,8)   when it is set
#
# and the account is `process.env.USER || os.userInfo().username`.
#
# OAUTH_FILE_SUFFIX is "" in the shipped build (the non-empty variants are the
# `-local-oauth` / `-custom-oauth` development configurations). `run.sh`
# launches the app WITH `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<fixture home>/.claude`, so the name
# the app resolves is the scoped one — and a `claude` a tester starts by hand
# over ssh, with no such variable, resolves the bare one.
#
# Both are written, with the same value, into the same disposable keychain.
# Writing two rows of a throwaway keychain costs nothing; predicting which one
# the process under test will ask for, and being wrong, costs a whole walk.
#
# The ACCOUNT is the GUEST's user, never the host's: the app runs as `admin` in
# there, so an item filed under `alex` would never be found.

# ===========================================================================
# A LONG RUN OUTLIVES ONE ACCESS TOKEN (2026-09-26)
# ===========================================================================
# The guest holds an access token and never a refresh token, so it cannot renew
# anything. An access token lives 8 hours (the host's current one: written
# 11:03:15Z, expiring 19:03:15Z), Claude Code renews it once it is inside five
# minutes of expiry (`now + 300000 >= expiresAt` in 2.1.283), and walks here run
# up to 105 minutes (ray10). So a run that starts late in a token's life would
# see its model turns fail halfway with "Login expired" in the guest.
#
# The answer keeps the one rule (only THIS Mac ever renews this Mac's login, with
# its own lock and its own store) and adds two things:
#   1. push: when the token about to be handed over is inside that five-minute
#      window, or already past it, THIS Mac's own `claude` is asked to renew its
#      own login first (host_renew), and the fresh token is what crosses.
#   2. keep: for the run's lifetime, the host item's MODIFICATION TIME is read
#      every TESTVM_CLAUDE_KEEP_SECONDS (attributes only, never the value); when
#      this Mac has renewed, the new access snapshot is pushed. When the guest's
#      copy enters the window and this Mac has not renewed (an idle Mac makes no
#      model calls), the host is asked once, the same way.
# The guest's `claude` rereads its store at least every 30 s (its credential
# cache), so a pushed token is in use before the old one runs out.
