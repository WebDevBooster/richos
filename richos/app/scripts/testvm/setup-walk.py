"""setup-walk.py — the video tools download in the background from launch, and first setup does
not wait for them (CEO 2026-10-07).

Run by run-walk.py, which holds one guest slot for this run only, boots the guest and removes the clone:

  run-walk.py --bundle ZIP --home EMPTY_DIR --engine ENGINE --report REPORT -- \\
      setup-walk.py --out DIR --expect-sha SHA

run-walk.py passes the owned VM name as the first argument.

THE QUESTION. The CEO, 2026-10-07: "the download of the essential files starts right away and
independently of the other stuff. So that by the time the user is done with their intial setup all
those essential files will already have downloaded or nearly finished downloading in the
background." And: "Important is that the user can do all the other stuff for the initial setup
(like typing their company name, selecting a folder that will be associated with that etc) while
the audio tools are seamlessly downloading and installing in the background." The video tools are
yt-dlp and both pinned speech models (media-tools plan §2): small.en for voice and
large-v3-turbo-q5_0 for transcription, 1,061,655,396 B together (`model-pins.json`).

The guest has Claude Code and the engine (run.sh's RICHOS_ENGINE_DIR) and no video tools, so the
first-run questions it asks are the memory question and the company question.

WHAT IT DOES, in the guest, never on the host's screen (CEO ruling §65). Every step writes its
moments to ONE timeline on the guest's clock, each with how much of the two models is on disk then:
  identity    the running app says it was built from --expect-sha
  meanwhile   the models start arriving with nothing pressed; then first setup is done as a new
              user does it: the memory question answered "Set it up" and closed, the company name
              typed, its folder given, "Add this company" pressed, the first conversation created.
              PASS when the download started before any press and every one of those moments came
              while it was still running.
              (On a build where the setup sheet lists "my video tools", the walk presses its "Set it
              up", which is the only way that build fetches them, and goes on as soon as it can.)
  arrived     the download finishes by itself: the app's own line says the video tools are
              installed; tools/yt-dlp verifies (launcher record = file hash) and answers --version
              on the runtime's Python; BOTH models are on disk with their pinned sha256
  voice       voice is ready with NO relaunch (a4facb643: "the window asks voice again when a model
              arrives ... so voice switches on without a relaunch"): within 60 s the app's own
              "[richos] voice: ready on this machine" line is printed (main.rs voice_readiness
              prints a line on EVERY ask), and the talk control (#talk-toggle), pressed once as a
              person does, turns into "Stop talking" rather than putting up the offer to download
              a model that is already installed (#voice-model-get). Then pressed again to stop.
              The press opens capture, so the app must be launched with a stand-in for the
              microphone: TESTVM_APP_ENV=RICHOS_VOICE_INPUT_WAV=/Users/admin/voice-silence.wav in
              run-walk.py's environment; the step writes two seconds of silence there first, and
              the microphone grant a person gives with Allow is written as voice-walk.py writes it
              (grant_microphone), so no privacy prompt comes up.
  relaunch    the app is relaunched; the boot line says "nothing missing." and no sheet comes up

CEO §53: no sound is played. Every app instance is quit by run-walk.py's stop.sh (CEO §54).
Exit 0 when every step passes.
