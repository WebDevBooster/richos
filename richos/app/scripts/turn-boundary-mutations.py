"""turn-boundary-mutations.py -- every door of the turn-boundary adoption, watched going red.

WHY: CEO ruling §88, "The user should be able to answer on their phone just as well as they can
answer on the desktop app." Every entrance that runs his turns (typed, spoken, the phone's
drain, front-desk priming, the boot's reconciliation) must adopt the work those turns wrote
down (`adopt_at_the_turn_boundary` in src-tauri/src/main.rs, `Spine::take_ended_turns`). A test
only proves an entrance if it FAILS when that entrance's door is taken away, so each mutant
below takes away ONE door, or puts back the pre-fix shape of one entrance, and the named tests
must fail. A mutant caught only by some other test, or by a compile error, does not score. The
unmutated copy must pass first.

THE CHECKOUT IS NEVER WRITTEN. The tracked sources at HEAD are exported (`git archive`) into a
private copy at a FIXED path, the untracked build input `richos/app/ui-dist` is copied beside
them, and every mutant is applied to and restored in that copy. It builds into a PRIVATE target
beside the copy, never the shared Cargo cache: cargo judges a workspace member fresh by mtime
and keys it relative to the workspace root, so a mutant compiled into the shared cache is what
the next older checkout runs (esc-20260926T113721Z-70ef679e, measured on this harness's first
version). The copy and its target are deleted at the end unless --keep is given; with --keep and
the same --copy, a rerun is incremental. (`operator-mutations.py` mutates
richos-core in place; these mutants reach the Tauri shell, whose build reads richos/web,
richos/mobile and richos/engine/voice/models too, so a copy is the one way not to touch them.)

  turn-boundary-mutations.py --check          every mutant applies exactly once, every test it
                                              names exists; no cargo (turn-boundary-mutations.test.sh)
  turn-boundary-mutations.py [--copy DIR] [--keep]
                                              the full run: one cargo test per mutant. Run by hand,
                                              from richos/app, through the admission:
                                              scripts/testvm/reserve.py --wait 600 -- python3 scripts/turn-boundary-mutations.py

Exit: 0 every mutant proven (or, with --check, applies); 1 otherwise.
