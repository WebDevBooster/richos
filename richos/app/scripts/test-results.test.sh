# test-results.test.sh — a failing test is always named, and a later run cannot erase it.
#
# THE INCIDENT THIS HOLDS TO ACCOUNT (2026-09-25). A proof run's `native-android-app` failed with
# "133 tests completed, 1 failed" and named no test; the one report that did lived in the
# checkout's Gradle build folder, and `native-android-ui`, the next suite of the same run (same
# task, same folder), replaced it with 139 passes before anyone read it. The CEO: "are you
# shitting me?? what now???"
#
# So the fixture here is that incident, small: two fake suites whose fake Gradle writes ONE
# shared results folder, the first failing and the second passing over it, run through the real
# `run-tests.sh` and the real `proof-run.py`. The first suite's failing test must still be named,
# and its result file must still exist, after the second has replaced the shared folder.
#
# CASES
#   N1-N7  lib/test_results.py reads JUnit XML, an Xcode bundle (through a stand-in
#          xcresulttool), test logs, an engine shard's log, and an unreadable result file, and
#          names each failure; and the last error of a check that died before any test ran
#   L1     two test runs on one lock and one shared folder, overlapping: each run's copy holds
#          its own result, and the second waited for the first
#   R1-R5  the incident through run-tests.sh, serial and concurrent: named in the summary and in
#          --results-out, the result file kept, the shared folder really overwritten, the kept
#          store bounded; a suite with no test named by its last error
#   R6     R2 with a admitted only after b started (nightly .32's shape): the order still holds
#   P1-P2  the same through proof-run.py: named beside the check and in summary.json, the
#          result file in the run's own log directory, nothing left for the suite that passed
#   M1-M4  MUTATIONS, each of which this file must catch: the fake Gradle called directly (the
#          shape before the fix), the copy removed, the lock removed, and run-tests.sh no
#          longer giving a suite its own folder
#
# run-tests: no-host-screen: fake suites and fake Gradle runs that write files under mktemp; nothing is launched on any screen
