# build-runtimes.test.sh — the delivered Python's dependency closure, as build-runtimes.py
# checks it inside every fresh runtime build.
#
# A runtime is built once and reused (`nightly-local.py`'s `runtime()`), so the closure line in
# build-runtimes.py runs only when a runtime is rebuilt, which is rare. This suite runs THE SAME
# snippet (the module's CLOSURE_CHECK, read from the file, not a copy) now:
#   1. under the delivered runtime's Python when RICHOS_RUNTIME_DIR names one, else under the
#      Python 3 running this suite, so the check itself is proven to pass on a real interpreter;
#   2. it names ctypes and libproc, which provider-supervisor.py needs to reap a lease's tool
#      commands (the product reap gap design C8);
#   3. a positive probe: the same check with a module that does not exist FAILS, so a pass
#      above is not a snippet that cannot fail.
#   4. ffmpeg and ffprobe arrive as upstream zips: a zip holding exactly its one named file is
#      installed executable, and a zip with anything else in it is refused (synthetic zips only).
