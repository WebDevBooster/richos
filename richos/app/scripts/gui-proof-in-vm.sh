# gui-proof-in-vm.sh — watch a candidate's own bundle start, in a guest, and write down

#
#   gui-proof-in-vm.sh --run <run-id> [--vm <name>] [--out <path>] [--wait <seconds>]
#   gui-proof-in-vm.sh --bundle <RichOS.app.zip> --commit <sha> [--vm <name>] [--out <path>] [--wait <seconds>]
#
# --wait: how long to wait for one of the test VM's two guest slots (testvm/slots.py) and
# its CPU admission; default 3600, so a build that is walked away from still gets its proof.
#
# =========================================================================================
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# =========================================================================================
#
# The CEO, 2026-09-19: *"So, every engineer will keep opening the app making me unable to do
# anything here or WHAT???"*
#
# `nightly-local.py build --no-host-screen` answers that by holding back every suite that
# boots the app, so a candidate is built, signed, notarized and walkable without one pixel
# reaching his Mac. The price is that nobody has watched the thing start. `publish` refuses
# such a candidate until `--gui-proof` names evidence that somebody did, and THIS is what
# produces that evidence — inside a `testvm` guest, on the guest's own virtual display,
# with nothing on the host's screen.
#
# =========================================================================================
# WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT — the distinction is the whole value of the file
# =========================================================================================
#
# It boots THE ARTIFACT THE RELEASE WILL PUBLISH: the signed, notarized, stapled bundle out
# of the candidate's own staging directory, on a clean macOS 15 guest with no developer
# environment, no cargo, no repository and no `~/.claude` of the operator's. That is closer
# to a customer's first run than anything on a developer's Mac can be, and it is the
# question `publish` actually needs answered: does the thing about to become installable
# start, and does it draw a window.
#
# IT IS NOT `gui-boot.test.sh`, AND IT DOES NOT CLAIM TO BE. That suite builds a debug
# binary from the checkout and asserts B0-B8 and C1-C5 over a synthetic machine — engine
# resolution through candidate 6, the Info.plist's shape, the company registry, the corpus
# pointer. This file asserts one thing about a different artifact. So the proof it writes
# says `suite=shipped-bundle-boot`, never `suite=gui-boot.test.sh`, and `publish` accepts
# either while recording which it got. A proof that borrowed the other's name would be the
# most useful lie in the release chain.
#
# =========================================================================================
# THE GARBAGE (CEO ruling §54) AND THE HOST'S SCREEN
# =========================================================================================
#
# The guest clone, the app inside it and the fixture home are all garbage the moment the
# verdict is read, and every one of them is cleaned up however this script ends — including
# on INT and TERM. Where cleanup fails it SAYS SO LOUDLY and names what to delete by hand,
# rather than exiting 0 over a 25 GB surprise.
#
# Nothing here touches the host's display, power, session or input state: no `pmset`, no
# `caffeinate`, no keystroke, no `open` on this machine. The app is launched, watched and
# killed inside the guest, by pid (`testvm/stop.sh`'s own rule, written after a Command-Q
# through System Events landed on the CEO's Terminal).
