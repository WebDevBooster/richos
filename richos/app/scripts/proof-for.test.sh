# proof-for.test.sh — what `proof-for.sh` answers, checked against THREE REAL LANDS.
#
# =========================================================================================
# WHY THE FIXTURES ARE REAL COMMITS AND NOT SYNTHETIC DIFFS
# =========================================================================================
# A synthetic diff proves the rules fire. It cannot prove the rules are RIGHT, because the
# author of the fixture and the author of the rule are the same person and they agree by
# construction. So the three fixtures here are lands that actually happened in this
# repository, each chosen because its commit message says in plain words what it changed —
# which is an independent statement of what the proof should be:
#
#   315baf03  phonelive3  the phone's send, its outbox, the pairing screen, the web app
#   e7facc99  harness1    one UI check, one core module's ordering, five testvm scripts
#   62e5affd  shots1      104 regenerated reference shots and the stability library
#
# Each case therefore asserts what the LAND says its own subject was, not what the script
# happens to print today.
#
# THE THIRD ONE IS THE HONEST CASE AND IT IS KEPT DELIBERATELY. shots1 maps to all 55 UI
# suites — no reduction at all — because it touched `lib/shot-stability.js`, which every
# suite reaches through `harness.js`. A targeting tool that quietly pretended otherwise
# would be worse than none, so the assertion is that it says 55 AND names the one file that
# caused it.
