# The RichOS native iPhone app's extensions and release readiness (build plan §5.0, stream I3):
# the notification service extension, "Share to Rich", the microphone and recorder's pure parts,
# the TestFlight tool, the app icon, the privacy manifest and the Release product.
# The platform code runs on this Mac with swiftc, the TestFlight tool against a fake App Store
# Connect, and the Release product is checked on disk; S7 then runs the share sheet, the platform
# effect handler and the notification platform on ONE simulator this suite creates and deletes. A host without
# macOS, Swift, Xcode, XcodeGen, Node or the external SSD prints NOT RUN and exits 2; a failure on a
# capable host is red.
# run-tests: no-host-screen: `simctl boot` starts a dedicated simulator without Simulator.app; snapshots are rendered in-process, never from the Mac's screen
