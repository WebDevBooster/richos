//! **SCREENSHOTS AND FILES INTO THE MAC COMPOSER** — CEO ruling §86 (2026-09-24, "his
//! daily-driver app runs his existing team"), and the one thing the terminal gives him that the
//! Mac window did not: `richos-hq/docs/plans/2026-09-24-daily-driver-readiness.md` §4 X3
//! ("Screenshots and files he hands over") and §6 step 3 ("drop and paste onto the composer,
//! stored and described exactly as the phone's are").
//!
//! # One storage path, not two
//!
//! Everything that decides what a file IS — the accepted types, the byte sniffing, the 25 MiB
//! ceiling, ten files and 100 MiB per message, the name sanitizing, the private modes, the
//! atomic writes and the block Rich reads — is `phone/attachments.rs`, called unchanged. This
//! file only answers the two questions the phone never had: how bytes get from the window to
//! that desk, and what the window may name.
//!
//! * **Staged** under device `mac` ([`MAC_DEVICE`]), with the composer's draft id as the
//!   message id. A phone's device id is always `dev_…` (`phone/device.rs`), so the folders
//!   can never meet.
//! * **Committed** into `<app data>/attachments/<conversation>/<draft id>/` at Send, and
//!   described by [`attachments::describe_from`] with [`Origin::Mac`]. The words Rich reads
//!   are the phone's shape, headed `Attached on this Mac (…)`.
//!
//! # How bytes reach it
//!
//! * **A drop never hands the window a path it can choose.** Tauri's drag-and-drop handler is
//!   on for the window (the default), so the webview never receives the files; the WINDOW does,
//!   as paths. [`listen_for_drops`] records each drop's paths on a shelf here and tells the page
//!   only a drop number and each file's display name (`rich://file-drop`). The page asks for
//!   `(drop, index)`, and this file reads the path it recorded. A page that asks for a path
//!   the OS never dropped gets nothing: there is no command that takes a path.
//! * **A paste** (a screenshot on the clipboard, an image copied from Preview) arrives in the
//!   page as a `File`, and its bytes cross the IPC once, as a raw body
//!   ([`attach_pasted_file`]), never base64 in JSON.
//! * **A file the thread produced** (*Add to chat* in the Output panel, richos-hq
//!   `docs/prds/2026-10-05-output-side-panel.md` §5.4 and slice S7, §12.7). The page names an
//!   OUTPUT ID, never a path: [`output_attach`] resolves it against the active thread's record
//!   through `output_files.rs` (§5.1), runs its checks (§5.2: no link, no swapped file, a regular
//!   file), and reads the canonical path with `O_NOFOLLOW`. From there it is the drop's road
//!   exactly — the same kind by name, the same size refusal before the read, the same
//!   [`AttachmentDesk::stage_from`] and the same sentences. There is no second desk.
//!
//! # What this does NOT do, said rather than left to be discovered
//!
//! * **No file picker.** The brief is drop and paste; a picker needs a dialog plugin this
//!   build does not carry.
//! * **No thumbnails from disk.** A pasted image is previewed from the bytes the page already
//!   holds; a dropped one is shown as a named chip, because reading it back to the page would
//!   be a second copy of up to 25 MiB for a picture.
//! * Thread deletion does not reach these files, for the reason the phone's module gives.
