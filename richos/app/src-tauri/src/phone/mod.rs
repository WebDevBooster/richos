//! **THE PHONE CHANNEL — RichOS's first inbound network listener.**
//!
//! `richos-hq/docs/plans/richos-phone-client-2026-09-18.md` §2 and §4, and CEO decision §57:
//! *"the user is not expected to have something like Railway and I shouldn't provide that for
//! a free and open-source app. Instead, the RichOS app should have 'something' running on the
//! user's device (Mac in this case)."*
//!
//! The wire contract this implements is `docs/architecture/phone-channel.md`, which was
//! written and committed before either half was built so the phone app and this module are
//! built against one document rather than against each other.
//!
//! # The property this module gives up, and what replaces it
//!
//! The front-end plan's bar (c) used to read *"it opens no inbound port on his Mac"*. §57
//! deletes it: the Mac is now the server. That was a real property and it is being given up
//! deliberately, so the seven replacements in plan §2.5 are structural here rather than
//! advisory, and each one is named at the place that enforces it:
//!
//!  1. **The listener does not exist until he pairs a phone** — [`PhoneChannel::start`] is
//!     called from the pairing surface and nowhere else, and unpairing the last device calls
//!     [`PhoneChannel::stop`], which drops the socket rather than closing a door.
//!  2. **It binds LAN interfaces only, never `0.0.0.0`** — [`names::LocalNames`] enumerates
//!     the Mac's own addresses and [`listen`] binds each one by name.
//!  3. **TLS with our own leaf, and the phone pins our CA** — [`ca`].
//!  4. **Every route requires the paired device's credential, and everything else is a flat
//!     404** — [`device::verify`] and [`routes`].
//!  5. **The surface is four routes and no more** — [`routes::dispatch`] is an exhaustive
//!     match with one fall-through, and a test walks the whole path space against it.
//!  6. **Body-size and rate limits at the edge** — [`MAX_BODY_BYTES`], [`device::RateLimit`].
//!  7. **Being on his Wi-Fi is explicitly NOT authentication** — the pairing credential is.
//!
//! # What this module never touches
//!
//! It does not read the ledger, the raw event stream or a `Timeline`. It is handed the
//! `Visibility::Ceo` stream and a CEO-gated timeline payload, and it holds no handle that
//! could reach anything else — plan §4.2 (iii), and the reason it is a structural property
//! rather than a rule to remember.

// **THE QUESTION IS GONE, AND SO IS THE ANSWER** — CEO §61, 2026-09-18.
//
// A `Route` enum lived here for one day. It carried the user's answer to *"Where do you want to
// use it?"* across the bridge, because Urban's N1 found that `phone_begin_pairing` took no
// argument and `serving_plan` preferred the tailnet whenever a certificate would issue: he chose
// `At home only`, whose own sentence said *"there is no account to make"*, and got the Tailscale
// screen with his own account in step 2. That fix was right for the product it was made on.
//
// The next day §61 removed the second option: *"any mobile app or PWA is utterly useless within
// the home network. The desktop app is a much better tool in that case."* A product that asks no
// question cannot ignore an answer, so the enum, the argument and the token parser all went — see
// `serving_plan` below for what a Mac that cannot serve the one path gets instead, which is a
// refusal with a sentence rather than a second path.

/// **What the channel will actually serve**, once detection and `tailscale cert` have had their
/// say: which addresses to bind, and the certificate the phone will meet.

/// away from office i.e. outside the home network. Because any mobile app or PWA is utterly
/// useless within the home network. The desktop app is a much better tool in that case … The
/// RichOS desktop app will guide technical users (with the help of crystal-clear and ultra-simple
/// how-to screens in the app) to their Tailscale setup. That's it. The Tailscale setup is where we
/// start now."*
///
/// **SO THE FALLBACK IS AN ERROR, NOT A SECOND PLAN.** Every `return home` in the previous version
/// of this function answered a Mac that Tailscale could not certify with a `mm1.local` origin, a
/// self-signed certificate and sixteen taps on the phone. §61 does not rank that below the
/// tailnet; it says the thing it produces is useless. A Mac in that state is not *at home*, it is
/// *not set up yet* — which is a screen (`phone.js`'s three how-to states), reached because
/// `TailnetState` is not `Ready`, and never a channel that comes up promising something else.
///
/// `None` therefore means exactly one thing: **this Mac cannot serve the phone yet**, and
/// [`PhoneRuntime::start`] turns it into a sentence the user reads rather than a silent
/// substitution.
///
/// **What the user actually sees first is the how-to screen, not this refusal.** `phone_status`
/// carries the detected state on every poll, and `Set my phone up` is only on the screen when that
/// state is `Ready`. So `None` here is the race — ready when the sheet drew, not ready a moment
/// later when `tailscale cert` was asked — plus the one case detection genuinely cannot see
/// coming: the control plane refusing to issue.
///
