//! **WHERE THE PRIVATE KEYS LIVE** — plan §2.1: *"The private half goes into the macOS
//! Keychain and never leaves the machine"*, and §4.1: *"no shipped binary contains a
//! credential"*.
//!
//! Three private keys exist in this feature and all three are made on the CEO's own machine
//! at first pair: the certificate authority's key, the TLS leaf's key, and the VAPID signing
//! key. None of them is in a file he can copy, and none of them is in the bundle.
//!
//! # Why `/usr/bin/security` and not the Security framework
//!
//! `SecItemAdd` is the right call and it is `unsafe` FFI plus Core Foundation object
//! lifetimes, in a process that also holds the CEO's conversation. The shelled-out form is
//! three arguments and an exit code. This is start-up work that runs once per launch, so the
//! cost is a fork rather than a design.
//!
//! # THE ONE HONEST WEAKNESS, NAMED RATHER THAN LEFT FOR A REVIEWER TO FIND
//!
//! `security add-generic-password` takes the secret as `-w <value>`, which puts it in the
//! process table for the length of one `exec`. There is no non-interactive alternative:
//! without `-w` the tool reads the secret **from a human**, which is a window drawn on the
//! CEO's screen or a process hung forever. (This repository's own interactive-prompt guard
//! refuses the argument-less form for exactly that reason.)
//!
//! **AND THE SECOND THING THE TOOL CAN DO, which this doc did not say until a walk found it.**
//! `security` is GUI-capable. It can put a **`SecurityAgent`** window on his screen — *"Keychain
//! Not Found"*, or the ordinary *"security wants to use the 'login' keychain"* — and then wait
//! for it, for as long as nobody answers. `Command::output()` waits with it, so an unanswered
//! dialog used to be a pairing sheet frozen on `Getting this Mac ready...` with no bound and no
//! sentence (Ray's nightly `.7` walk, defect 3). Every call in this file now goes through
//! [`run_security`], which has a deadline, kills what outlasts it, and hands back
//! [`PhoneError::ToolTimedOut`] so the screen can say what happened.
//!
//! **What that exposure is actually worth: nothing.** Reading another process's arguments on
//! macOS requires being the same user, and a process running as that user can simply run
//! `security find-generic-password -w` and read the key out of the Keychain directly. The
//! window adds no capability to an attacker who does not already have the key. It is written
//! down here because the argument is the reason it is acceptable, and an acceptance with no
//! argument behind it is how a real weakness gets inherited.
//!
//! # What the Keychain buys, given that
//!
//! Not secrecy from a process running as him — nothing on a single-user Mac gives that. It
//! buys three real things: the key is not in a file he can copy to a USB stick or sync to a
//! cloud drive by accident; it is not sitting in a Time Machine backup as plaintext; and
//! **"Forget this phone" can destroy it completely**, which is what makes plan §4.1's
//! *"instant and complete by construction"* true.

///
/// The service name used to be [`SERVICE`] and nothing else, for every launch of this app on
/// this machine. A launch under a scratch `HOME` therefore wrote its test keys into the
/// **same Keychain item** the CEO's real app uses, because `/usr/bin/security` files by
/// service and account and knows nothing about `HOME`. That is exactly what happened: QA
/// fixture homes carrying a symbolic link to the host's own `Library/Keychains` ran on the
/// host through candidates `.14`–`.16`, and `add-generic-password` wrote under
/// `com.richos.app.phone-channel` — the service his real app reads. This module's own
/// doctrine (see [`SecretStore`]) already said the tests must not write to the CEO's real
/// Keychain; the rule was there and nothing enforced it.
///
/// # The rule now, and why it is this one
///
/// The service is `com.richos.app.phone-channel.<12 hex of SHA-256 of the app-data path>`. The
/// app-data directory is the one thing that is *already* different between a real launch and a
/// scratch-`HOME` launch, it is a value this process is handed rather than one it guesses, and
/// no amount of copying a fixture home changes where that copy sits. So two `HOME`s produce two
/// service names by construction, and a test cannot collide with his item even by accident.
///
/// **The path is used as it is given, and deliberately not canonicalized.** Canonicalizing
/// fails on a directory that does not exist yet, which is the first launch — and a service name
/// that changed the moment the directory appeared would lose the key it had just written. The
/// app resolves this path the same way on every launch, so the name is stable.
///
/// # The migration, which is a feature here rather than a cost
///
/// No build after this one reads or writes the bare [`SERVICE`] name. Every item under it is
/// therefore PRE-FIX — which is precisely the set the QA runs above left in his login keychain.
