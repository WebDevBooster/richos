//! **THE PAIRED DEVICE, AND WHY EVERY REFUSAL IS A 404** — plan §2.5 items 4, 6 and 7, §2.7

//!
//! > *"**Every route requires the paired device's credential, and everything else is a flat
//! > 404** — the tg-bridge's `chat_id` allowlist lesson kept verbatim: an unpaired caller
//! > learns nothing, not even that it guessed a real path."*
//!
//! > *"**What is on his Wi-Fi is trusted less than he thinks** — a guest's laptop, a TV, a
//! > doorbell. Being on the home network is explicitly NOT authentication here; the pairing
//! > credential is."*
//!
//! # The credential, and whose shape it is
//!
//! **RECONCILED 2026-09-18 with the landed phone app.** The phone shipped first (`dfa7ed27`)
//! with its own contract stub, and the Mac side adopts its wire shapes rather than the other
//! way round — the phone is a tested artifact and this Rust was not yet reachable from
//! anywhere, so this is the cheaper side to move. `richos/web/web-app/lib/api.js` is the
//! authority for every byte below.
//!
//! At pairing the phone generates a **non-extractable** WebCrypto ECDSA P-256 key and
//! registers the public half. Every request after that carries
//!
//! ```text
//! Authorization: RichOS-Device <device_id>.<challenge>.<base64url signature>
//! ```
//!
//! where the signature is over [`signing_string`]:
//!
//! ```text
//! <challenge>\n<METHOD>\n<path-with-query>\n<lowercase hex SHA-256 of the body, or "">
//! ```
//!
//! **The challenge is issued by the Mac and never by the phone** — `X-RichOS-Challenge` on
//! every response, in the stream's `hello`, and in the pairing answer. Plan §2.7's cheaper
//! alternative, a long random bearer token, is **not** taken: slice C did not run over, so
//! nothing extractable is stored on the phone.
//!
//! # The one property that is weaker than the word "challenge" suggests, said plainly
//!
//! **A challenge is not single-use.** It cannot be, and the reason is the client rather than a
//! shortcut: the phone replays the most recent challenge it holds, and it cannot know a newer
//! one before the response that carries it arrives — so two concurrent requests share one. And
//! `EventSource` reconnects to *the identical URL*, so the stream's credential is presented
//! again on every reconnection by the browser itself.
//!
//! So a challenge is valid for [`CHALLENGE_LIFETIME_MS`] from the moment the Mac issued it, and
//! only the most recent [`LIVE_CHALLENGES`] are live at once. What that buys: a captured
//! request is replayable for at most ten minutes, by somebody already on his home network, and
//! it can do nothing a replay of it could not — the phone's own words, again, on his own
//! thread. What it does NOT claim is one-shot freshness, and this paragraph exists so nobody
//! reads the word "challenge" and assumes it.

// =========================================================================================
// "THEY DO NOT MATCH", REMEMBERED ACROSS A RELAUNCH
// =========================================================================================
//
// **Two halves, and only one of them survived quitting the app.**
//
// The half that already survives is the REFUSAL, and it survives by construction rather than
// by a flag: `routes.rs` drops the device record synchronously before it rings the stop
// switch, [`DeviceDesk::forget`] deletes `device.json`, and
// [`DeviceDesk::listener_should_run`] reads what is on disk — so the next launch finds nothing
// paired, `PhoneRuntime::resume_if_paired` starts no socket, and the phone that said the words
// did not match is refused because there is nothing left for it to reach. That is asserted in
// this module rather than trusted: see
// `a_rejected_phone_is_still_refused_after_a_relaunch_and_the_notice_goes_with_it`.
//
// The half that did NOT survive is the SENTENCE. `PhoneStatus::rejected` was a `Mutex<bool>`
// on the runtime, seeded `false` at every `PhoneRuntime::install`, so quitting RichOS after
// refusing a phone brought the settings screen back reading as though nothing had happened —
// which is Ray's `.8` defect 1, *"he has no way to know the Mac heard him"*, one launch later.
// So the refusal is written down here, beside `device.json`, in the one directory that holds
// what this Mac remembers about phones.
//
// **The file's EXISTENCE is the fact; its contents are for a person reading it.** A record
// this build cannot parse is still a refusal — the OPPOSITE default from the device record
// above, deliberately: a damaged `device.json` must never be guessed into a paired phone, and
