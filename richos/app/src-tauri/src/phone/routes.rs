//! **THE FOUR ROUTES, AND THE FLAT 404 EVERYTHING ELSE GETS.** Plan §2.5 item 5, and the wire
//! contract `docs/architecture/phone-channel.md`.
//!
//! **RECONCILED 2026-09-18 with the landed phone app.** Every route name, header, field name and
//! status code below comes from `richos/web/web-app/lib/api.js`, which shipped first (`dfa7ed27`).
//! The phone is a tested artifact and this Rust was not yet reachable from anywhere, so this is
//! the side that moved.
//!
//! # Why this file has no socket in it
//!
//! [`dispatch`] is a pure function from a described request to a described response. The TLS
//! acceptor, the accept loop and the stream write loop are all in [`super::listen`], which calls
//! this. That split is what makes the route table testable: the whole path space — including every
//! way a caller can be refused — is exercised in this module's own tests with no listener, no
//! certificate and no port.
//!
//! # The surface, in full
//!
//! | | Route | Credential |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 1 | `POST /api/messages` | `Authorization: RichOS-Device …` |
//! | 2 | `GET /api/events` — the stream, or the backfill when `before=` is present | the same, in the query as `auth=` |
//! | 3 | `GET /api/audio/<message_id>` | `Authorization: RichOS-Device …` |
//! | 4 | `POST /api/pair` — pairing with a code, or the device record when authenticated | the code, or the signature |
//! | — | `GET /` and the static shell | none, and none is possible — see below |
//!
//! **The static shell has no credential and cannot have one.** The phone loads the app in order to
//! pair, so a lock here would be a lock whose key is behind the lock. It is safe because of what
//! those files are: the shell only, with no conversation in it. Everything with his words in it is
//! behind a signature.
