//! **THE SEAM INTO THE REST OF THE APP** — [`routes::Bridge`] implemented over the Tauri handles,
//! and the one honest limit it runs into.
//!
//! # The wall this file works around, measured
//!
//! `Spine::submit_prompt` takes `&mut self` and does not return until the turn is over, and the
//! shell holds the one `Spine` behind a `Mutex` (`main.rs`, `state.spine.lock().unwrap()`). So for
//! the whole length of a turn — the spec's own example is *"Worked for 2h 17m 50s"* — **every path
//! into the spine is blocked.**
//!
//! Two consequences, and they are handled differently because they are different problems:
//!
//! **Writing** is already solved and not by this file: the CEO's words go to the durable intake
//! log, which is reachable without the spine lock, and `Spine::poll_intake` drains it. So
//! [`PhoneBridge::submit_text`] returns in the time one `fsync` takes, and the turn itself runs on
//! a thread that is allowed to wait for the lock for as long as it needs.
//!
//! **Reading** is the one that needed a decision. A phone opening its stream while Rich is
//! mid-turn cannot be made to wait for the lock: that is an HTTP request held open for
//! potentially hours, which presents as a phone that will not start. So this file keeps **the last
//! gated payload it was able to read** and serves that when the lock is busy.
//!
//! **What that costs, stated rather than buried:** a phone whose very first connection happens
//! during a long turn, on an install that has never had one, gets a readable *"Rich is working"*
//! instead of the conversation. Every other case is covered, because the cache is primed when the
//! channel starts (he has just opened the pairing screen, so nothing is running) and refreshed
//! after every turn the channel itself starts. It is a cache of something already gated — never a
//! second source of truth, and never something the phone can disagree with the Mac about for
//! longer than one turn.
