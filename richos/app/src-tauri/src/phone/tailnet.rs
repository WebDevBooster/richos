//! **THE TAILSCALE PATH — a name the whole internet already trusts, or an honest "not yet".**
//!
//! CEO decision §61, verbatim: *"The RichOS desktop app will guide technical users (with the help
//! of crystal-clear and ultra-simple how-to screens in the app) to their Tailscale setup. That's
//! it. The Tailscale setup is where we start now."*
//!
//! The reach document's §2.3 is what this implements: *"You install Tailscale on the Mac and on
//! the phone and sign in to both with the same free account … the Mac gets a name with a
//! **publicly trusted** certificate — which would delete the sixteen taps as a side effect."*
//!
//! # This module never decides anything. It reports a state.
//!
//! Tailscale is the **user's** software, signed into the **user's** account. Every question this
//! module can ask has an answer that is not ours to change: not installed, not signed in, signed
//! in but switched off, signed in but the tailnet has not been told to issue certificates. So the
//! whole of this file is one function that turns `tailscale status --json` into one of eight
//! named states, each with a sentence HE can read. **Nothing here installs, enables, signs in or
//! retries.** §2.3's own failure mode — *"when Tailscale is off or logged out, the name stops
//! resolving including at home"* — is a state on this list, not an error.
//!
//! # What was measured, and what was NOT
//!
//! **Tailscale is not installed on this Mac.** Checked on 2026-09-18 eight ways: no
//! `/Applications/Tailscale.app`, no `tailscale` on `PATH`, nothing at `/usr/local/bin`,
//! `/opt/homebrew/bin` or inside a bundle's `Contents/MacOS`, no `~/Library/Containers/io.tailscale*`,
//! no `/var/run/tailscale*` socket, nothing in `launchctl list`, not in `brew list`, and no
//! `ts.net` resolver in `scutil --dns`. So **no output in this file was captured from a running
//! daemon**, and saying otherwise would be the exact failure the house rule about numbers is
//! about. Raised as `esc-20260918T204405Z-e25d25de`.
//!
//! What the fixtures ARE pinned to is the upstream **type declarations**, quoted verbatim from
//! `tailscale/tailscale` `main`:
//!
//! * `ipn/backend.go` — `type State int`, with `stateStrings = [...]string{"NoState",
//!   "InUseOtherUser", "NeedsLogin", "NeedsMachineAuth", "Stopped", "Starting", "Running"}`.
//!   **Seven**, and `InUseOtherUser` is the one every third-party wrapper forgets.
//! * `ipn/ipnstate/ipnstate.go` — `BackendState string` (*"is an ipn.State string value"*),
//!   `Self *PeerStatus`, and `CertDomains []string`: *"the set of DNS names for which the control
//!   plane server will assist with provisioning TLS certificates … These names are FQDNs without
//!   trailing periods."*
//! * `ipn/ipnstate/ipnstate.go` — `PeerStatus.DNSName`: *"DNSName is the Peer's FQDN. **It ends
//!   with a dot.** It has the form `host.<MagicDNSSuffix>.`"* That trailing dot is why
//!   [`origin_for`] exists rather than a `format!` at the call site.
//! * `cmd/tailscale/cli/cert.go` — `"tailscale cert [flags] <domain>"`, `--cert-file` and
//!   `--key-file` each documented as *"output cert file or `-` for stdout"*, and the two refusals
//!   this module classifies: *"HTTPS cert support is not enabled/configured for your tailnet."*
//!   and *"Tailscale is not running."*
//!
//! So the PARSER is pinned to the source of truth; the SHAPE OF A REAL RUN on this machine is
//! `unverified:` and settled by one `tailscale status --json` once it is installed. The parser is
//! deliberately written to ignore every field it was not told about, so a real daemon's much
//! larger document cannot break it by being larger.
//!
//! # Raw output is never logged, and that is borrowed rather than invented
//!
//! `richos-hq/docs/research/t3code-mobile-vs-richos-phone-2026-09-18.md` idea 7, reading T3 Code's
//! own wrapper: they classify this binary's stderr into a closed label set *"because stderr can
//! contain auth keys (`tskey-…`) and node names, and these labels are logged."* [`Diagnostic`] is
//! that closed set for us. **The raw text does not leave this module.**
