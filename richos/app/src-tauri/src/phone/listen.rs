//! **THE SOCKET — and everything about it that plan §2.5 promised in exchange for opening one.**
//!
//! > *"Bar (c) is gone, and this is **RichOS's first inbound network listener** … That is the real
//! > security cost of §57, and it is contained rather than hand-waved."*
//!
//! This file is the containment, and each item is at the line that enforces it:
//!
//!  1. **It does not exist until he pairs a phone.** [`Listener::start`] is called from the
//!     pairing surface; [`Listener`]'s `Drop` closes every socket and JOINS the thread, so "the
//!     listener stopped" means the port is free when the call returns rather than soon.
//!  2. **It binds the LAN interfaces only, never `0.0.0.0`** — every address comes from
//!     [`super::names`], which read them off this machine by name, and [`check_addresses`] refuses
//!     a wildcard and an empty list by hand.
//!  3. **TLS with our own leaf** — [`tls_config`], built from what [`super::ca`] issued.
//!  4. **Every route requires the credential, everything else is a flat 404** —
//!     [`super::routes`].
//!  6. **Body-size limits at the edge** — `Limited` fails the read rather than buffering the body
//!     and then measuring it, which is the difference between a limit and a check.
//!
//! # Why the channel owns its own runtime
//!
//! A current-thread tokio runtime on one named thread, created when the listener starts and
//! dropped when it stops. The app's own async runtime outlives the listener by design, so hanging
//! the sockets off it would make "stopped" a flag rather than an absence. This way **stopping the
//! channel destroys the thing that was listening** — item 1 stated as a fact about the process
//! rather than about a boolean. Dropping the runtime also ends every open event stream, which is
//! why the stream task does not have to watch for shutdown itself.
//!
//! # Why there is no `tokio::select!` in here
//!
//! The macro lives behind `tokio/macros`, which would add `tokio-macros` as a new package.
//! `futures_util::future::select` does the same job for the one race that needs it — one
//! `accept()` against one shutdown — and `tokio::time::timeout` does the other. An attribute is
//! not worth a `[[package]]` line.

    // THE TWO LEGS, TIMED — Ray's `.20260920.1` defect 1
    // -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    //
    // **WHAT WAS MEASURED IN THE VM, and it is the asymmetry rather than either number that
    // is the finding.** `docs/verification/2026-09-20-nightly-1.2.0-nightly.20260920.1-mac-to-
    // phone-in-the-vm-audit.md`, step 3: Rich's reply crossed from the Mac's window to the
    // phone's page in under a second on all five turns (tightest turn: the two screens within
    // 167 ms). The CEO's OWN typed message took **1.3 s to 6.1 s on four of those same five
    // turns** — same channel, same thread, same second.
    //
    // **WHAT THIS TEST CAN AND CANNOT SETTLE, said before the numbers so they are not read as
    // more than they are.** It measures the leg from the Mac's LEDGER to the bytes on the
    // phone's socket, for both directions of one turn, over real TLS through the shipped
    // listener. That is the whole of what `src/phone/` owns. It does NOT measure the leg from
    // his keypress to the ledger — that is the window, the Tauri command and the spine's one
    // mutex (`main.rs`'s `take_the_spine`), and it is measured in the VM with `RICHOS_HOP_TRACE`
    // and not here. So a GREEN run here does not say "the defect is fixed"; it says the phone
    // path is not where the asymmetry is, which is a thing worth being able to prove in
    // twenty seconds rather than in a VM walk.
    //
    // **THE ONE STRUCTURAL FACT IT PINS**, which is what makes it a regression test rather than
    // a benchmark: his message and Rich's reply leave the Mac through the SAME
    // `LiveObserver` -> `PhoneHub::publish` -> one open SSE socket (`stream.rs`), so no future
    // version can quietly put his own words on a poll, a batch or a refresh-after-the-reply
    // without this failing. That is exactly the shape the fix for
    // `esc-20260919T003541Z-6885f74b` removed, and nothing until now would have noticed it
    // coming back.

    // pressing `They do not match` on the phone dropped the device record and left the Mac
    // answering on 8443 at t+10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 s, and two minutes later. The route had
    // `channel.devices` and no handle on the listener at all.
    //
    // **What is real here and what is not**, so the coverage claim is honest:
    //
    //   * REAL certificate authority and leaf, a REAL `rustls` client validating one against the
    //     other, the REAL `hyper` listener on a real socket, the REAL route table and the REAL
    //     signature check — the rejection arrives the way a phone sends it;
    //   * REAL `phone::watch_for_rejection`, the shipped watcher, on its own thread;
    //   * the OWNER is this test rather than `PhoneRuntime`, because building one far enough to
    //     start a channel needs a `tauri::AppHandle`, the login Keychain and a working tailnet.
    //     The owner's body here is the first two lines of `PhoneRuntime::forget`; the shipped
    //     closure calls `forget()` itself and is one line long.
    //
    // **The positive control is step 2**: the same connect, on the same port, a moment earlier,
    // succeeding. Without it a refused connection proves nothing — a listener that never started
    // refuses just as convincingly.
    //
    // **It serves the tailnet name and no other**, because that is the one path there is (CEO
