//! **OPENING ONE OF SIX KNOWN THINGS, AND NOTHING ELSE.**
//!
//! CEO §61.1, from his own evening: Tailscale's own screens never say that the account IS the
//! network, and he could not find the macOS download from `tailscale.com`'s home page or from the
//! admin console. So the how-to screens name an exact address for every step — and an address a
//! person has to retype into a browser is an address half of them will mistype.
//!
//! # Why this is an allowlist and not a URL opener
//!
//! A general "open this URL" command is a hole with a button on it: anything that can reach the
//! webview can then ask the Mac to open `file:///`, a `mailto:` that sends, a custom scheme
//! registered by some other application, or a link that looks like ours with a different host.
//! The screens need **six** destinations, all of them fixed at build time, so the command takes
//! the address as a **key into a table** rather than as data to act on. Anything not in the table
//! is refused by name.
//!
//! **The table IS the set of addresses the screens print**, and a test in this file reads
//! `ui/phone.js` and proves it: a new address in the UI that nobody allowlisted fails the suite
//! rather than silently producing a control that does nothing.
//!
//! # And the address stays written out beside the control
//!
//! Urban's §2: *"a control that opens somewhere the user cannot see first is a control that asks
//! for trust it has not earned"*. The button is the convenience; the printed address is the
//! fallback for a Mac where the opener does not work, and neither replaces the other.
