//! FIRST RUN, THE SURFACE — one consent step, then progress, then done.
//!
//! `richos_core::setup` decides and does; this file is what the window talks to. It holds no
//! decisions of its own, for the reason `memory.rs` holds none: two places that both know
//! where an engine may live is how an install succeeds and a boot then fails to find it.
//!
//! # What the CEO sees, and what he is spared
//!
//! **No terminal. No path. No version number.** One sheet naming what is about to be
//! installed and why, a button, progress while it runs, and a sentence at the end. The
//! consent copy is [`richos_core::setup::Component::why`], and a test asserts it carries no
//! slash, no dollar sign, no digit and no mention of Terminal.
//!
//! **His sentence is exempt from that floor.** Once dictation is there
//! (`richos_core::dictation_ready`), the video tools' line is the CEO's own setup sentence
//! ([`richos_core::setup::MEDIA_TOOLS_WHY`], "private/local", "$140+/year"), used exactly as he
//! wrote it.
//!
//! **And it does not imply zero-touch.** RichOS is BYO-Anthropic: `open-items.md` row 3.14
//! lists it as the second of the three things to settle — *"D removes one setup step of two,
//! not all of them — RichOS is BYO-Anthropic, so the customer still needs an account and a
//! login, and D must not be sold to him as zero-touch."* [`SETUP_ACCOUNT_NOTE`] is that
//! sentence in his language, on the same sheet, before he presses anything.
//!
//! # Progress, and why it is an event rather than a return value
//!
//! Anthropic's installer downloads the `claude` binary — 197,220,928 B on a Mac with no
//! `zstd`, which macOS 15.6 does not ship (§19, finding 3). A command that returns only when
//! that finishes is a window that looks hung for minutes. Each step emits [`EVENT_SETUP`] as
//! it starts and as it ends, so the surface can say what is happening while it happens.
//!
//! # The failure contract
//!
//! Every failure is a named `SetupError`, its `Display` is written for the CEO, and the
//! `finished` event carries `machine_unchanged` so the surface can say whether anything on his
//! Mac was touched. **A step that fails stops the run**: installing an engine for a Claude that
//! is not there produces a half-set-up machine that reports two successes and works for
//! nothing, which is the failure mode this whole module exists to avoid.
