//! RELAUNCH INTO A DOWNLOADED UPDATE WHEN NOTHING IS RUNNING (CEO feedback 2026-10-06, item 1).
//!
//! His words: *"there was no work going on at the time. So, there was nothing that could be
//! interrupted. In this case, the app should automatically re-launch immediately after
//! downloading the new version. Avoiding/preventing a re-launch is only meant for when there
//! are workers running and an immediate relaunch would destroy their work."*
//!
//! WHAT "RUNNING" MEANS is not decided here. It is `updates::work_verdict`, the same gate that
//! already hides the download control: the active turn, the spine, this session's workers,
//! background work on every work lease, his team on an operator install, and commands Rich
//! started. One gate, so the relaunch and the download can never disagree about it.
//!
//! WHY A HELPER PROCESS AND NOT `AppHandle::restart`. Activation of a prepared update needs
//! the EXCLUSIVE side of the session lease at startup (`update_startup::prepare`), and every
//! running RichOS holds the shared side until its process ends. Tauri's restart SPAWNS the
//! replacement first and exits second (`tauri-2.11.5/src/process.rs:74-88`), so the
//! replacement would meet this process's shared lease, skip activation, and come back on the
//! old version. So the app quits through its own quit path (which settles every lease and
//! writes the clean-exit marker), and a small helper, this same executable started with
//! [`HELPER_ARG`], waits for that process to be gone and for the lease to be free, then
//! starts the app again. The new start activates the update exactly as an ordinary launch
//! would.
//!
//! WHERE HE LANDS. The window's position and size are recorded as it moves
//! (`remember_window_geometry`), the open conversation is the backend's `active_thread`, and
//! drafts and scroll positions are parked in the webview's storage (`main.js`). The relaunch
//! uses all three exactly as any launch does, and `updates.js` parks the view state the
//! moment the notice appears.
