//! Getting the speech model — the transport half, and it decides NOTHING.
//!
//! **THE SPLIT IS THE DESIGN.** `richos_voice::provision` holds every rule: what the bytes are,
//! whether there is room, whether to resume, whether what arrived is the model RichOS pinned, and
//! what to say when it is not. This file opens the socket, reads chunks, and asks that module
//! about everything. It is the same split `engine/voice/provisioning/model-integrity.js` and
//! `model-fetch.js` already use, and it exists for the same reason: **the failure paths have to be
//! testable without a network**, and they are — `crates/richos-voice/tests/model_provisioning.rs`
//! drives the whole state machine over synthetic bytes and opens no socket at all.
//!
//! So the rule for this file is narrow and worth keeping: **if a line here decides something, it
//! is in the wrong file.**
//!
//! # `reqwest`, and why it is not a new dependency
//!
//! `reqwest 0.13.4` is already in `src-tauri/Cargo.lock`, arriving beneath `tauri-plugin-updater`
//! — which is how the CEO's own app already downloads its updates. Naming it directly downloads no
//! new crate; the `Cargo.lock` diff for this change is the proof and it adds no `[[package]]`.
//! This is the same argument this manifest already makes for `tokio` ("Already in the tree beneath
//! `tauri`… so no new download"), and the reason it is stated rather than assumed is the CEO's
//! standing rule about third-party defaults: nothing here rides on `reqwest`'s behavior being
//! sensible, because every byte it returns is checked against a pinned sha256 before it is
//! allowed to become a model.
//!
//! # What this file will not do
//!
//! - **No daemon, no scheduler, no background retry.** A download happens because the CEO asked
//!   for it, in the foreground, and stops when it stops.
//! - **No automatic retry of a corrupted download.** `Finding::retryable` decides, and it says no
//!   to a hash mismatch: retrying corruption in a loop is how a transient fault becomes a support
//!   conversation.
//! - **No binary, ever.** RichOS fetches pinned WEIGHTS. `whisper-cli` is not pinned and cannot be
//!   (`model-pins.json`: a Homebrew binary's sha256 is a property of an arch and a bottle
//!   revision), so a machine with no decoder is told so and offered nothing.

// THE THREE SENTENCES FOR A GAP RICHOS CANNOT CLOSE.
//
// CONSTANTS, AND THE FORM IS LOAD-BEARING. `ui/tests/lib/state-strings.js` derives the
// inventory of everything the CEO can read by scanning a Rust literal's own line plus the two
// above it for `Err(`, `ok_or`, `.into()` or a `const … : &str =`. Written inline inside an
// `unwrap_or_else(|| { … })` these sentences fell OUTSIDE that window — the `.into()` landed on
// the line below the literal — so they became invisible to the affordance rule while remaining
// perfectly visible to the CEO. A sentence the rule cannot see is a sentence that can quietly
// become an instruction with no control beside it.
//
// So they are `const … : &str =` items with the literal starting on the same line, which is the
// shape that scrape explicitly supports, and each is classified in
// `ui/tests/lib/state-registry.js`. Naming them also matches what `main.rs` already does with
// `LEASE_UNAVAILABLE_MESSAGE`.
//
// EVERY ONE NAMES THE PARTY. These are states the CEO cannot fix, and the affordance rule's
// NEEDS-SOMEONE-ELSE clause requires the sentence to say who can — "aren't installed yet"
// implies somebody will and never says who, leaving a reader who cannot install anything
// holding a job with no owner. `SttError::ceo_message` set that precedent and these follow it.
