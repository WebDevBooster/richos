//! **The app's side of dictation** (plan section 1 and section 6): starting the dictation tool
//! as this app's child, the socket client, the voice-mode yield and `finish`.
//!
//! The app is RichOS exactly as it is today. It starts, counts its starts and shows its splash
//! as before; nothing here touches its lifecycle, its launch record, its activation rule, its
//! window counting or its updater. In slices 1 to 4 the tool is always this app's child: it
//! inherits this app's environment and data folder and ends within a second of this app ending.
//!
//! **Dictation and voice mode never listen at once** (plan section 2). When the tool starts
//! listening it says `will-listen`, and an app in voice mode ends it, discarding the utterance in
//! progress: never sent as a turn. When the talk button is pressed while a dictation listens, the
//! app says `finish` first, and voice mode listens once the dictation is being written.
//!
//! **The Dictation sheet and the Settings row** (slice 2, plan section 2 rows 5 to 12, section
//! 4): the [`Host`] writes `dictation.json` (the app is its only writer), starts and stops the
//! tool with the switch, asks macOS for the two permissions in the drawn order (the microphone,
//! then Accessibility), tells the tool to make its key tap the moment Accessibility is allowed,
//! and asks the tool's tap for the next key ("Press a different key"). The words are the
//! window's (`ui/dictation.js`, round 19); [`view_of`] decides the facts they are drawn from.
//!
//! **The login start** (slice 5, `dictation/login.rs`): in an installed copy on the account's
//! real home the tool is launchd's, registered as a LaunchAgent when the switch goes on (and
//! again at each app start while it is on), unregistered when it goes off; it outlives the app.
//! Anywhere else (a folder copy, an older macOS) the tool stays this app's child.
//!
//! **A copy that does not own the key** (review finding 4, 2026-10-08) changes the owner's
//! settings through the tool (`change`), never its own file, and shows the key and accuracy the
//! tool reports. **A tool that goes away** (finding 5) is started again, or reconnected to, with
//! a bound on how often. **The microphone handover is answered** (finding 2): `will-listen` is
//! acknowledged with `voice-yielded` once voice mode is closed, and `finish` refuses to open
//! voice mode while a dictation still listens.
//!
//! **The test switch stays** for the walks: `RICHOS_DICTATION_TEST_ON` set to `1` or `0` in the
//! app's environment writes `on` into `dictation.json` at start.
