///
/// **What that does NOT do, so this doc never has to be corrected a second time.** It does not

// measured exactly one lock take: [`send_message`]'s. Ray's candidate-.12 re-walk then found
// "On it!" on the real window at **14.24 s** with the turn's own header reading **"Working for
// 8s"** (`docs/verification/2026-09-19-nightly-1.2.0-nightly.20260919.1-mac-and-android-rewalk-audit.md`
// §2), so about six seconds were spent BEFORE the turn's clock started — and this log line
// never printed, because by the time `send_message` asked for the mutex it was free. The wait
// had been paid in full by the bridge calls the window makes IN FRONT of the Send
// (`ui/main.js`'s `send()` on a brand-new thread: `create_thread_in`, `navigation_tree`,
// `switch_thread`, `active_context`, `techy_mode`, `get_timeline`, `onboarding_view`,
// `take_work_notices`), not one of which measured anything at all.
//
// So the measurement moved from ONE call site to the LOCK — the only thing all of them have in
// common — and the site is named by `#[track_caller]` rather than typed, so a hop added later
// is measured without anybody remembering to measure it. That is the hand-maintained-inventory

    // crossed in under a second
    // (`docs/verification/2026-09-20-nightly-1.2.0-nightly.20260920.1-mac-to-phone-in-the-vm-audit.md`,
    // step 3). Two legs of one turn, so it was never the network.
    //
    // **THE CAUSE, MEASURED RATHER THAN REASONED** (`phone::listen`'s two timing tests, over
    // real TLS through the shipped listener):
    //
    //   * his row and Rich's reply leave the Mac on ONE path, and it costs **5 ms**;
    //   * with the spine held for 1,500 ms, that same 5 ms leg becomes **1,507 ms**.
    //
    // His sentence cannot reach a phone until it reaches the ledger, and it cannot reach the
    // ledger until this function owns the spine: `Ledger::record_prompt_received` is
    // `&mut self` over in-memory projections. Meanwhile `ui/main.js` has ALREADY painted his
    // bubble from its own model (`:1814-1821`, before it calls this command at `:1824`), so
    // the wait is invisible on the Mac and is the whole of what the phone shows. The biggest
    // holder of that mutex is an ordinary turn, which this function keeps holding well past
    // the moment the window is told the turn is over and the composer goes live again.
    //
    // **So his words stop waiting for the spine at all.** They go to the durable intake log —
    // one `fsync`, no lock, the road the PHONE's own messages have taken since `bridge.rs` —
    // and the spine picks them up with `poll_intake` below, in order, through the same
    // `accept_prompt` the direct road uses (`spine.rs`'s `IntakeRecord::Desk` arm). Nothing
    // about the turn changes; only WHEN his sentence becomes a durable fact.
    //
    // **AND IT IS ONLY TAKEN WHEN NOTHING CAN REFUSE HIM.** Every refusal below hinges on
    // `spine.has_lease()`, and `control.lease_session()` answers that question WITHOUT the
    // lock. With no lease session this falls through to the old road untouched, so the
    // first-run sentences Ray fought for in candidate .15 are reached exactly as before — and

// =====================================================================================
// ENTITY + THREAD NAVIGATION — appended block (Codex-UX slice 4, 2026-08-29)
//
// `docs/design/richos-codex-inspired-conversation-ux-2026-08-28.md` §3 (left navigation),
// §25 (Navigation acceptance criteria).
//
// THE POINT OF THIS BLOCK, in one sentence: grouping is done HERE, by the authority that
// owns the binding, and never by the renderer filtering a flat list.
//
// §1 says an entity is *"also a hard scope and privacy boundary"*, and the brief for this
// slice is explicit that selecting an entity must actually scope what follows rather than
// filter a list on screen. A renderer that receives every thread and sorts them into
// buckets by an `entity_id` string is one `if` away from putting a thread in the wrong
// bucket, and nothing would catch it. So `navigation_tree` resolves each thread through
// the ledger's immutable binding and emits threads already inside their entity's group. A
// thread whose binding cannot be produced is not placed anywhere: it goes to `unbound`,
// which is a separate list and not an entity.
//
// Everything below is APPEND-ONLY — nothing above is reordered or edited except four
// mechanical seams (the `mod nav;` line, the `nav` field on `AppState`, its construction
// in `setup`, and the command names at the END of `generate_handler!`).

// typed something first — measured cell D1. A person who opens RichOS, looks at the screen
// and types nothing is told nothing at all, and the screen he lands on is an empty
// conversation.
//
// WHY TWO COMMANDS AND NOT ONE. `onboarding_view` reads and `decline_onboarding` writes,
// and the read is DERIVED from the same two facts on disk that the priming block is derived
// from — so the notice on screen and the block in the priming turn cannot disagree about
// whether he has been asked. There is no third command and no state that says "the notice
// was shown": `onboarding.rs`'s module doc bans it by name, because a flag recording that
// the app SHOWED something is exactly the failure this whole line of work exists to remove.
//
// WHY THE WRITE HAS TO EXIST AT ALL. `OnboardingRecord::record_declination` shipped with no
// caller anywhere in the product, so `OnboardingState::Declined` and `DECLINED_BLOCK` were
// unreachable outside their own tests and "not now" could only ever be said into a

// installer, no first-run flow, nothing in the product creates it.
//
// HIS PART IS ONE CLICK AND NO PATH. `memory_status` carries `offered_location`
// (`~/RichOS/corpus`, pre-filled), the window renders it as a sentence with a button, and
// `provision_memory` takes the target it is GIVEN. There is no branch anywhere below that

    //! ```text
    //! [richos] first-run setup: the RichOS engine is NOT installed — 3 place(s) looked:
    //! [richos]   looked in …/RichOS/engine — the engine there carries the right version and
    //!                      different contents — installed from 3313945b26b7, and this build

    //! try."* Asking again could not work — nothing about that machine changes by being asked
    //! twice — and the one press that fixes it was never offered.
    //!
    //! This is the DECISION the gate makes, exercised against a real directory on disk: the

// THE LAUNCH RECORD — the shell's half
//
// CEO ruling 2026-08-31 (`richos-hq/wiki/gamification.md` § "Splash tracking"). The model
// itself, and every word of why, is in `richos_core::launch`; this layer does three things
// and nothing else: it tells the webview what kind of start this is BEFORE the opening
// screen decides whether to draw, it hands the record's contents to a caller that asks, and
// it takes the id of a splash that was actually shown.
//
// NOTHING HERE IS ON THE LAUNCH PATH. The classification and the window are built in
// `setup()` above (see the block comment there); the two commands below are called after
// the app is usable, from the same "dead last on purpose" tail of `main.js` that already
// carries the splash's other bookkeeping.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// The one line injected into every window before any of its own scripts run.
///
/// A literal object, not a command the page has to call: `splash.js` runs synchronously at
/// the top of `<body>` and cannot await anything, and a splash that appeared on a
/// crash-restart because the answer arrived a tick late would be exactly the wrong ceremony
/// at exactly the wrong moment.
///
/// `Object.freeze` because this is a statement of fact about how the app started, and a
/// later script that could edit it could make a crash-restart claim to be a fresh launch.
///
/// `ordinal` is WHICH START THIS IS, 1-based, and the CEO's v1 splash rule is a table over
/// it: first start shows #1, second shows #2, third and after show #1. It rides here for
/// exactly the same reason `kind` does — `splash.js` chooses on its first synchronous line
/// and cannot await a command — and it is `null` rather than a guess whenever
/// `LaunchStore::start_ordinal` could not honestly name one.
/// THE ONLY QUESTION THIS SHELL ASKS THE MACHINE — what displays are attached, and how much
/// of each one a window may actually occupy.
///
/// `Monitor::work_area()` is the whole reason this is three lines rather than a research
/// project: on macOS it is `NSScreen.visibleFrame`
/// (`tauri-runtime-wry-2.11.4/src/monitor/macos.rs:6-34`), so the menu bar and the Dock are
/// already subtracted by AppKit and nothing here has to model either. When AppKit cannot
/// hand back an `NSScreen` that same code degrades to the display's full frame, which is why
/// `window_geometry` keeps its own edge margin on top: the work area is not guaranteed to
/// have anything taken off it.
///
/// A FAILURE HERE IS NOT FATAL AND IS NOT SILENT. An empty list is a real answer —

/// with the platform left to center it, which is worse than a derived window and far better

// THE HOME SCREEN'S ENTITY ROW (CEO, 2026-09-01)
//
// His words, in the order he gave them:
//
//   "At the very top there should be a slim row with buttons named after the user's
//    entities/companies. For RichOS v1 those buttons don't need to do anything. But
//    eventually the user should be able to 'switch' their loro visual from all companies
//    (which is default) to display the loro for just one of their companies."
//
//   "the company buttons should only appear if the user has more than one company. Not if
//    there's only one. And the user should also be able to customize in the settings the
//    labels on those company buttons and well as which to display on their home screen.
//    So, if the user wanted to anonymize their home screen (for sharing on social media),
//    they could change the label buttons to something like '1', '2', '3' etc."
//
// THREE PROPERTIES THIS LAYER HAS AND MUST KEEP:
//
//   1. **The names come from the REGISTRY.** `EntityRegistry::ceos_companies()` through the
//      spine, in registry order, never filtered and never re-sorted — the same source the
//      company picker reads. A list typed into the UI would be wrong the day he adds a
//      company, and `richos` is ONE entity with two roots, which only the registry knows.
//   2. **A label is a MASK, never a rename.** `id` on the wire is always the registry's id;
//      `label` is what the button says. Nothing downstream keys on `label`, and
//      `config.rs`'s own test `a_label_is_a_mask_and_never_a_rename` is what holds that.
//   3. **An absent override is the registry's display name.** Never blank, never the raw id.
//      That is decided HERE, in `resolve`, so no surface can get it wrong on its own.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: any effect on the picture. He was explicit that the buttons
// do nothing in v1, and filtering the field by entity is later work. What IS real is the
// label and the visibility, because those are what he would use before the filtering exists.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// must not do just as precisely. Both halves are kept here because both are load-bearing.

/// **COMPILE THE CUSTOMER'S OWN MEMORY INTO THE FIELD'S STRUCTURE, OR SAY THAT THERE IS NONE.**
///
/// # What it answers
///
/// `{ "available": true, "field": { meta, nodes, links, sources, ... } }` when a corpus
/// resolved and the compiler produced something, and
/// `{ "available": false, "reason": "<one sentence>" }` in every other case. It is not
/// `Result`, and that is deliberate: **no corpus is not an error.** It is the ordinary state
/// of a fresh install, the home screen keeps drawing the demonstration, and a rejected
/// promise would put a failure in the console for a launch in which nothing failed.
///
/// # WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DECIDE
///
/// Whether the picture it returns should replace the demonstration. It reports
/// `meta.counts.records` beside `meta.counts.objects` and stops. The CEO's instruction for
/// this work is *"The demo is definitely needed, initially, for the user"*, and the design of
/// a handover is `richos-hq/design/mockups/rounds/round-11.4`, which is unruled. The
/// preference lives in exactly one place — `home.js`'s `HOME_FIELD_MIN_OBJECTS` — and its
/// default keeps the demonstration.
///
/// # AND IT IS NOT GATED ON `memory_status`
///
/// `home.js` says why, and it is the whole reason this command exists rather than a boolean:
/// *"A provisioned corpus is not the same fact as a drawn picture, and a banner that vanished
/// the moment a customer created a folder would be claiming his data was on screen while
/// 7,500 synthetic objects were still on it."* So this compiles, and answers with what it
/// compiled. A corpus that resolves and then produces nothing is `available: false`.
///
/// # It does not take the spine's lock
///
/// `send_message` holds that mutex for the whole of a turn. The corpus is reached through
/// `AppState::loro_install` — the SAME `LoroInstall` `wire_company_memory` built the reader
/// and the writer from, carried rather than resolved a second time — so the home screen draws
/// while Rich is mid-turn, exactly as the correction desk and the stop control do.
///
/// `(async)` because it spawns one `node` per company: 6 compiles, 2.795 s wall clock,
/// measured against the CEO's own corpus on 2026-09-06. That must never run on the IPC
/// thread, and it is never on the boot path either — `home.js` calls it from an idle
/// callback with the demonstration already on the screen.
