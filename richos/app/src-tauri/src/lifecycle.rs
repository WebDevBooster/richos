//! **CLOSING THE WINDOW STOPS MEANING QUIT** — row 5 of the CEO's nine, and the decision
//! behind every exit this app can be asked for.
//!
//! His words (`richos-hq/wiki/ceo-decisions.md` §50): *"OK, window-closed only."* Row 5:
//! *"You close the window. The work keeps going. Quit ends it."*
//!
//! # What this file is, and what it is deliberately not
//!
//! It is the DECISION and the WORDS, with no Tauri in it. The wiring — the `ExitRequested`
//! arm, the Quit menu item, the Dock-icon reopen — is `main.rs`, because that is where the
//! runtime is. The split is the same one `work_gate.rs` argues for itself: a decision made
//! inside the shell is a decision no suite can drive, and this one has five branches and a
//! sentence the CEO hears.
//!
//! # The mechanism, re-derived at this base rather than quoted
//!
//! The background-work spec §2.3 says the app has no exit arm at all, and that was still
//! true at `eef1580b`:
//!
//! ```text
//! grep -rnE "prevent_exit|prevent_close|ExitRequested|RunEvent::Exit|CloseRequested" \
//!   richos/app/src-tauri/src --include=*.rs
//!   main.rs:2421  (a comment naming RunEvent::Exit)
//!   main.rs:2430  if let tauri::RunEvent::Exit = event {
//!   main.rs:6264  | tauri::WindowEvent::CloseRequested { .. }     (a geometry nudge)
//! ```
//!
//! Three hits, none of them a prevent. So the last window destroyed ended the process, and
//! the process ending killed the work within about a tenth of a second (`main.rs`'s Exit arm
//! → `shutdown_lease()` → `process_fence.kill()` → the provider group).
//!
//! **The two events this build now answers, verified in the runtime it ships against**
//! (`tauri-runtime-wry-2.11.4`, the version in `src-tauri/Cargo.lock` under `tauri 2.11.5`):
//!
//! | Event | Raised when | Read at |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `ExitRequested { code: None }` | the LAST window was destroyed | `lib.rs:4307-4326` |
//! | `ExitRequested { code: Some(_) }` | `app.exit(code)` — `Message::RequestExit` | `lib.rs:4353-4366` |
//! | `Reopen { has_visible_windows }` | the Dock icon was clicked | `lib.rs:4391-4394` |
//!
//! **The answer is read SYNCHRONOUSLY**, with `try_recv` and not `recv` (`lib.rs:4318`,
//! `:4361`), so an empty channel is not `Prevent` — §2.5a's point exactly: a handler that
//! returns before deciding, because it is waiting for a dialog, exits. Everything in this
//! file is therefore a pure function that answers immediately; the asking happens afterwards.
//!
//! # And one correction to §2.5, found by reading the runtime rather than the app
//!
//! §2.5 says *"the app builds no menu … so it inherits AppKit's, whose Quit calls
//! `terminate:` directly."* The app builds no menu — true, and still true at this base — but
//! it does not inherit AppKit's: **Tauri installs `Menu::default` for it**
//! (`tauri-2.11.5/src/app.rs:2244-2249`, guarded by `enable_macos_default_menu`, which
//! defaults to `true` at `:1620`). The conclusion is unchanged and the reason is one level
//! down: that default menu's Quit is `PredefinedMenuItem::quit`
//! (`tauri-2.11.5/src/menu/menu.rs:194`), and muda maps it to `sel!(terminate:)`
//! (`muda-0.19.3/src/platform_impl/macos/mod.rs:994`) — a selector no handler can refuse. So
//! the app must own that one item, which is what `main.rs` now does.
