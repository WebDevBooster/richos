//! **REACHING A FILE A THREAD PRODUCED, SAFELY** — the file commands and the preview scheme of
//! the Output side panel (richos-hq `docs/prds/2026-10-05-output-side-panel.md` §5, slice S3,
//! §12.3).
//!
//! The record (`richos-core/src/output.rs`, slices S1 and S2) says which files a thread
//! produced. This file is the only way the page reaches one of them: list it, describe it,
//! preview it, open it, show it in Finder, and serve its bytes to an `<img>`, `<video>`,
//! `<audio>` or `<iframe>` through `richos-output://<output id>`.
//!
//! # The one rule: an output id, never a path (§5.1)
//!
//! Every command and the scheme take an OUTPUT ID and resolve it inside Rust, against the record
//! of the thread the shell says is active — never a thread or a path the page names
//! ([`OutputFiles::locate`]). An id the record does not hold is *"I don't have that file in this
//! thread's output."* This is `mac_attachments.rs`'s rule applied again: the shelf of paths is
//! the shell's, the page holds handles. `list_output` is the one command that names a thread,
//! because it is how the page learns the ids; it hands out ids and paths, and the paths are
//! already the panel's to show (§6.3).
//!
//! # The checks, in order, before any read or action (§5.2)
//!
//! 1. The id is in the active thread's record.
//! 2. `lstat` the recorded path: a symbolic link is refused outright, and so is anything that
//!    is not a regular file (a folder, a socket, a FIFO).
//! 3. `canonicalize(path)` equals the canonical path recorded when it was witnessed; a mismatch
//!    means something was swapped in under the recorded path (a parent folder replaced by a
//!    link) and is refused with the link sentence.
//! 4. The size against the kind's preview cap (§7): over it is a state, not an error.
//! 5. Every read is an `O_NOFOLLOW` open of the canonical path.
//!
//! *Show in Finder still works* on a link or a swapped file (§6.7): it only selects what is at
//! the recorded path, and opens nothing.
//!
//! # What is here, and what is not
//!
//! Here: `list_output`, `output_file` (with the Launch Services app list), `output_preview`
//! (capped text, a parsed CSV, image header dimensions, a QuickLook rendition with its seven-day
//! cache sweep, scheme URLs for media and PDF), `output_open`, `output_reveal`, the
//! `richos-output` scheme with `Range`, and (slice S6, §12.6) `output_save_copy`. Not here,
//! because their slices name them: *Add to chat* (S7, `mac_attachments.rs`) and the split
//! width (S9, `nav.rs`). `capabilities/default.json` is unchanged: app commands need no
//! capability.
//!
//! # The save sheet is Rust's, never the page's (§5.4)
//!
//! *Save a copy…* shows the system save sheet through `tauri-plugin-dialog`, Tauri's own
//! plugin, run from Rust inside `output_save_copy`. Its commands are **not** granted in
//! `capabilities/default.json` — the updater's posture — so the page can ask for a copy of a
//! RECORDED file and nothing else: it cannot open a picker, choose a path or name one. A test
//! in this file reads the capability files and fails if any of them grants `dialog:`.
//!
//! Said, not hidden: registering the plugin also injects its `init-iife.js` into the webview,
//! which replaces `window.alert` and `window.confirm` with calls to `plugin:dialog|message` and
//! `plugin:dialog|confirm`. Ungranted, those calls are refused, so an `alert()` or `confirm()`
//! in the page would silently do nothing. No shipped UI file calls either (the same test
//! checks), and `window.prompt` — which the rail's rename uses — is not replaced.
//!
//! # Said, not hidden
//!
//! - The checks and the act are two steps: a file swapped in the instant between them is
//!   handed to `/usr/bin/open` or `qlmanage` by its canonical path. Reads here close that gap
//!   with `O_NOFOLLOW`; the two tools do not offer one. One user, one Mac (§5.5).
//! - A file whose path did not exist when it was witnessed has no recorded canonical form, so
//!   step 3 has nothing to compare and is skipped for it; steps 2 and 5 still hold.
