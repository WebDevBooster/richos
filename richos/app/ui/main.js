// does exactly what it says. What was NOT correct is what came after: `init()` made five more
// bridge calls and then opened the thread the LAST session had ended on, over the top of the
// one the CEO had just asked for, with no error and no sign that anything had been refused.
//
// MEASURED 2026-09-06 on this file at `041eee8`, WebKit, mock bridge, one uniform latency per
// bridge call. `init()` reaches the rail on its 7th call and its landing branch 5 calls later;
// a press is overwritten when its own two-call chain (`switch_thread`, `active_context`) cannot
// land before that branch — i.e. between 3 and 5 call-times after the row appears:
//
//     lag    predicted wrong window     measured wrong (click N ms after the row exists)
//     120ms  [3x120, 5x120) = 360-600   350, 400, 450, 500, 550     (ok at 300 and 600)
//     400ms  [3x400, 5x400) = 1200-2000 1200, 1600                  (ok at 800 and 2000)
//
// At 120 ms — an ordinary machine, not a pathological one — pressing "hiring" landed the CEO on
// "general": Harbor Analytics, "Running", zero turns, under a rail row he never pressed.
//
// THE FIX IS NOT A SHORTER WINDOW, IT IS NO WINDOW. Two counters, both taken synchronously, so
// no interleaving of the awaits can produce a different answer:
//
//   * `handNavigations` — a thread the CEO ASKED for. `init()`'s landing branch is a RESTORE of
//     where the last session ended, and a restore is lower authority than a live instruction:
//     if he has chosen, the restore does not run at all, so nothing is opened over his choice
//     and no `switch_thread` for the old thread is issued behind it either.
//   * `navTicket` — every `openThread` takes one before its first `await` and abandons itself
//     after every `await` if a newer one has started. This is what stops "whichever chain
//     finishes last wins", which is the same defect between two presses as it is between a
//     press and the boot.
//
// WHY HONOR THE PRESS RATHER THAN DISARM THE ROW UNTIL BOOT ENDS. A row that is painted, named,
// and carrying a handler which works is not a placeholder — disarming it would be a control that
// looks pressable and is not, which is the same family of defect one level along, and it would

//   1. GROUPING IS NOT DONE HERE. `navigation_tree` (src-tauri/src/main.rs) returns threads
//      already inside their entity's group, resolved through `Ledger::thread_binding` — the
//      accessor that reads the immutable durable record. This file renders the groups it is
//      given. It never sorts a flat list into buckets by an entity id, because an entity is
//      a privacy boundary (§1) and a bucketing bug here would be a boundary violation with
//      nothing to catch it.
//
//   2. A STATUS GLYPH REQUIRES A LIVE SIGNAL. §22 names active worker count, worker waiting
//      state and completion state as things that must not be faked. Every mark this rail
//      can draw is listed in STATUS_MARKS below with the exact signal that produces it; the
//      §3.2 states with no signal in the build today (Queued, Waiting for CEO) are absent
//      rather than approximated.

  // The cause is two lines of this file rather than anything in the renderer. `send()`'s
  // `draftEntityId` branch puts a DISPOSABLE bubble in a throwaway model, then awaits

  // draws the greeting. The 4.6 s width is the awaits still ahead of that return
  // (`renderFirstRunNotice` takes the spine's lock, which the pre-prime holds for a model turn).

  // done · 1 I can't see` as ABSENT at the shutter and PRESENT 1.6 s later.
  //
  // ONE AWAITED CALL, AND IT IS BOUNDED BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by hope. Every command it
  // issues is non-blocking on the spine BY DESIGN, so it cannot hold `renderFirstRunNotice()`
  // below behind a model turn: `get_worker_status` reads `TurnControl` and never the spine
  // (`src-tauri/src/main.rs:3388-3399` — "Taking the spine lock here would make the worker chip
  // block until Rich finished"), and `get_work_status` and `get_assignments` take the spine
  // with `try_lock` and answer in a sentence rather than waiting (`main.rs:3411`, `main.rs:3557`).
  // Three non-blocking round trips, never a turn.
  //
  // AWAITED rather than fired and forgotten, because `openThread` is what every caller and
  // every driver awaits: awaiting it here makes "the thread is open" and "the chip is right"
  // the same instant instead of two instants a scheduler apart. It carries its own
  // `workStatusRead` ticket, so a second switch landing mid-flight still discards the older
  // answer.
  //

//      rather than masking them, so this file is never handed a raw command to leak.
//   2. the seven additive `rich://` events (app/STREAMING.md). Every payload carries the ECS
//      fence and a `visibility` that is always `"ceo"` on this family.
//
// The four original events (`turn-started` / `chunk` / `turn-completed` / `turn-error`) are

    //   1. THE SURFACE IS WRONG. Until `openThread` runs he is looking at the entity's
    //      new-thread screen; `#messages` is hidden, so a bubble put there is invisible.
    //      So the conversation surface is shown FIRST, which is where the sentence is
    //      about to live anyway.
    //   2. THE MODEL IS REPLACED. `openThread` builds a fresh model (one thread, one
    //      model) and `applySnapshot` clears `items` and `pendingUser` wholesale, so any
    //      bubble added before it is destroyed by it. This one is therefore deliberately
    //      DISPOSABLE — it lives in a throwaway model for the seconds before the thread
    //      exists, and the real §25 bubble is added to the real model below, exactly as it
    //      always was. Nothing here changes what a live turn renders.
    //
    // The throwaway model is UNBOUND, and that is what makes it inert: `accepts()` refuses
    // every payload while `model.threadId == null`, so no `rich://` event for any other
    // thread can reach it, adopt it or write into it.
    //
    // The one guard this moves past: `openThread` returns early when the thread asked for
    // is already active AND the view is already `conversation`. The view is now
    // `conversation` when it reaches there, so only the first half is left holding it —
    // and `newId` is a thread `create_thread_in` has just minted, so it cannot be the
    // active one. The early return stays unreachable on this path.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE WAITING STATE — what the CEO sees while a turn runs and nothing has come back
// (the first outside user's report, 2026-09-06)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// HIS WORDS: *"it takes a lot of time to get a reply, a lot of spinning wheels waiting …
// no interaction of feedback, so it looks like a crashed application."*
//
// MEASURED FIRST, WRITTEN SECOND. A 60-second turn was driven under WebKit against this
// renderer with `send_message` never returning and the spine's own `queued -> working`
// events on the wire; the driver, the frames and the frame-by-frame reading are committed
// at `docs/verification/waiting-state-2026-09-06/`. At 2s, 10s, 30s and 60s the only thing
// on the entire screen saying the app was alive was the timeline's duration row —
// `Working for 58s`, 14px, in the top-left corner of an otherwise empty 400px region — plus
// a 5px dot beside it. The four frames were otherwise identical.
//
// So the app was never silent by design. It was quiet in a place nobody was looking, and
// its one moving mark failed the 3:1 non-text floor for part of its cycle in dark mode and
// for ALL of it in light (`.tl-pulse`; the arithmetic is beside the fix in style.css).
//
// THE RULE THIS BAND IS BUILT ON: EVERY MOVING THING IN IT IS A FACT
// =================================================================
// The clock moves because time passes. The mark flashes because a signal arrived. Nothing
// loops on a timer pretending to be work — a spinner that keeps spinning after the process
// dies is precisely the lie that produced the report above, and this band is incapable of
// it: with no events arriving the mark goes STILL and the band starts counting the silence
// out loud.
//
// Three inputs, all observed rather than inferred:
//
//   1. `status` and `startedAt`, from `rich://turn-status` — which the spine emits from the
//      ledger's own transitions and reads back OUT of the ledger before emitting
//      (`spine.rs` `turn_status_event`), so the wire cannot report a span the ledger does
//      not hold.
//   2. THE LAST SIGNAL and its wall-clock instant. A "signal" is any §13 event the TIMELINE
//      ITSELF ACCEPTED for the thread on screen — the fence has already refused everything
//      else, so this can never count another thread's traffic as this turn's progress.
//   3. What that signal WAS. An activity row contributes the backend's own `summary`,
//      relayed verbatim and never composed here. Text contributes the fact that text is
//      arriving, and nothing beyond it.
//
// NO PERCENTAGE, NO STEP COUNT, NO ESTIMATE, NO INVENTED STEP NAME. There is no source for
// any of them — `docs/verification/acp-emission-probe-2026-08-28.md` §4-5 records the
// complete union of what the adapter emits, and nothing in it says how much of a turn is
// done. When the app does not know what is happening it says how long it has been waiting,
// which is true.
//
// THE LONGEST SILENCE HAS A NAME NOW, AND IT IS STILL INPUT 3
// ==========================================================
// A second cause of the report was measured on 2026-09-06: the child pauses mid-turn to
// compact its own context, for 38.1 to 62.0 seconds (16 boundaries), and the calm surface was
// told nothing at all — every `system` frame fell to `Visibility::Technical`. It is now an
// ordinary CEO activity row, authored in Rust and relayed here VERBATIM like every other one:
// *"Making room to keep going"* while it runs, *"Made room to keep going"* when it ends
// (`timeline.rs` `semantic_summary`, `docs/verification/compaction-notice-2026-09-06/`).
//
// Nothing in this file knows what a compaction is, and that is the point — the sentence
// arrives on `rich://activity-upserted` with a state and an instant, exactly as "Read the Q3
// board pack" does, so the rule above still holds without an exception written into it. It
// is named from the frame that ANNOUNCES it (`system/status: "compacting"`, 13ms into the
// turn) and never from the length of a silence.
//
// WHY THIS MANY SECONDS, AND WHERE THE NUMBER COMES FROM
// ======================================================
// `QUIET_AFTER_MS` is where the band stops describing the last thing it saw and starts
// naming the silence. Derived from the five committed real `claude-agent-acp` runs in
// `docs/verification/acp-emission-probe-2026-08-28/run{1..5}.raw.jsonl`, which carry an
// `atMs` on every inbound message. Gaps between consecutive inbound messages during the
// prompt phase, plus each run's `session/prompt` -> first-inbound gap, n=192:
//
//     p50 62ms   p90 894ms   p95 1119ms   p99 7090ms   max 20741ms
//     over 5s: 4     over 10s: 1     over 20s: 1
//
// A HEALTHY turn has therefore gone 20.7s with nothing observable arriving, and a threshold
// under that would call working quiet. It is a PRESENTATION threshold only: "Nothing new for
// 41s" is true at every value this constant could take, so no number here can make the band
// say something false — only something differently emphasized.
//
// Re-derive: `node docs/verification/waiting-state-2026-09-06/gaps.js`.
//
// RAISED 25000 -> 35000 ON 2026-09-06, AND THE SAMPLE ABOVE IS WHY IT HAD TO BE
// ============================================================================
// Those five runs are ACP-adapter runs of ordinary turns. They contain no compaction and no
// long tool call, so they could not see the one thing that decides this number: **the native
// wire has a 30-SECOND HEARTBEAT, and it has two of them.**
//
//   * `tool_progress`, while a tool call runs. Re-derived from the committed timings rather
//     than read off a comment (`docs/verification/native-claude-tool-status-2026-08-31/raw/`,
//     `*.timings.tsv`): run13 fires at 35.443s and 65.445s -> 30.002s; run16 at 32.962s and
//     62.963s -> 30.001s.
//   * `system/status: "compacting"`, while the child compacts its own context. Measured
//     2026-09-06 (`docs/verification/compaction-notice-2026-09-06/`): turn 3 at 5190ms and
//     35190ms, turn 4 at 52086ms and 82086ms — 30000ms exactly, twice.
//
// Both reach this band as accepted signals, so at 25000ms a perfectly healthy compaction or
// long tool call spent 5 seconds of every 30 in the ATTENTION tone saying "Nothing new for
// 25s", then snapped back when the heartbeat landed — an alarm twice a minute for work that
// was going fine, which is the same class of lie as a spinner that keeps spinning.
//
//     max known heartbeat interval 30002ms  ->  35000ms clears it by 4998ms (1.17x).
//     The previous pair was 20741ms -> 25000ms (4259ms, 1.21x), so the margin is the one
//     this band was already built with.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS, stated rather than buried: a genuinely hung turn is named 10 seconds later
// than before. It is named — the count is the same count and it never stops being true — and
// the elapsed clock beside the headline was ticking the whole time.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

const QUIET_AFTER_MS = 35000;

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE PACED BAR — a bar over a wait whose length nobody knows, and why it is not a lie
//
// The CEO asked, 2026-09-06, whether the compaction row could show a bar like the splash
// screen's. He was told a bar would have to fabricate progress, because the duration is
// unknown. He rejected that and specified the design himself:
//
//   *"It doesn't need to know. It just needs to move to almost full with the expected minimum
//    time and then stay at 'almost full' until all finished etc."*
//
// He is right, and the reason is worth stating because it is the whole honesty of the thing:
// THE BAR NEVER CLAIMS A COMPLETION IT DOES NOT HAVE. It climbs over the SHORTEST wait of its
// kind ever measured and then it stops. Reaching almost-full and holding is itself a true
// signal — this one is taking longer than the fastest case — where a bar that stalls mid-way
// looks broken and a bar that completes early lies.
//
// NOTHING IN THIS FILE KNOWS WHAT A COMPACTION IS, and that stays true. An activity row may
// arrive carrying `measuredMinMs`, the shortest wait of its kind ever measured
// (`machinery.rs` `COMPACTION_MEASURED_MIN_MS` = 38138 ms, re-derived there from 16 committed
// `compact_boundary` frames). A row that carries one gets a bar; a row that does not, does
// not. The band pieces together three observed things and invents none of them:
//
//   * WHERE IT STARTED — the row's own `startedAt`, which is the LEDGER's instant for the
//     frame that announced the wait, not this window's. So a bar drawn on a compaction the
//     window joined late is drawn where it truly is.
//   * HOW FAST — `measuredMinMs`, a measured span, used as a RATE and never shown.
//   * WHEN IT ENDED — the row's own `completed`/`failed` state, off the wire. Never a timer,
//     never an inference from the clock running out.
//
// THE THREE THINGS IT REFUSES TO DO
// =================================
//   1. IT NEVER COMPLETES ON TIME PASSING. At `measuredMinMs` it stops at PACE_ALMOST and
//      holds, still, for as long as the wait lasts — 24 more seconds at the longest boundary
//      ever measured (62029 ms). Only a frame off the wire fills it.
//   2. IT NEVER OUTLIVES WHAT IT IS PACING. The bar is drawn only while the band is
//      DESCRIBING that row: the instant another signal takes over the sentence, or the band
//      goes quiet (QUIET_AFTER_MS with nothing arriving — a child that dies mid-compaction),
//      the bar goes with the description. `compaction-notice.js` fixed the truth for the
//      sentence; the bar obeys that one rather than a second one of its own. A bar left
//      sitting at almost-full over a dead child would be exactly the spinner-that-keeps-
//      spinning this whole band exists to remove.
//   3. IT NEVER PUBLISHES A NUMBER. No percentage, no countdown, no `aria-valuenow` — the
//      element is `aria-hidden`, like the mark. A `role="progressbar"` owes a value, and any
//      value it could carry would be a proportion of a span that is not this wait's.
//
// THE CURVE is the splash bar's, because the CEO named the splash bar: mostly linear with one
// gentle surge early that fades out (`splash.js` BAR_SURGE = 0.12), and deliberately NOT an
// ease-out, since the classic "stuck at 95%" feeling IS an ease-out. What was NOT borrowed is
// the mechanism: the splash bar knows its own hold and lands at 100% exactly when the curtain
// lifts. This one does not know when it ends, which is the entire problem, and is why it
// holds instead of landing.

  // `running` now means what it says on the backend too: it is written once the back end's own

  // reading "2 working · 3 running" would be two different things counted in the same voice.
  // **AND `waiting-for-screen` GETS ITS OWN COUNT, OR THE PANE BECOMES UNREACHABLE.** CEO §56
  // added a first-class state for work that is waiting on the Mac being unlocked. It is
  // `is_open` in `AssignmentState` and deliberately NOT `awaits_his_word` — it resolves itself,
  // and "waiting for you" would be the nag §56 was given to avoid. So it appears in neither
  // `awaiting` above nor the two counts below, and an assignment in that state was his ONLY
  // open work would leave `parts` empty, hide the chip, and take the assignments pane with it —
  // no chip, no pane, no way to see the work at all. Raised by `echo-opus-screenwait1` as

// way the CEO launches it: `open` hands the process to launchd with working directory `/`,
// `EntityRegistry::resolve_root("/")` correctly refuses to guess, and the first sentence
// typed into the window came back as "no active thread, and no entity was named — Rich
// will not guess which entity area this belongs to." Zero lines reached the ledger.

// The picker WAS already opening on that launch. It did not help, for a reason nothing but
// a real launch would have shown: `init()` ends with `inputEl.focus()`, which took focus
// straight back off the picker's first row, so the composer was focused UNDER an open
// dialog and every keystroke went into a box that could not send. Both halves are fixed
// here — the answer is now durable, and focus stays where the question is.

// backdrop — the panel inside it is `.overlay-panel`. So every pixel around a compact
// centered panel dismissed the ONE step that puts an engine on the machine, and
// `closeSetupSheet` then handed straight off to the memory question. Measured under WebKit
// on both `missing-engine` and `missing-both`: sheet hidden=true, `run_setup` called=false,
// memory question showing=true. The app then looked set up and was not, and every send was
// refused for the rest of that install.
//
// A click that misses "Set it up" by sixty pixels is not consent to skip it. Neither is a
// click aimed at getting a window out of the way — a stranger dismisses dialogs by clicking
// beside them, and this is the first thing he ever sees. There is always a NAMED way out:
// "Not now" when there is something to install, "Close" when there is not, "Close" again
// once the run has finished. The only moment neither is on screen is during the install
// itself, and dismissing mid-download is precisely what must not happen either.
//
// ESCAPE IS NOT A MIS-AIMED CLICK, AND SINCE 2026-09-17 IT IS NOT INERT HERE EITHER. The CEO
// ruled that "the user must always be able to close any popup of any kind by simply tapping
// the escape key", and this sheet is a popup. What keeps the paragraph above true is the FORM
// of the declaration rather than an exception to his rule: `data-dismiss` on the element names
// "Not now" and "Close", so Escape presses whichever of them is on screen and does NOTHING
// when neither is. That is the named way out, reached by the keyboard — never a second,
// quieter way out that the buttons do not have. During the install itself both buttons are
// hidden, so Escape is inert exactly then, which is the moment the defect above was about.
// `setup.js` case 14 holds all of it: the backdrop, the panel body, Escape mid-install, and
// Escape's equivalence to the button the rest of the time.

// THE CORRECTION DESK — §7 "ask, never infer", made clickable
//
// `ceo-decisions.md` §7 governs both families absolutely: *"Nothing is ever learned
// silently."* The Rust side has enforced that since 2026-08-29 (`correction.rs`) and
// 2026-08-30 (`staging.rs`) — `confirm` is the only path to a write in either desk, and
// there is no argument a caller could pass to skip the ask. Fourteen Tauri commands
// implement it and, until this file changed, `app/ui/` invoked none of them: RICH-TODOs
// row 5b, and `loro-writer.md`'s own words — *"nothing in `app/ui/` renders it, so the CEO
// cannot yet click it."*
//
// THIS LAYER DECIDES NOTHING. Every sentence of judgement on this surface comes from the
// backend: the loro preview is the WRITER'S own `--dry-run` bytes (`correction.rs:366-369`
// — "a preview generated by anything other than the writer would be a description of a
// write rather than the write"), the spoken prompt is `staging.rs`'s `prompt_for`, and
// every refusal is relayed verbatim. What this file adds is the three buttons §7 names and
// an honest account of which of the two desks is actually running.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: a form for composing a correction.
// `loro_propose_correction` is mocked and reachable, and nothing on this surface calls it —
// nothing SHOULD. Since 2026-08-30 the proposals arrive on their own: `belief.rs` files one
// when the CEO says a record is wrong, inside `Spine::submit_prompt`, and this surface hears
// about it on `rich://loro-proposed`. The CEO corrects loro by TALKING, not by filling in a
// form.
// `loro-structure.md` is explicit about why — the pane's job is *inspection*, its primary
// action is "this is wrong", *"which opens a conversation, not a form"*, and *"a browsable,
// editable database invites the CEO to become a librarian"*. Detection (something noticing
// a correction and filing a proposal) is named as unbuilt in `correction.rs`'s module doc,
// and inventing a compose box here would be building the librarian instead of the desk.

// THE FEEDBACK CHANNEL — `feedback.rs`'s local half, made reachable (RICH-TODOs row 5)
//
// The row read as if nothing existed. At `aa364ed` that was wrong in one direction and
// right in the other: the module was complete — the CEO's wording in constants, the four
// keys, `Rating::invites_report`, the versioned taxonomy, the store, the disclosure, and
// four tests asserting no way off this machine — and `grep -rn feedback app/ui/main.js`
// returned nothing. There was no way for him to reach any of it.
//
// WHEN THIS SURFACE APPEARS, AND WHY THAT IS THE ANSWER
// ----------------------------------------------------
// When he opens it. There is no trigger, no timer, no end-of-session prompt, and no badge.
//
// That is not timidity, it is the module's own measurement: in the reference case all five
// moments of real annoyance were volunteered MID-WORK and unprompted, and none arrived at
// session end. A prompt fired at a moment of RichOS's choosing would have caught none of
// them at the moment they were felt. And the cost of firing one anyway is not zero — a
// prompt that arrives during the work he is annoyed about is one more unprepared task
// handed to him, which is the first term in this feature's own vocabulary. It also teaches
// dismissal, and a fallback he has learned to dismiss catches less than no fallback at all.
//
// What WOULD beat zero is catching what is already being said, mid-work, unprompted — which
// `feedback.rs` names as "a later, larger piece of work" and which this surface does not
// pretend to be. So: reachable when he wants it, and honest about being the fallback half.
//
// THIS LAYER AUTHORS NO WORDING. The question, the four keys, the offer, the disclosure
// heading and every term's sentence come from `feedback_wording` and `feedback_taxonomy`,
// which project `feedback.rs`'s constants. The module holds them in one place so the UI
// cannot paraphrase them; retyping one here would be the paraphrase it exists to prevent.
//
// NOTHING HERE SENDS ANYTHING. There is no transport in this file, and
// `feedback_no_outbound_tests.rs` asserts that of this file rather than trusting this
// sentence.

// TECHY MODE (techy-mode design §3.1/§3.3/§3.4) — the opt-in technical view
//
// Phase 1 (richos `48561e4`) routed every non-text agent frame into `rich://machinery` and
// retained it in a per-thread day-sharded journal. **Retention runs ALWAYS and has no
// setting** (§3.2) — that unconditional write is the only reason "show me the technical
// view for a conversation I already had" is possible at all, and the toggle below controls
// RENDERING and nothing else. Turning it off does not stop anything being written; turning
// it on does not reach back before 2026-08-28.
//
// §3.3'S CONSTRAINT, AND HOW IT IS HELD. "With techy mode off the conversation surface is
// byte-identical to today." So: `loadTimeline` calls the same `get_timeline` it always
// did, `renderTechyState(null)` leaves `#techy-state` hidden and empty, `#techy-chip` stays
// `hidden`, and the technical row in `timeline.js` cannot match because a CEO-view item
// carries no `detail`. There is no chip, no chevron and no "show technical details" hint in
// the conversation when the mode is off — a visible affordance IS a change to the default.
//
// FOUR OF THE CEO'S QUESTIONS ARE OPEN (§7 / open-items 1.4) AND NONE OF THEM IS ANSWERED
// HERE. Each is left as a setting somebody chooses:
//
//   §7.1 global default vs per-thread — BOTH exist and both are reversible. The checkbox in
//        Settings is the global switch; the shortcut pins ONE thread and leaves the switch
//        alone; a pinned thread can be handed back with `set_techy_mode(enabled: null)`.
//   §7.2 the raw-payload window — nothing on this surface knows it. An expanded pane shows
//        the payload or says it is no longer kept, and it says so WITHOUT naming a
//        duration: "14 days" in copy would answer the question in copy.
//   §7.3 whether customers can find it — the v1 answer here is §3.3's: a shortcut and one
//        Settings line, and NO conversation-surface affordance while it is off. Saying yes
//        later costs one element; taking calm back once given away costs a lot.
//   §7.4 whether deleting a thread deletes its machinery — no delete-thread command exists
//        and this surface does not add one. Both halves of either answer are primitives
//        already (`MachineryJournal::delete_thread`, `ConfigStore::forget_techy_thread`).
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT: a cockpit. There is no interrupt, no approve/deny, no re-run anywhere
// below. §5/§9 — techy mode is a window — and R2 business-action governance is deferred to
// V2 by CEO decision for v1 and all 1.x.
//
// ONE LIMIT, NAMED RATHER THAN HIDDEN: this is a RELOAD path, not a live technical stream.
// The `rich://machinery` event carries records the instant they happen, but the calm live
// family (`rich://activity-upserted`) is CEO-shaped by construction, so while a turn is
// running its rows appear WITHOUT their technical half and gain it when the turn ends —
// `loadTimeline` already runs on `rich://turn-completed`. Subscribing to `rich://machinery`
// here would give a live technical stream and would also make "the calm view does not
// subscribe to this event" (STREAMING.md, §3.3's test (a)) a runtime branch instead of a
// structural fact. That trade is not this slice's to make.

//   "By default (on first app start) the techy mode is off. But when the user toggles the
//    techy mode on while being inside a conversation thread, then there should be something
//    like a radio button choice between 3 choices. ... And the first choice should be
//    preselected after the user switches the techy mode on. That also means that later the
//    user should be able to switch off the techy mode for a given company or a given
//    thread."
//
// WHICH CONTROLS ASK: ALL OF THEM.
//
//   the settings menu's Techy Mode row  -> asks
//   the rail's "Show the technical view" switch -> asks
//   the chip in the conversation header -> asks (this is the switch-OFF path his last
//                                          sentence is about)
//   ⌘⇧T                                -> asks
//
// THE SHORTCUT WAS THE EXCEPTION FOR ONE DAY, AND THE EXCEPTION WAS WRONG. It was argued
// for here: ⌘⇧T is documented, in the hint under that very switch, as the control that
// "shows it for one conversation only", so pressing it already chose option 3, and routing
// it through a sheet whose first option is preselected would make ⌘⇧T + Enter turn the
// technical view on everywhere. Read again, that argument rests entirely on a sentence THIS
// FILE WRITES — the hint is ours, not his — and his own sentence has no exception in it:
// "when the user toggles the techy mode on while being inside a conversation thread, then
// there should be something like a radio button choice between 3 choices". A shortcut is a
// way of toggling it on. So the hint now promises the choice, the shortcut opens the sheet
// with his first option preselected, Enter confirms it, and the inversion the old argument
// feared is gone with the promise it was reading: nothing in the product tells him ⌘⇧T
// means one conversation any more.
//
// AND ON THE OPENING SCREEN THERE IS NO CHOICE TO MAKE. With no conversation open, "this
// company" and "this conversation" have no referent, so two of the three options are dead;
// the switch writes the global default directly. A radio group with one live option is a
// question pretending to be a choice.
//
// THE PRESELECTION IS THE SAME IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. He specified it for switch-on. Nothing
// in the store argues for a different one on switch-off, and one preselection a person can
// learn once beats two that have to be checked every time. What stops an accidental

//
// CEO, 2026-09-17, item 1 of his v1.0.2 list, verbatim:
//
//     "The user must always be able to close any popup of any kind by simply tapping the
//      escape key on the keyboard i.e. without having to click anything"
//
// WHAT WAS HERE BEFORE WAS A LIST, AND A LIST IS WHAT FAILED HIM. The handler above named
// eight surfaces. The window ships more than eight: `#assertiveness-popover` — the gear, the
// most-used popup in the product — was never in it, and neither were `#setup-sheet`,
// `#memory-setup`, `#set-menu`, `#permission-sheet`, `#repositories-sheet` or `#home-prefs`.
// Three of those carry their OWN Escape handler bound to the popup element, which means each
// works only while focus is inside it: click the dimmed area beside a permission request and
// the keyboard could no longer answer it at all. Adding seven more lines to the list would
// have fixed today and left tomorrow's popup out, so the enumeration is DERIVED instead:
//
//   * POPUP_SELECTOR asks the DOM what is a popup, by the structure the stylesheet already
//     gives one (`.overlay`, `.popover`, `.menu`, `.setmenu`, `role="dialog"`, `role="menu"`)
//     plus anything that declares itself with `data-dismiss`. A popup added next month is in
//     the enumeration the moment it is written, with nothing to remember;
//   * `data-dismiss` says HOW a surface closes, on the surface, where the person adding one
//     is already typing. `escape` means Escape closes it outright; `control:#a,#b` means
//     Escape does exactly what the first of those controls that is on screen and enabled
//     does, and NOTHING when none of them is — which is how a sheet that must not be
//     dismissed mid-install stays put without Escape needing to know why;
//   * `escape.js` in the acceptance suite refuses any structurally-a-popup element that
//     carries no declaration, so the marker cannot be forgotten quietly. Its positive control
//     plants an undeclared popup and watches that check go red.
//
// TOPMOST FIRST, AND "TOPMOST" IS MEASURED RATHER THAN RANKED. The old list was an order
// somebody chose; this reads the stacking the browser actually paints — computed `z-index`
// descending, ties broken by document order descending, which is CSS's own painting rule.
// So `#home-prefs` (340) outranks `#set-menu` (301) outranks `.menu` (70) outranks `.overlay`
// (60) outranks `#slideover` (31) outranks `#inspector` and `.popover` (20) because that is
// what the stylesheet says, and a restyle moves the dismissal order with the paint order
// instead of leaving the two disagreeing.

/// Everything the window can put ON TOP of the conversation. Structure first — a popup is

// A QUESTION OWNS THE WINDOW UNTIL IT IS ANSWERED — Ray's candidate .16 audit, row B1b
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// HIS MEASUREMENT: *"With the sheet up, the whole app subtree is still in the AX tree, the
// composer holds focus and accepts typed characters, and the top-right Settings control is
// still clickable and takes focus away from the sheet."* Reproduced under WebKit at 1400x950
// on `setup: "missing-engine"`, curtain gone: `#input`, `#rail-settings` and `#set-btn` each
// took focus on `.focus()`, and a click on `#set-btn` opened `#set-menu` OVER the sheet
// (`hidden=false`, `aria-expanded=true`) — so the half of his sentence that says the control
// "does nothing" is kinder than what the window actually does.
//
// `aria-modal="true"` IS A PROMISE AND `inert` IS THE ONLY THING THAT KEEPS IT. The sheet has
// carried that attribute since it was written; nothing in the window ever made it true.
//
// WHY THE TWO OBVIOUS FIXES ARE NOT THE FIX, and both were measured rather than argued:
//
//   * MOVING THE SHEET TO BODY LEVEL closes nothing. `.settings` is mounted against
//     `document.body` (`settings-button.js:748`) at z-index 300 — §15's "on every screen" —
//     and an `.overlay` is 60 wherever it lives. Measured stack at the button's own center
//     with the offer up: `set-btn@auto` inside `settings@300`, above `setup-sheet@60`.
//   * MARKING `#app` INERT cannot be done from inside `#app`: `#setup-sheet` is a child of it
//     (`index.html:936` against `:100`), so the one attribute would inert the question too.
//
// SO WHAT IS MARKED IS THE COMPLEMENT OF THE QUESTION'S OWN ANCESTOR CHAIN: at every level
// from the sheet up to `<html>`, every sibling that is not on the chain. That needs no opinion
// about where a sheet lives — a sheet moved to `<body>` tomorrow is covered by the same walk —
// and it reaches `.settings` precisely because `<body>` is on the chain.
//
// WHICH SHEETS, AND WHY NOT ALL SEVEN `aria-modal` OVERLAYS. The trigger is the declaration
// already on the element: `aria-modal="true"` AND a `data-dismiss` that names a CONTROL rather
// than `escape`. That pair is "a question with one named way out" — `#setup-sheet` and
// `#memory-setup`, the two first-run questions, and the two whose backdrop deliberately does
// not dismiss them (`704b4596`). The other five (`#search-overlay`, `#entity-picker`,
// `#corrections-overlay`, `#feedback-overlay`, `#techy-scope`) are dismissed from OUTSIDE
// themselves, so "the outside is unavailable" is not what they mean and enforcing it there is
// a different change from this one. Their `aria-modal` promise is still unkept, and saying so
// here is better than quietly widening a fix nobody measured.
//
// EVERY MARK IS SIGNED (`data-question-inert`) AND ONLY SIGNED MARKS ARE CLEARED, so a subtree
// that is inert for its OWN reason — `home.js` holds `#app` inert while the opening screen is
// up — is never un-inerted by this file on its way past.

  // double-clicked launch: `startNewThreadFlow()` opens the dialog and focuses its first
  // row, and then this ran and took focus straight back. Measured on a real Finder launch
  // of the f44f89a bundle — the picker was open on screen, `AXFocusedUIElement` was the
  // composer behind it, and the sentence typed into it was refused.
  // The memory dialog is in this condition for exactly the reason the picker is: it is a
  // question, and taking focus off a question to put it on a composer behind that question
  // is the measured defect this line already carries the scar of.
  //
  // ...AND IT WAS A LIST OF TWO, WHICH IS WHY IT HAPPENED A THIRD TIME. The condition named
  // `#entity-picker` and `#memory-setup` and not `#setup-sheet`, so the ENGINE OFFER — the
  // one question a customer's Mac is asked before it can do anything at all — was the third
  // dialog this line took focus off. Ray, candidate .16, `esc-20260919T171553Z-e42d1166`:
  // the sheet on screen and `AXFocusedUIElement` reading `text area Message to Rich`.
  //
  // MEASURED HERE, under WebKit, with the bridge costing a task per command the way a real
  // IPC round trip does: `home.js`'s give-way hands focus to `#setup-go` at t=252 ms and
  // this line takes it to `#input` at t=304 ms — 52 ms later, and last, so it wins.
  //
  // SO THE CONDITION IS DERIVED AND NOT LISTED, from the same enumeration the Escape rule
  // uses (`openPopups`, and `escape.js` refuses a structurally-a-popup element that declares
  // no dismissal). "Something is asking him a question" IS "a popup is on screen" — there is
  // no third thing — and a dialog written next month is in this condition the day it is
  // written, with nothing for its author to remember. Measured empty at boot on the ordinary
  // launch, so the composer is still focused for every CEO who is not being asked anything.

  // the comment three lines down says so about the desk. The curtain leaves at exactly
  // that point, mid-ceremony if the launch was quick, because a doorway that holds him
  // back from his work has inverted the product.
