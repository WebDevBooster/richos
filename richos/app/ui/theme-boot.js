// THE PRE-PAINT THEME BOOT — synchronous, tiny, and first in `<head>` on purpose.
//
// The durable answer to "which theme?" and "how big is the type?" lives in `config.rs`,
// beside `splash_enabled` and `techy_default`, and it reaches this UI over the Tauri
// bridge — which is asynchronous. An async read cannot decide the FIRST FRAME. Boot the
// app on the default and reconcile a moment later and the CEO who chose light mode gets a
// full-screen flash of midnight blue on every single launch, which is exactly the kind of
// thing that makes a calm instrument feel cheap.
//
// So this file runs BEFORE the stylesheets are even linked and applies a synchronous
// MIRROR of the durable preference. The mirror is not the source of truth and never
// decides anything on its own:
//
//   config.rs  is the truth. It survives reinstall-adjacent things the webview's storage
//              does not, and it is what the Rust side reads.
//   this mirror is a cache of that truth, written by `settings-button.js` on every change
//              and re-synced from config.rs by main.js at init. If the two ever disagree,
//              config.rs wins and the mirror is corrected — see `RichTheme.sync`.
//
// A first launch has no mirror, so it takes the default, and §63 (2026-09-19) is what
// the default is: "the app should detect the user's SYSTEM preference for dark or light
// theme and SYSTEM should be the default for a freshly installed app. Only if the user
// switches the theme to some other option, only then should the app remember that."
//
// So the default here is `system`, and it has to be the default HERE and not only in
// config.rs, for the same reason this file exists at all: config.rs arrives asynchronously.
// Boot the mirror on `dark` and reconcile to `system` a moment later and a light-OS user
// gets a full-screen flash of midnight blue on every launch — which is the exact defect
// the paragraph above describes, merely pointed the other way. The pair is the guarantee:
// both sides default to `system`, so the first frame and the settled frame agree.
//
// §15's "a newly installed app opens dark" did not go away; it moved. It governs the
// splash and the home screen, which are clamped dark through `forceDark` below — a FORCE
// flag and never a write, so the clamp can never be mistaken for a preference the user
// expressed. Nothing in this file writes a theme on his behalf: `setTheme` is only ever
// reached from the theme row he clicked, and `sync` copies config.rs's answer into the
// cache rather than forming an opinion of its own.
