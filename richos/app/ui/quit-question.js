// "YOU HAVE WORK RUNNING. QUIT ANYWAY?" — the background-work spec §2.5, §2.5a, §7.4a
// =======================================================================================
//
// The CEO's row 5: *"You close the window. The work keeps going. Quit ends it."* Closing
// the window no longer quits, so this sheet is rare rather than constant — it appears only
// when he chooses Quit while something is actually running or waiting for him.
//
// **The decision is already made by the time this renders.** §2.5a: the runtime reads the
// exit answer synchronously, so the shell PREVENTS the quit first and asks second. Pressing
// "Keep working" therefore does nothing at all — the work was never touched — and that is
// why this file has no undo, no retry and no state of its own.
//
// **The sentence comes from the shell** (`src-tauri/src/lifecycle.rs`'s `quit_question`),
// in his own terms, and so do both control labels. One place, so what the button says and
// what it does cannot drift apart.
//
// CONTRAST, COMPUTED AND NOT EYEBALLED, both themes — the standing floor (`CLAUDE.md`).
// Every class here is one the permission sheet already uses, and every ratio is re-measured
// under WebKit by `ui/tests/quit-question.js` rather than trusted from this comment:
//   title      `--ink` on `--card`             12.06:1 dark   18.07:1 light  (needs 4.5:1)
//   question   `--ink-soft` on `--card`         5.78:1 dark    6.36:1 light  (needs 4.5:1)
//   both controls, `.desk-btn`, 16px            measured in the suite, both themes
// Nothing here is declared exempt: a question he is being asked is the definition of text
// meant to be read.
