  // =====================================================================================
  //
  // A different thing from the receipts above, and the difference is the point: a receipt
  // describes what a worker did, and an assignment describes what the CEO ASKED FOR. It
  // exists from the moment he speaks, before a workspace does.
  //
  // **This is also the only surface that can show background work at all.** The live worker
  // chip is fed by `get_worker_status`, which returns an empty view whenever no turn is open
  // on the thread — and that window is where background work lives.
  //
  // WORDING IS THE FEATURE, not a detail of it — and what the words are FOR changed on
  // 2026-09-18 (CEO ruling §52): *"There's nothing that ever not lands on its own here in the
  // terminal. Anything including things like design mockups always land before they are
  // presented to me for review. So, yes, always land on its own."*
  //
  // `blocked` used to read "Ready for you to approve", because the one thing that could stop
  // a background job was the step that would change his repository — it was not on the
  // permission desk's list and the job waited there (spec §0 row 7, §5.4, §7.8). A job lands
  // on its own now, so:
  //
  //   * `blocked` means ONE thing: a decision of his is outstanding on some step — a command,
  //     a write outside the workspace — and Approve and Decline are beside it. It no longer
  //     claims his repository is untouched, because a job may reach such a step AFTER landing
  //     something, and that claim would have been false while his branch had already moved.
  //   * `settled` and `failed` carry the OUTCOME in the sentence the backend appends after
  //     them (`work_host.rs`'s `what_happened`, read off the land record the engine wrote):
  //     what landed, on which branch, in which repository, and the reviewer's verdict — or,
  //     for a job that did not land, why not.
  //
  // The §7.8 rule itself is untouched and still the floor: nothing that has not been witnessed
  // finishing is ever described as finished.
  //
  // CONTRAST, computed rather than eyeballed, both themes. Every figure below is WebKit's
  // own resolved color through `getComputedStyle`, taken by `ui/tests/background-work.js`
  // on 2026-09-18 — not a stylesheet value and not a recollection:
  //   heading    `--ink` on `--card`        12.06:1 dark   18.07:1 light   (needs 4.5:1)
  //   title      `--ink` on `--card`        12.06:1 dark   18.07:1 light   (needs 4.5:1)
  //   detail     `--ink-soft` on `--card`    5.78:1 dark    6.38:1 light   (needs 4.5:1)
  //   the question, 16px, same `--ink-soft`  5.78:1 dark    6.38:1 light   (needs 4.5:1)
  //   stop control, 16px, same `--ink-soft`  5.78:1 dark    6.38:1 light   (needs 4.5:1)
  //   approve and decline, 16px, the same    5.78:1 dark    6.38:1 light   (needs 4.5:1)
  // All seven at 16px, the floor for text meant to be easily read (`ceo-decisions.md` §15).
  // `--ink-soft` is `rgba(223,228,238,0.64)` over `#182440` and `rgba(12,19,34,0.68)` over
  // `#fdfcf8`; both were composited before the ratio was taken. Nothing here is exempt —
  // every ratio above is re-measured under WebKit by that suite in both themes rather than
  // trusted from this comment. (The light-mode soft figure reads 6.38:1 on this run where an
  // earlier comment recorded 6.36:1. Nothing in this file's palette, classes or opacity
  // changed; the measurement is the authority and the comment now carries what it measured.)
