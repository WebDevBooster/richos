// THE QUIT QUESTION, against the REAL sheet under WebKit.
//
// The background-work spec (richos-hq `docs/plans/background-work-spec-2026-09-17.md`
// revision 5) §2.5, §2.5a and acceptance §7.4a: *"He quits while work is running, and he is
// told before it dies … with an assignment running, choose Quit; the choice appears; cancel
// it and the work is still running; choose it again and quit."*
//
// THREE THINGS THIS SUITE PINS.
//
//   1. **The choice APPEARS, and the safe answer is the one under the return key.** A sheet
//      that opened with "quit and stop the work" focused would answer itself.
//   2. **Canceling changes nothing.** §2.5a's whole shape is prevent-first, ask-second, so
//      "Keep working" must reach `cancel_quit` and nothing else — never a stop, never a
//      second exit.
//   3. **Contrast, computed in BOTH themes**, off WebKit's own resolved colors, composited
//      where the palette uses alpha. Nothing on this sheet is declared exempt: it is a
//      question he is being asked, which is the definition of text meant to be read.
//
// The sheet renders from `ui/quit-question.js` as shipped — not a copy of it — with the
// shipping stylesheet attached from disk, and both are proven present before any ratio is
// taken.
