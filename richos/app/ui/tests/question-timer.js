// "I'll check." / "I'll investigate." — the timer beside his reply, against the REAL
// renderer under WebKit.
//
// The CEO's ruling §58 (`richos-hq` `wiki/ceo-decisions.md:2884-2914`, 2026-09-18), verbatim
// on the two halves this suite is about:
//
//   *"the "working..." timer should start running or maybe even better: a separate type of
//    timer for this kind of thing. So, in this case instead of "working" it would say
//    "investigating" next to the timer."*
//
//   *"a check still running at one minute flips its label to 'investigating' on its own."*
//
// WHAT THE BRIEF FOR THIS SLICE GOT WRONG, because it shaped the suite. It said the timeline
// timer "reads 'checking' or 'investigating' (not 'working', which stays for tasks)". There is
// no per-assignment timer beside a reply for a task: `Working for {d}` is the TURN timer, and
// under §55 the front desk's turn ENDS with its short reply — so that row reads `Worked for
// 2s` beside a question that is still being answered. So the check below is not "the word
// changed"; it is "a row that would have read `Worked for 2s` reads `Checking for 3s`", and
// the `working` scan is a NEGATIVE control rather than a relabeling.
//
// FOUR PROPERTIES, each a way this could quietly start lying:
//
//   1. THE WORD IS RIGHT FOR THE KIND, and "working" never appears beside a question. Read
//      off the rendered DOM, with a positive control — the same row with no question in
//      flight, which DOES say "Worked" — so a scan that can never fire is not mistaken for a
//      clean result.
//   2. THE FLIP IS MECHANICAL AND ON TIME. Bought with a clock rather than with a wait: the
//      page's `Date.now` is not touched at all, because `updateTimers` takes `nowMs` as an
//      argument, so the instant is supplied directly. Asserted at 59,999 ms (still checking)
//      and at 60,000 ms (investigating) — the boundary itself, in both directions.
//   3. THE TIMER STOPS WHEN THE ANSWER ARRIVES, and it stops because the RECORD stopped
//      saying so, not because anything here timed it out. Driven by handing
//      `setQuestionsInFlight` the register's next read with the row settled.
//   4. IT CLEARS WCAG AA IN BOTH THEMES, computed from WebKit's own resolved colors with the
//      shipping checker's arithmetic (`lib/contrast.js`), composited against the real ancestor
//      background. 4.5:1 for the label; nothing here is declared exempt — a timer telling him
//      his question is being looked into is text he is expected to read.
//
// PROVEN ABLE TO FAIL, on the check most likely to rot into a rubber stamp. With
// `CHECK_BECOMES_INVESTIGATE_MS` temporarily set to 30000, the flip check reported
// `it flipped early` and the run went red. A boundary gate nobody has watched fail is a
// boundary gate nobody should believe. The `working`/`worked` scan carries its own positive
// control in check 6 — the same row with no question in flight, which DOES say "Worked".
//
// NO AUDIO PATH IS TOUCHED: headless WebKit, no voice mode, no output device, no playback.
//
// RUN:  node question-timer.js
