// USE RICH FROM YOUR PHONE — the pairing screen, its QR code measured FROM THE PIXELS, and the
// one path CEO §61 leaves.
//
// **§61, 2026-09-18:** *"it's an app that lets the user use RichOS (in some way) while being on
// the go and away from office i.e. outside the home network. Because any mobile app or PWA is
// utterly useless within the home network … The Tailscale setup is where we start now."* The
// route chooser, the self-signed certificate, the trust code and the sixteen taps through Apple's
// settings are gone from the product, and the checks that pinned them are gone with them — checks
// 4, 5 and 6 are now about what replaced them, and 27, 29 and 30 about the screens that remain.
// Check 5 is the one that would notice a second path coming back on this surface;
// `tests/no-home-network.js` is the one that would notice it coming back anywhere.
//
// TWO JOBS, AND THE FIRST ONE IS A DEBT THIS FILE EXISTS TO PAY.
//
// `contrast.js` check 14 refuses a `<canvas>` on any walked surface, because a computed-style walk
// cannot read a pixel one painted — *"a green run here must not be read as covering it. If it
// belongs to a surface that IS measured from the pixels somewhere, exclude it here BY NAME and say
// where — never by raising a threshold."* The pairing screen has a canvas, so the exclusion names
// this file, and check 3 below is what makes that name worth something: it reads the rendered
// QR back with `getImageData` in the same WebKit and asserts what is actually painted.
//
// THE SECOND JOB IS THE PORT. `ui/qr.js` is `tools/phone-probe/lib/qr.js` with three changes and
// no more — the source of record is the probe's, which is checked against ISO/IEC 18004's own
// Annex I example and, end to end, by decoding a rendered PNG with Apple's Vision framework.
// Check 1 runs both modules over the same strings and asserts the matrices are identical, module
// for module. That is the only thing a second copy of anything can usefully promise, and without
// it the copy would be a second implementation to be wrong in a second way.
//
