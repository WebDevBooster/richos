// Run every browser suite in this directory, in order, and fail loudly.
//
// Each suite is a plain node script that exits non-zero on any failure, so it is runnable on
// its own (`node workers.js`) when you are working on one thing.
//
// THE INVENTORY IS DISCOVERED FROM DISK, NEVER TYPED. This file used to carry a hand-written
// SUITES array, and slice 6 landed `steering.js` that the array did not name — so a passing
// `run.js` would have reported "all 4 suites passed" while silently running none of its 24
// checks. That is the same defect, in its fifth costume, that produced "13/13 guards" over a
// typed list, "18/18 suites" over one directory's glob, and an install.sh whose HOOK_FILES had
// drifted from the registration. Add a suite and it runs; there is no second place to update.
//
// Zero suites found is exit 2, not "all 0 suites passed" — an empty inventory reporting green
// is exactly how an unreachable CI workflow looked green for months.
//
// AND AN EXIT CODE IS NOT EVIDENCE. Discovery fixed which suites are STARTED. It says nothing
// about what they DID, and every failure this repository has had in this family exited 0
// honestly: a scanner that reported CLEAN over an empty corpus did run, and a suite that
// checks nothing passes perfectly. A CI runner reporting green over that is worse than no CI,
// because it converts "nobody checked" into "somebody checked and it was fine".
//
// So each suite now reports how many checks it ran, through the ledger in `lib/harness.js`,
// and this file gates on the numbers:
//
//   * a suite that produced NO ledger record at all did not check anything — FAIL, whatever
//     it exited;
//   * a suite that ran FEWER checks than its own source declares stopped early — FAIL. The
//     declared count is `run.check(` counted in the suite's own source, so BOTH sides are
//     read off disk and there is no number typed anywhere for someone to forget to update;
//   * a suite that SKIPPED is named and fails the run, unless it was explicitly allowed with
//     `--allow-skip=<file>` — which is a visible argument at the call site, not a silent
//     branch inside the suite;
//   * a suite that RECORDED FAILED CHECKS fails the run whatever it exited;
//   * zero total checks is a failure even if every suite exited 0.
//
// THAT THIRD CLAUSE IS NEW, AND A REAL RUN EARNED IT. On 2026-09-04 the first public
// `ui-suite-ci` run printed, in its own evidence table:
//
//     FAIL            home.js — 29 check(s) run, 28 declared, 2 failed (exit 0)
//
// ...and then reported "2 suite(s) FAILED: scale.js, splash.js". home.js is the one suite in
// this directory that calls `run.report()` and throws the number away, so its process exited
// 0 with two checks red — and this file gated on exit codes alone, so two failures on the
// CEO's own home screen were printed as FAIL and counted as fine. That is this file's entire
// thesis ("AND AN EXIT CODE IS NOT EVIDENCE") failing on the one path where the evidence and
// the exit code disagreed, and the ledger already held the number needed to catch it.
//
// The suite is fixed too — `home.js` exits on its own failures now, as the other twenty do —
// but a gate that depends on twenty-one authors each remembering one line is not a gate.
//
// The relation is `observed >= declared`, not `==`: several suites drive their checks from a
// loop (affordances.js declares 16 and runs 46). A scanner mistake can therefore only make
// this gate STRICTER — it cannot manufacture a green run.

// QUARANTINE — WHY IT IS HERE AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT COVER.
//
// A gate that turns test rot into a failed BUILD stops the build and does not fix the app.
// The CEO's question, 2026-09-19: "Will that get me back to that endless fixing of millions
// of bugs without doing any actual work?" A quarantined suite still RUNS, is still counted,
// and is still printed in the build's own output on every single run — it just does not
// hold the build. That is the difference between knowing a suite is rotten and pretending
// it is green.
//
// TWO THINGS KEEP THE LIST FROM ROTTING, and they matter more than the excusing does:
// a quarantined suite that PASSES says so, loudly, as a note naming the row to delete; and
// the list is supplied by the CALLER, so it is printed where the caller's output is read
// rather than living in this directory where nobody re-reads it.
//
// A MISSING RECEIPT IS NEVER EXCUSED. Quarantine is a statement about a suite's own
// assertions being stale. "Nothing was written down" is not that: it means a shard died, or
// never started, or its artifact vanished — an integrity failure of the run itself, which
// is precisely the class this whole file exists to refuse. Excusing it would let a
// quarantine entry silently hide a broken harness.

// WHY THIS COMMAND EXISTS. `suite-weights.tsv` is the only input to packing, and on
// 2026-09-20 it named 32 of 55 suites. `pack()` weighs an unweighted suite as the heaviest
// one known — a deliberately safe default — so 25 suites (23 absent, plus `dialect.js` and
// `docs-claims.js` whose measured `0` the loader was discarding) were each packed as 305 s.
// That is 7625 s of load that does not exist, against 2155 s that does, so the packer was
// balancing four shards of mostly fiction and the balance it reported was an artifact:
// every shard showed 2446 s while the REAL measured load was 311 / 311 / 920 / 613 s. One
// shard carried three times another, the run took as long as its longest shard, and nobody
// could see it because the plan said the shards were even.
//
// A weights file maintained by hand drifts the moment a suite is added, which is exactly
// what happened. This command regenerates it from a real run's receipts — the same receipts
// the coverage job reconciles — so the fix is re-derivable in one command instead of being
// a number somebody remembered to update.
//
// IT REFUSES A PARTIAL SET. Writing weights for the suites that happen to have receipts
// would silently DELETE the weight of every suite that did not, turning each of them back
// into a 305 s phantom. The whole inventory, or nothing.
