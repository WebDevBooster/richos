// **CODE THAT IS ONLY CORRECT WHEN THE BRIDGE IS INSTANT** — the class of defect, with a lever
// that makes it visible on demand.
//
// Two shipped defects were measured on 2026-09-06 by `tom-opus-bw1` while replacing this
// directory's blind waits with real signals, and raised as `esc-20260906T085912Z-4005a6b5`.
// Both were the same shape: an interaction whose correctness depended on a bridge call
// returning before something else happened, which is true in an in-page mock and false on a
// Tauri IPC call. Neither is a test artifact and neither could be seen at zero latency.
//
//   1. A THREAD PRESSED DURING BOOT COULD OPEN A DIFFERENT THREAD. `main.js`'s `init()` painted
//      real, handler-wired `.nav-thread` buttons and then made five more bridge calls before
//      opening the thread the LAST session ended on — over the top of the one the CEO had just
//      pressed, with no error. At 120 ms, pressing "hiring" landed him on "general": Harbor
//      Analytics, "Running", zero turns.
//
//   2. THE UPDATE CONTROL COULD NOT BE REACHED IN ONE KEYSTROKE. `updates.js`'s `openTheRow()`
//      deferred the cue's focus with `setTimeout(..., 0)`, which fired while `#update-install`
//      was still `disabled` by the menu's own in-flight `update_state` read. Focus landed at
//      0 ms of bridge latency and never at 10 ms or more, so §26's "one keystroke from the act"
//      held in a zero-latency fixture and nowhere else.
//
// THE LEVER IS THE POINT OF THIS FILE. `INSTRUMENTED_BRIDGE` puts a fixed latency on every call
// the page makes, wrapped at the ASSIGNMENT of `window.RichBridge` so every caller in the page is
// behind it. A check that is green at 0 ms and green at 400 ms is a check that waited for a
// signal; one that is green at 0 and red at 120 was measuring the machine. Each check below runs
// at THREE latencies — 0, 120 (an ordinary machine, and the number both defects were measured at)
// and 400 (slower still) — and states which, so a green line here is a statement about all three.
//
// WHAT THESE CHECKS ARE NOT. They are not a shorter window. Both fixes removed a DEPENDENCE on
// timing — a restore that yields to a choice, a ticket that abandons a stale chain, a focus bound
// to the control becoming usable — so the assertions below are about outcomes at any latency
// rather than about a race being won more often. If a future change reintroduces a window, these
// go red at 120 and 400 while staying green at 0, which is the signature to look for.
//
// PROVEN TO CATCH THE DEFECTS IT NAMES, not merely observed green. `app/ui/main.js` and
// `app/ui/updates.js` were restored to their pre-fix state at `041eee8`, this file left exactly
// as it stands, and the run reported 6 of its 9 checks red — verbatim, trimmed to the first line
// of each:
//
//     FAIL  a thread pressed during boot is the thread that opens (120ms bridge)
//             pressed "hiring" at +360ms and the conversation on screen is "Harbor Analytics /
//             Running" — the rail marks "general", the model is bound to "general", 0 turn(s)
//     FAIL  a thread pressed during boot is the thread that opens (400ms bridge)
//             pressed "hiring" at +1200ms ... the model is bound to "general", 0 turn(s) painted
//     FAIL  the shell remembers the thread he pressed, not the one the boot would have imposed
//             at 400ms ... the shell would restore "general"
//     FAIL  the update cue puts the hand on the control (0ms bridge)
//     FAIL  the update cue puts the hand on the control (120ms bridge)
//     FAIL  the update cue puts the hand on the control (400ms bridge)
//             the menu's own re-read must not disarm the control it opens onto
//     FAIL  the row's control is never disarmed by the menu's own re-read (400ms bridge)
//             the control was not pressable on 25 of 55 sampled frames
//
// THE THREE THAT STAYED GREEN ARE THE CONTROL CASES, and they are why the list above is evidence
// rather than a suite that fails at everything: the 0 ms thread press was correct before the fix
// (the defect needs latency), and "with no press at all, the boot still restores where the last
// session ended" was correct before it and must stay correct after — a fix that read "never
// restore" would have broken exactly that line.
//
// The cue check goes red at 0 ms as well, and that is not a stricter reading of the old defect —
// it is the same one seen without the fixture's help. The old `setTimeout(0)` fired after the
// microtask that resolved a 0 ms invoke, which is the entire reason the defect was invisible
// here; reading the focus in the SAME synchronous block as the press removes that accident.
//
// Run: node slow-bridge.js   (or `npm test` for every suite in this directory)
