// **WHERE THE TOP-RIGHT CHROME SITS, ON EVERY SURFACE, AND WHERE THE COMPOSER'S TWO BUTTONS
// SIT** — two CEO rulings from 2026-09-19, and the second one is a correction to the first.
//
// ## THE TWO RULINGS, IN THE ORDER HE GAVE THEM
//
// **1. The regular screens, the morning of 2026-09-19** — the settings button is centered in
// the thread header with 15px of right padding, and the two composer buttons match the text
// input. Checks 1 through 8 below, and the header that follows this one.
//
// **2. The home screen and the paused splash, the afternoon of the same day** — those two go
// back to where they were. Checks 2b through 2e. His words, with a before-and-after pair of his
// own screenshots (`docs/briefs/assets/ceo-2026-09-18-home-settings-button-before.png` and
// `ceo-2026-09-19-home-settings-button-after.png` in `richos-hq`):
//
//   *"Obviously changes to the settings button position on regular screens must have messed up
//    that button's position on the home screen (and probably also on the splash screen when
//    paused). The before position of the settings button on the home screen was good and
//    correct. The current position is messed up and wrong."*
//
// **THE SHAPE OF THE MISTAKE IS THE THING TO KEEP.** Ruling 1 was answered by moving the ONE
// fixed element `settings-button.js` mounts against `document.body` — and §15 puts that element
// on every screen, so an instruction about a 52px header reached two surfaces that have no
// header. A suite that only ever opened a thread could not see it, and this one did not. That
// is why `SURFACES` below is a table rather than three checks: the next instruction about this
// button will be about one surface too, and the table is what makes the other two answer for
// themselves.
//
// ## RULING 1, AS IT WAS WRITTEN
//
// CEO, 2026-09-19, on the nightly he watched at 8pm the evening
// before. His screenshot is `docs/briefs/assets/ceo-2026-09-18-composer-and-settings-button.png`
// in `richos-hq`; his three arrows mark the three spots this suite measures.
//
//   *"So, if those things haven't been fixed since, then the settings button needs to be
//    properly centered vertically and the right padding for that button needs to be reduced to
//    15px. And the 2 buttons at the bottom need to be either vertically center aligned relative
//    to the text input or have the same height as the text input because otherwise it looks
//    weird."*
//
// ## THE THREE NUMBERS, MEASURED ON `f918f185` BEFORE ANY OF THIS WAS WRITTEN
//
// Read through this same WebKit, at 1024x700 and at 1400x950, identical at both:
//
//     #stage-header        top 0, bottom 52            center y = 26
//     #set-btn             top 18, bottom 58           center y = 38   -> 12px LOW
//     #set-btn right edge  1009 wanted, 1006 measured                  -> 18px of padding
//     #input-shell         46px tall, center y = 661
//     #talk-toggle / #send 40px tall, center y = 664    -> 6px SHORT and 3px LOW
//
// The settings button did not merely sit low: its box ended at y=58 against a header whose
// bottom border is at y=52, so six pixels of it hung through the line. That is the overhang his
// arrow points at, and it is the reason "properly centered" is a measurement here and not an
// opinion.
//
// ## WHICH OF HIS TWO OPTIONS THE COMPOSER TOOK, AND WHY THE SUITE ACCEPTS EITHER
//
// `style.css` takes **the same height as the text input** — the reasoning is in the comment
// above `#composer-row`, and the short version is that the field grows with what he types, so
// centering is only available in one of the composer's states while matching the height
// degrades to bottom-flush in the rest. The checks below assert **his sentence**, not that
// choice: a button passes if its center matches the field's OR its height does. A later
// redesign that centers them instead is still right by the CEO, and this suite should not be
// the thing that stops it.
//
// THE FIELD IS `#input-shell`, NOT `#input`. The box a person sees is the bordered shell (46px);
// the textarea inside it is 44px. Both are reported by every check, so a reading can never be
// ambiguous about which one it matched.
//
// ## RULING 2, AND WHAT WAS MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS ANSWERED
//
// On `529dd6ec`, through this same WebKit, at 1024x700 and 1400x950 in both themes — twelve
// readings, all identical:
//
//     #set-btn on a thread                 top 6, right 15
//     #set-btn on the home screen          top 6, right 15
//     #set-btn on the held opening screen  top 6, right 15
//
// One element, one inset, three surfaces. So his parenthesis — *"and probably also on the splash
// screen when paused"* — is a confirmation rather than a guess, and the splash is checked here
// on the same footing as the home screen rather than as an afterthought.
//
// AFTER, same harness, same twelve readings: the thread is untouched at 6/15, and the two
// surfaces with no header of their own are back at 18/18, which is where `style.css` had them
// until `dcfb87c9` and where three committed home-screen shots that predate that commit still
// show them (`shots-home/home-named.png`, `home-anonymized.png`, `home-returned.png`, decoded
// at 1440x900: the button's top edge measures y=18 in each).
//
// ## THE NEGATIVE CONTROLS ARE FIRST IN EACH HALF, AND THEY ARE NOT DESCRIPTIONS
//
// Check 1 puts the three pre-fix declarations back through the CSSOM and requires the defect to
// measure EXACTLY as it measured on `f918f185` — 12px low, 18px of padding, 6px short and 3px
// low. If that check ever comes back clean, the four after it are proving nothing and say so.
//
// Check 2b does the same for ruling 2, on both corner surfaces: it forces the regular-screen
// pair onto the wrapper's own inline style — which outranks every selector in both stylesheets
// — and requires the button to measure the 6/15 the CEO photographed and called "messed up and
// wrong". Run against `529dd6ec`'s stylesheets, 2b and the nine checks after it are all red and
// the eighteen that were here before are all green; that is the split this file was extended to
// produce.
//
// Run: node chrome-align.js   (or `npm test` for every suite in this directory)
