// BUST A BUG — round 21 in the shipping renderer (CEO §115, 2026-10-09).
//
// His words are the acceptance criterion: "When the user has Claude set up in the app (which is
// the expected default), we should just let the user say what's wrong and where and let their
// Rich check and articulate everything properly and then submit a GitHub issue on their behalf."
//
// What this suite holds the window to, against `mock.js`'s stand-in for the shell's six
// `bug_report_*` commands (the shell's own half, and what is private, are tested in Rust:
// crates/richos-core/tests/bug_report_tests.rs):
//
//   1. Bust a bug starts the exchange with Rich in the conversation on screen; no notice.
//   2. The draft is shown before anything is sent: nothing reaches `bug_report_send` until Send.
//   3. Private details are left out: the card shows stand-ins, each saying what it replaced only
//      to the user, and the sheet that is sent carries the stand-ins and never the names.
//   4. Send: the card says Sent with the issue number, from the RichOS reporting account.
//   5. A failed send is kept and resent: offline, the report waits on this Mac and goes out by
//      itself when the connection is back, and Rich and a notice say so.
//   6. Change it (in place, with the privacy heads-up, and by telling Rich), Cancel, and one
//      report at a time.
//   7. Where a window covers the conversation, the exchange happens in the Rich panel beside it.
//   8. Both themes: every word on the card and in the panel meets WCAG AA and the 16px floor,
//      and every indicator 3:1, computed in WebKit (the "changing" and "canceling" states too).
//   9. The second review's cases (rv-20261009T102303Z-1c3dda1d-4c78, on 1c3dda1dc), each red
//      there: Rich's private words kept through changes, Send and Cancel held during a change,
//      Cancel confirmed (refused, or a retry already sending), Change it on a report that went
//      out, and the screen's words given to Rich with the window's picture asked for first.
//      `mock.js` holds a change or a cancel, fails a cancel, or files a waiting report mid-cancel.
//  10. The third review's cases (rv-20261009T135204Z-9f4d77d4-1892, on 9f4d77d44), each red
//      there: a name typed over a stand-in gets the heads-up before sending, a file address and
//      a drive path typed in get it too, and the digest of what Rich checked is 16px and no
//      longer exempt from the size check.
//  11. The fourth review's cases (rv-20261009T142223Z-3d74fe4c-3b6d, on 3d74fe4cb), each red
//      there: the heads-up is the core's answer (`bug_report_private_in`), so alice@büro.de is
//      named; and the voice hold follows the report's conversation, so speech reaches Rich after
//      leaving it. `mock.js` answers `bug_report_private_in` with `preset.bugPrivateWords`.
//  12. The review of 84d1bdced (rv-20261009T151254Z-84d1bdce-20df), red there: Send waits for
//      the privacy answer on the latest words, so the heads-up comes before the report goes out.
//      `mock.js` holds those answers with `preset.bugPrivateHold` until `releasePrivate()`.
//  13. The review of 3007e3200 (rv-20261009T174727Z-3007e320-578a), red there: words changed by
//      hand go out only after Rich has checked them (shown again with what he left out), and
//      wait on this Mac, unsent, when Claude can't check them. Whether a sheet may go is the
//      shell's decision (`richos_core::bug_report::decide`, tested in Rust); `mock.js` decides it
//      the same way and `filed()` is what actually went out.
