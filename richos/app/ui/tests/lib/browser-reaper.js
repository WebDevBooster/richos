// A UI suite's test browser must never outlive the suite that started it.
//
// WHY (2026-10-09): macOS showed the CEO "Playwright quit unexpectedly". The crash report
// (`Playwright-2026-10-09-152836.ips`) says `parentProc: "Exited process"`, SIGABRT inside
// AppKit's application registration, 80 ms after launch: a test WebKit (`Playwright.app`,
// a regular GUI application, so macOS shows a dialog when it crashes) started or kept running
// after the suite that owned it was gone. Playwright closes its browser on a clean exit and on
// SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP, but nothing can on SIGKILL, which is how a timeout or a build gate ends
// a suite, and a SIGKILLed suite leaves the browser orphaned.
//
// WHAT: `install(pw)` (called by the harness for every suite's Playwright) starts, on the first
// launch, one small detached watcher process. The watcher records the suite's descendants every
// 100 ms and, when the suite is gone for ANY reason, kills the ones still running. Only pids the
// watcher itself recorded as descendants of the suite are ever sent a signal, and a pid is
// checked against its recorded start time first, so a reused pid is never touched. SIGKILL
// leaves no crash report, so no dialog.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM: a suite killed in the ~100 ms between spawning the browser and the
// watcher's next look can still leave one browser.
