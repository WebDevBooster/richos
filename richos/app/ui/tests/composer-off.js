// **A SWITCHED-OFF COMPOSER LOOKS SWITCHED OFF** — candidate-.2 defect #6.
//
// `docs/verification/2026-09-17-nightly-1.2.0-20260917.2-onscreen-audit-2.md` §4:
//
//   *"#6 — the dead composer looks alive. Ran it on screen. Defer the company sheet, then
//    click the message box and type. The box reads 'Talk to Rich…', shows no disabled
//    styling, and silently discards every keystroke. The sheet did warn that the box would be
//    'switched off', but the box itself never says so. Expected: a switched-off input looks
//    switched off and says why. Control: after adding a company, typing in the same box works
//    immediately."*
//
// ## WHAT WAS ACTUALLY MEASURED, WHICH IS NOT QUITE WHAT THE WALK DESCRIBES
//
// Driven here through the real shell before the fix, the state was:
//
//     disabled     false          the box accepted focus and accepted letters
//     placeholder  "Talk to Rich…"
//     opacity      1
//     cursor       auto
//     send         enabled
//     typing "hello" -> value "hello", then Enter -> value still "hello", 0 messages sent
//
// So the keystrokes were not discarded on the way in; they were accepted, held, and then
// refused on the way out with no change to anything the box looked like. From where a person
// sits that is the same event — a box that took your sentence and did nothing with it — and
// the fix is the same fix. The distinction is recorded because a suite that asserted
// "keystrokes never arrive" would have been asserting something that was never true.
//
// ## THE RULE WAS ALREADY WRITTEN DOWN IN THIS PRODUCT
//
// `main.js`'s `showUnboundView`, for the OTHER blocked state: *"The placeholder is part of the
// block: an inviting 'Talk to Rich…' above a dead field is the composer telling a small lie
// about what it will do."* The company block never picked it up. This suite holds both states
// to it, and holds the way back — a company chosen, the box alive again — to the same bar.
//
// Run: node composer-off.js   (or `npm test` for every suite in this directory)
