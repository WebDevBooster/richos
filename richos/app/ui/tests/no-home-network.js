// NO HOME-NETWORK PATH IS EVER BUILT FOR THE PHONE AGAIN. This suite is the mechanism.
//
// **THE CEO, 2026-09-19, ~15:05Z, in full:** *"How many more times will any 'home network'
// related shit be associated with a phone or built for phone?"*
//
// The answer is zero, and it is zero by mechanism rather than by anyone remembering. He had to
// ask twice on the same day — *"What did I say previously about phone and 'home network'?"* and
// then *"What was unclear about what I said regarding the phone?"* — after a build that kept the
// route chooser, the self-signed certificate, the trust page and the sixteen certificate taps
// through §61, and after briefs that asserted §61 kept both paths. Nothing was unclear. What was
// missing was something that fails when the words come back.
//
// **CEO §61, 2026-09-18, which is the ruling this enforces:** *"the new working definition for a
// mobile app or PWA is this: it's an app that lets the user use RichOS (in some way) while being
// on the go and away from office i.e. outside the home network. Because any mobile app or PWA is
// utterly useless within the home network. The desktop app is a much better tool in that case.
// Now, here are the 2 things: 1) For non-technical CEOs I'll use the same approach that T3 Code
// is using i.e. the approach where I have to pay some money to run it. … 2) The RichOS desktop
// app will guide technical users (with the help of crystal-clear and ultra-simple how-to screens
// in the app) to their Tailscale setup. That's it. The Tailscale setup is where we start now."*
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT IT READS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// **It reads code and the strings a person sees. It does not read comments.** Every file under
// scan is stripped of its comments before a single pattern runs, because the record of a ruling
// is written in comments and a check that could not tell a ruling from a violation would be a
// check whose first correct answer is a false positive. `phone.js` opens by quoting §61 and
// naming the trust QR at `http://<name>.local:8444/ca` as the thing that was removed; that
// sentence must pass, and it does — this file's own header must pass too, and check 6 proves it.
//
// **The stripper respects strings, because `//` is inside every URL in this codebase.** A naive
// line-comment rule would cut `https://…` in half and hide the rest of the line from every
// pattern — a scanner that silently stops scanning, which is the exact failure mode
// `feedback_negative_tests_pass_for_wrong_reason.md` is about. Check 5 is the positive control:
// it plants each banned string in a scratch file, in code position, and requires this suite to
// find every one of them.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY A SUITE AND NOT A GIT HOOK
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// It runs in `ui/tests/run.js`, which is discovered from disk and runs at every land. A hook
// would live on one operator's machine, would be invisible to a fresh clone, and would be waived
// the first time it fired on a false positive — this project has three recorded instances of
// that pattern in one day. A suite that fails is a land that stops.
//
// Run: node no-home-network.js   (or `npm test` for every suite in this directory)
