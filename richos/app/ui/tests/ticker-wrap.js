// **THE TEMPORARY LINE DOES NOT LEAVE ONE WORD ON A LINE OF ITS OWN** — candidate-.2 #9.
//
// `docs/verification/2026-09-17-nightly-1.2.0-20260917.2-onscreen-audit-2.md` §4:
//
//   *"#9 — the temporary line wraps awkwardly. Ran it on screen. '→ 1 new memory' splits
//    across two lines, the second right-aligned. Legible, just untidy."*  (frame 33)
//
// ## WHAT IS ASSERTED IS THE RENDERED FRAME, NOT THE DECLARATION
//
// The fix is one CSS property, `text-wrap: pretty`, and a property is a hint. A check reading
// `getComputedStyle(...).textWrapStyle === "pretty"` would pass on a webview that parsed the
// value and did nothing with it, which is the one outcome worth catching. So every check here
// measures LINE BOXES — `Range.getClientRects()` over the element's own contents, grouped by
// their top edge — and asks how many words ended up on the last one.
//
// ## THE STRINGS ARE THE ENGINE'S, NOT THIS FILE'S
//
// Two sources, and neither is invented:
//
//   * the audit's own sentence, copied out of frame 33, which is the case that was reported;
//   * whatever `__loro.ingest()` actually writes, captured over a run of live lines and then
//     replayed into the same element so each one can be measured without racing its 2,600ms
//     life.
//
// `field-engine.js` composes that sentence from a specialist codename, a source word, a domain
// label and a count, so the population is real and this samples it rather than describing it.
//
// Run: node ticker-wrap.js   (or `npm test` for every suite in this directory)
