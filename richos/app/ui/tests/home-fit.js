// **THE HOME SCREEN AT THE SMALLEST WINDOW THE APP ADMITS TO** — candidate-.2 defect #4.
//
// `docs/verification/2026-09-17-nightly-1.2.0-20260917.2-onscreen-audit-2.md` §4:
//
//   *"#4 — home screen does not fit at 1024x700. Ran it on screen. Resize the window to the
//    app's own documented minimum (it restored this size itself on the next launch) and open
//    the home screen. 'INFRASTRUCTURE' loses its final E; the floating chip 'Initiative ·
//    Product' is cut mid-word by the 'This is what your home screen could look like…' panel
//    that sits over it; 'Organization · Product' lands on top of the PRODUCT label."*
//
// 1024x700 is not a size somebody has to go looking for. It is `min_inner_size` — the app's
// own floor, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` `minWidth: 1024 / minHeight: 700` and
// `window_geometry.rs` `PREFERRED_MIN_WIDTH/HEIGHT` — and the walk's window restored itself
// to exactly it on the next launch.
//
// ## WHAT THIS SUITE MEASURES, AND WHOSE NUMBERS THEY ARE
//
// `home/field-engine.js` exports the picture's own geometry and this file reads it rather
// than re-deriving it:
//
//   `__loro.domLabelRects`   the domain names it drew, box by box
//   `__loro.nodeLabelRects`  the chips it drew under the cursor, box by box
//   `__loro.eraseRects`      the rectangles `clearQuiet()` rubs out, straight off `quietRects`
//   `__loro.labelBlockers`   the whole no-caption list, the first-run banner included
//
// A test carrying its own copy of the quiet-rectangle arithmetic would be a test of the copy,
// which is rule 1 of this directory's harness ("THE REAL RENDERER, NEVER A COPY"). The price
// of reading the product's own list is that an EMPTY list would pass everything, so check 1
// is a negative control on the list itself: it counts the rects and proves each one covers the
// chrome element it is supposed to cover, measured from the DOM independently.
//
// ## THE SWEEP, AND WHY IT IS A SWEEP
//
// Three of the four symptoms only exist while the cursor is summoning chips, and where the
// cursor is decides which chips. One sample proves nothing about the next one: the first
// measurement taken here, at one hand-picked cursor position, showed a 1.36px overlap and
// would have looked like a rounding argument. The same 12x11 grid, before the fix, showed
// 15 chips under the banner and 106 chips across a domain name.
//
// ## ONE CORRECTION TO THE AUDIT, AND IT IS THE CONTROL SIZE
//
// The audit records 1400x880 as clean, and for the three symptoms it names it is. The
// underlying mechanism was firing there too: the same sweep at 1400x880, before the fix,
// found 269 samples whose box lay inside an erase rectangle — every one of them by less than
// the label's own 8px margin, so no glyph was ever cut and nothing was visible to a person
// looking at the screen. "Clean at 1400x880" is therefore true of what the walk could see and
// not true of what the renderer was doing, which is why this suite counts the two separately.
//
// Run: node home-fit.js   (or `npm test` for every suite in this directory)
