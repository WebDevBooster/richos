// HIS TEAM, ON THE CONVERSATION'S TIMELINE — the operator notice surface.
//
// The operator-client record's §7 item 1 (richos-hq
// docs/verification/2026-09-25-operator-client/README.md): the operator notice kinds
// (update, question, answer, outcome, failed, alarm, team) on the conversation's timeline, WCAG
// AA in both themes. The seam was built before the surface and is not changed by it:
// `take_operator_notices` reads AND marks `<app data>/operator/<entity>/<thread>/notices.jsonl`,
// and `rich://operator-notice` only wakes that read (`app/STREAMING.md`, "His team, on an
// operator install"). Only an install whose `operator.json` passed the gate has a desk; on any
// other the command answers an empty list and the event is never emitted.
//
// WHAT THIS SUITE PINS, each negative beside a positive control that proves it could fail:
//
//   1. Every kind draws the notice card with a from-line saying who it is from and what kind
//      of line it is, the words verbatim, and none of Rich's identity or his Copy control.
//   2. The attribution is only claimed where it is true: `team` is RichOS speaking about his
//      team and `alarm` is his engine, so neither says "Your team"; an `outcome` never says
//      done or finished; an unknown kind is drawn, as "About your team".
//   3. The durable half: notices said while the window was not listening are drawn when the
//      conversation opens, where they happened in his scrollback, marked told, and never drawn
//      twice. The assignment is named by its title, never its identifier.
//   4. The live half: a pushed notice is drawn; one pushed while a turn runs is HELD and drawn
//      at the boundary, never mid-sentence and never dropped.
//   5. One report, one card: a report that closes an assignment arrives on both lanes with
//      the same words, in either order, and is one attributed card; two assignments that say
//      the same sentence are still two cards.
//   6. On any other install nothing changes: the shell asks, the answer is empty, no team
//      card is drawn, and a background result still draws as the app's own status line.
//   7. It survives his next sentence (the snapshot reload), attribution included.
//   8. CONTRAST, computed from WebKit's resolved colors, for every kind in BOTH themes: the
//      from-line and the body at 4.5:1 and at least 16px, the left rule at 3:1.
