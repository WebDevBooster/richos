// THE BACKGROUND-WORK SURFACE, against the REAL renderer under WebKit.
//
// The background-work spec (richos-hq `docs/plans/background-work-spec-2026-09-17.md`
// revision 5, `9255e71a`), §0 rows 6 and 7, §3.5, §4.2 and §7.8.
//
// TWO THINGS THIS SUITE EXISTS TO PIN, and the first one is a sentence rather than a
// mechanism:
//
//   1. **An unfinished job is never described as finished.** §7.8's rule — *"the wording is
//      the test, not a detail of it"* — survives the CEO's ruling §52 (2026-09-18); its
//      example does not. §7.8's two sentences were "Ready for you to approve" and "done",
//      because the one thing that could stop a job was its land. *"There's nothing that ever
//      not lands on its own here in the terminal … So, yes, always land on its own"*, so the
//      sentence a stopped job actually carries is now "Waiting for your decision before it
//      can go on" — a decision of his on some step, with no claim about his repository,
//      which a job that lands on its own cannot make. This reads the words off the rendered
//      DOM, and the negative scan carries a POSITIVE CONTROL — the same scan run against the
//      `settled` row, which DOES speak of finishing — because a forbidden-word scan that can
//      never fire passes for its own reasons.
//
//   2. **A result waits for the boundary and is never dropped** (§3.5, §0 row 6). The hold
//      is in `main.js`, so that half is read from the source rather than driven: the whole
//      shell needs a live Tauri bridge to run a turn, and a suite that mocked one would be
//      asserting about its own mock. What IS driven here is the renderer.
//
// CONTRAST IS COMPUTED, NEVER EYEBALLED, and in BOTH themes — the standing floor
// (`CLAUDE.md`, "Contrast — WCAG AA, ALWAYS, BOTH THEMES"). The ratios come out of WebKit's
// own resolved colors through `getComputedStyle`, composited where the palette uses alpha,
// so they are the pixels he actually gets rather than the values the stylesheet names.
// Nothing on this surface is declared exempt: an assignment's title, its state and the
// control that stops it are all text he is expected to read.
