// **THE FAILURE CARD, WHEN THE MODEL API IS WHAT FAILED** — `open-items.md` row 3.30,
// rendered by the REAL renderer under WebKit, the engine Tauri ships on macOS.
//
// The row's second and fifth answers reach the CEO here or they reach him nowhere. Before
// this suite existed the card said two fixed sentences for every failure:
//
//     I hit a snag mid-thought and had to stop — say the word and I'll pick it back up.
//     Everything I'd already written above is saved.
//
// The second is true about the TEXT and false about the whole — the session's working
// context is gone, and on 2026-09-03 five agents died having written nothing at all. And
// neither sentence can tell a `529` from a `429`, which are the two ends of "waiting is a
// plan" and "waiting is a plan with a known end".
//
// **THE BYTES ARE THE BACKEND'S, NOT THIS FILE'S.** Every sentence asserted below is
// scraped out of `crates/richos-core/src/upstream.rs` at run time by
// `lib/state-strings.js`'s Rust bridge — the same scrape `affordances.js` builds its state
// inventory from. Nothing here types a sentence, so a reworded `ceo_message()` moves this
// suite with it instead of leaving it green over copy the product no longer says.
//
// Run: node outage.js   (or `npm test` for every suite in this directory)

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// WHAT WAS HERE UNTIL 2026-09-05, and why a second copy of the arithmetic is worse than no
// check at all. This file carried its own `CONTRAST_PROBE`: forty lines of hand-rolled WCAG
// math and, under it, an `opaqueBehind(el)` that walked the node's ANCESTORS looking for the
// first opaque `background-color`. Three properties came with that, none of them stated:
//
//   1. AN ANCESTOR WALK IS NOT THE PAINT STACK. It cannot see a scrim, an overlay or any
//      sibling painted over the node, so it reports the comfortable ratio of a background
//      that is not the one the eye receives. `lib/contrast.js` resolves the background from
//      `document.elementsFromPoint` inside the text's own line box — the browser's real
//      stack — for exactly this reason, and its header says so.
//   2. A GRADIENT IS INVISIBLE TO IT. An element with `background-image` has
//      `background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0)`, so the walk stepped straight past it and measured
//      against something further up. The shared library REFUSES a gradient by name: a color
//      it cannot resolve is a failure to prove, never a pass.
//   3. IT FELL BACK TO WHITE. `return [255, 255, 255]` when nothing opaque was found — a
//      guess, reported as a measurement, in a file whose own header says the numbers are
//      "computed from the pixels the renderer actually produced, never eyeballed".
//
// It also parsed with `s.match(/[\d.]+/g)`, which turns `color(display-p3 1 0 0)` into
// numbers rather than refusing it, and used WCAG 2.0's published `0.03928` linearization
// threshold where the shared library uses the exact `0.04045`. Neither would have changed a
// verdict here today. That is the point: a second implementation that agrees today is a
// second implementation that will disagree silently later, and the disagreement will be in
// whichever copy nobody is testing.
//
// So the card is measured by the same probe that walks the whole shell, and this file makes
// no arithmetic claims of its own. What it still does itself is the TYPE SCALE — §15's 14px
// floor — because a font size is read, not computed, and there is nothing to get wrong.
