// THE FRONT DOOR, MEASURED WHERE THE OTHER SUITES COULD NOT SEE — audit-9 rows 1 and 3.
//
// ## WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: A GREEN HARNESS OVER A WINDOW THAT DID NOT DO IT
//
// The `ui1` slice (`2e377176`) closed audit-8 rows 3, 4, 5, 10, 11 and 13, every one of them
// against a green suite in this directory. `2e377176` IS in the candidate-.9 bundle — verified,
// not assumed:
//
//     $ git merge-base --is-ancestor 2e377176 794eac7f && echo IN     ->  IN
//     $ /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c Print .../RichOS.app/Contents/Info.plist | grep Commit
//         RichOSSourceCommit = 794eac7f3dfbab75567f3aa6cf723da289a7ea99
//
// and Ray then walked that bundle and reported two of those rows still open
// (`docs/verification/2026-09-18-nightly-1.2.0-nightly.20260918.3-onscreen-audit.md` §4). So the
// suites were measuring something the window does not do. The two reasons, one per row, are the
// reason this file is a file rather than three more checks bolted onto `home.js`:
//
// ### ROW 1 — THERE IS NO ACCESSIBILITY TREE ANYWHERE IN THIS HARNESS
//
// Ray reads the NATIVE tree (`System Events` -> `AXUIElement`). Nothing in this directory ever
// has. `control-names.js` says so in its own header — *"Playwright 1.61 ships no accessibility
// snapshot API, so this suite computes the name from the DOM"* — and that is exactly true;
// re-measured on the installed 1.61.1:
//
//     $ node -e "... const p = await b.newPage(); console.log(typeof p.accessibility)"
//     undefined
//
// So every accessibility claim in this directory has been a claim about the DOM. The DOM said
// `#home-door-cap` is `aria-hidden="true"` and that is what the native tree reported too, and
// the DOM had nothing at all to say about the node SITTING NEXT TO IT, which is the defect.
//
// `locator.ariaSnapshot()` is the nearest thing 1.61 does ship, and its visibility rule is the
// one that matters here — measured rather than read off the documentation:
//
//     <div style="opacity:0"><p>faded text</p></div><button>hi</button><div hidden><p>x</p></div>
//       ->  - paragraph: faded text
//           - button "hi"
//
// An `opacity: 0` subtree is IN, a `[hidden]` subtree is OUT. That is precisely the distinction
// `#home-loading.gone` falls the wrong side of, so this is the tool for row 1. It is an ARIA
// tree and not the platform's, and it is declared as one: what it cannot tell you is how
// VoiceOver renders the result. What it CAN tell you is the thing that was wrong.
//
// ### ROW 3 — `home.js` HAS NEVER READ THE LAUNCH KIND, AND `home.js`'s OWN SUITE PINNED THAT
//
// `home.js` check "a launch with NO curtain at all lands on the home screen" asserts
// `r.homeOpen && !r.homeHidden` and its comment says, in as many words, *"It is also what every
// reload, every crash-restart and every second window gets"*. A Dock restore IS a second
// window (`main.rs::reopen_window`), so the suite was holding the product to the behavior Ray
// then reported as a defect. A check cannot catch what it asserts.
//
// The native half of the front door — a real Escape through AppKit into a real WKWebView — is
// NOT here and cannot be: this harness injects keys into the page through the automation
// protocol, which is a path the shipped window does not have. That half is
// `scripts/front-door.test.sh`.
//
// ## CASES
//
//   A1  the faded loading layer is OUT of the accessibility tree once the picture is up
//   A2  positive control — while it is still up, its words ARE in the tree
//   A3  the door itself is a named control, and there is exactly one of it
//   B1  a second window does NOT land on the opening screen
//   B2  positive control — fresh, reload and crash-restart still land on it
//   B3  ...and the way back is intact: the logo brings the home screen up on a second window
//   C1  this suite actually checked something
//
// Run: node front-door.js   (or `npm test` for every suite in this directory)
