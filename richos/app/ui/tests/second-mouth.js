// **A MESSAGE HE DID NOT TYPE HERE STILL APPEARS HERE, AND IT APPEARS AT ONCE.**
//
// Ray's candidate .13 walk, defect R3
// (`docs/verification/2026-09-19-nightly-1.2.0-nightly.20260919.2-mac-and-android-audit.md`):
//
//     "He taps Send on his phone and the Mac thread shows nothing for about six seconds; then
//      his words and the whole answer appear together. The only sign in between is a small
//      amber dot on the thread's row in the sidebar."
//
//     tap -> first appearance on the Mac 5.68 s, measured twice (5.77 s and 5.68 s). At
//     2.99 s the thread body was unchanged and only the sidebar row carried a working dot.
//     Mac -> phone is 0.096 s, so the asymmetry is ~60x.
//
// # Why this window had nothing to draw
//
// Every event in the §13 family is about RICH — his prose, his machinery, his workers, the
// state of the turn answering. The CEO's own sentence reached this screen by being DRAWN HERE
// optimistically the moment he pressed Enter (`addPendingUserMessage`), and reached it again
// on a reload as `TimelineItem::UserMessage`. Both assume he typed it HERE. His phone is a
// second mouth and makes that assumption false, so his message waited for `turn-completed` to
// reload the thread — which is why it arrived in the same frame as the finished answer.
//
// `rich://ceo-message` is the event that fixes it. It has existed in `live.rs` since
// `2c95c27d`; what was missing was (a) the spine emitting it for a message that came in off
// the intake log rather than through `accept_prompt`, and (b) this window listening for it.
//
// # What this file drives, and why it is not a mock of the fix
//
// The window is handed the EXACT event sequence the spine emits for a phone message —
// `turn-status: queued`, `rich://ceo-message`, `turn-status: working`, then Rich's prose —
// through the same `RichBridge.listen` callbacks `main.js` registered, with NO composer
// interaction, because he did not type here. That is the whole of what makes a phone message
// different from a desk one, and it is reproduced rather than described.
//
// Run: node second-mouth.js   (or `npm test` for every suite in this directory)
