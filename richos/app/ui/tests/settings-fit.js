// **THE SETTINGS PANEL FITS THE WINDOW THE APP RESTORES ITSELF TO** — candidate-.4 audit,
// defect 3.
//
// `docs/verification/2026-09-17-nightly-1.2.0-20260917.4-onscreen-audit.md` §4:
//
//   *"The window is 1024x700 at (664,108) — the app's own minimum, restored by the app. The
//    Settings panel measures: menu 'Settings' size 267,738 -> bottom edge at y=940; window
//    size 1024,700 -> bottom edge at y=808. 132 pt of the panel hangs below the window. It does
//    not scroll ... Below the edge are the technical reason, the update-server address, and the
//    'Bust a bug!' button — so from the default window a person cannot reach the control for
//    reporting a bug."*
//
// ## WHY THIS IS ITS OWN SUITE AND NOT A CHECK IN `appearance.js`
//
// `appearance.js` opens every one of its pages at **1400x950** and `ticker-wrap.js` at
// **1400x880**. The app's own minimum, and the size it restores itself to, is **1024x700**.
// Three of the candidate-.4 defects — the home picture, this panel, and the overlapped `CAPITAL`
// count — are all the same shape: something measured at a comfortable size and shipped to a
// smaller one. A suite that only ever opens a roomy window cannot see any of them.
//
// So the window size is the subject here, and every check states it.
//
// ## AND THE SURFACE IS THE HOME SCREEN, WHICH THIS HEADER SHOULD HAVE SAID FROM THE START
//
// `openMenu` sends the CURTAIN away and then clicks the button. It does not call `leaveHome`,
// so the surface in front of every check in this file is the home screen, not a thread. That
// has always been true here and cost nothing while the settings button had one position on
// every screen. It stopped costing nothing on 2026-09-19, when the CEO gave the button two —
// centered on the regular screens, back in the corner on the home screen and the held opening
// screen — at which point the anchor this suite pins is a number that only means something once
// the surface is named. It is named here, and again beside the assertion.
//
// Left ON the home screen deliberately, rather than made to leave it. Measured at 1024x700,
// dark, with the bound lifted so the panel reports its natural height:
//
//     home screen   12 rows, 620px natural, no theme row   against a 616px bound
//     a thread      13 rows, 658px natural, theme row      against a 628px bound
//
// §15 clamps this surface dark and `settings-button.js` OMITS the theme row rather than
// disabling it, which is the missing row. Both surfaces overflow their bound and both therefore
// scroll — this one by 4px, a thread by 30px — so this file is measuring the case it exists for
// on either, and it is measuring it on the surface the audited window was audited from. Moving
// it would be a change of subject, not an improvement.
//
// ## THE PAIR
//
// A negative control that reproduces Ray's geometry, and the positive control the brief asks
// for. The panel's natural height depends on state — 9 rows measure 523px, and his 738px is the
// same panel with the Updates block opened on an error — so the reproduction GROWS the panel to
// his measured 738px deterministically rather than hoping the fixture renders the same state.
//
// Run: node settings-fit.js   (or `npm test` for every suite in this directory)
