// **THE FIRST-RUN COMPANY SHEET, AND THE WAY OUT OF IT** — candidate-.2 defect #5.
//
// `docs/verification/2026-09-17-nightly-1.2.0-20260917.2-onscreen-audit-2.md` §4:
//
//   *"#5 — the explanatory paragraph captions the wrong button. Ran it on screen. On the
//    company sheet, 'Not now is fine. I'll leave the message box switched off until you pick
//    one, and the button to do it stays right there.' sits flush against the bottom edge of
//    Add this company, with zero gap, while the Not now button it describes is below it with
//    normal spacing. Every other paragraph on these sheets has clear spacing. Expected: the
//    sentence sits with the control it explains."*
//
// ## PROXIMITY IS A MEASUREMENT, NOT A JUDGMENT
//
// "Sits with the control it explains" is checkable without anybody's taste in it: the gap
// above the sentence and the gap below it are two numbers, and the sentence belongs to
// whichever is smaller. Before the fix those numbers were **-4px above and 12px below** — the
// sentence overlapped the bottom edge of the button it does NOT describe and stood clear of
// the one it does. That is not a close call in either direction.
//
// ## AND THE SECOND FINDING, WHICH THE WALK DID NOT SEE
//
// Measuring the first one turned up a worse one in the same sheet. With six companies in the
// registry the panel is 843px tall, `.overlay`'s `padding-top: 12vh` starts it at 108px in a
// 900px window, and the "Not now" button landed at y=901.8 with `overflow: hidden` above it
// and nothing to scroll. The control D5 added to end a wall was itself unreachable — Playwright
// refused to click it sixty times over thirty seconds ("element is outside of the viewport"),
// which is a fair model of a person who cannot reach it either. The walk could not have seen
// it: the CEO's own first launch has an EMPTY registry, so his sheet is shorter. Anybody who
// has added companies has the taller one.
//
// The sheet now clamps to `calc(88vh - 24px)` and scrolls inside that. What is NOT done here,
// and is the better shape if this sheet grows again: bounding the COMPANY LIST, which is the
// only part of the panel whose height is a function of how much a person has, so that the
// sheet's frame — its question and its way out — never moves. The content is 865px at both
// sizes measured (title 20, note 70, list 238, add-a-company form 340, deferral 114); with the
// list at zero it would still be 627px and still not fit at 1024x700, so bounding the list is
// an improvement and not the fix, and it is left undone rather than landed untested.
//
// Run: node first-run-sheet.js   (or `npm test` for every suite in this directory)
