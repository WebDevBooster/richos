// THE COMPOSER'S SCROLLBAR — dev-walk audit N1, 2026-09-17.
//
// Quoted verbatim from `docs/verification/2026-09-17-main-aa0165cc-dev-walk-audit.md`:
// "A white native scrollbar is jammed into the right end of the message box, through its
// rounded corner and its focus ring, on an EMPTY box with nothing to scroll. Both themes."
//
// Two things are true about that one symptom, and this suite holds them apart rather than
// conflating them — SAID PLAINLY, because one is confirmed and the other is a hypothesis
// this harness could not fully settle (see mutation 1's note at the foot of the file):
//
//   1. HYPOTHESIS, NOT CONFIRMED HERE: `<textarea rows="1">`'s own intrinsic-height
//      algorithm not agreeing with the `line-height: 1.5` `style.css` sets on it, so an
//      empty box's `scrollHeight` reads a few px taller than its `clientHeight`. `#input`
//      now carries an explicit `height` derived from the same padding/line-height the
//      stylesheet already declares, in the same units, so the two can never disagree the
//      way the attribute and the stylesheet might have. Check 1 asserts the resulting
//      invariant (no overflow on an empty box, in both themes) — but every mutation tried
//      against it in THIS engine left `scrollHeight === clientHeight` regardless, so the
//      check could not be proven able to fail for this specific cause; it may be catching a
//      real class of bug, or the real cause may live in a native macOS scrollbar preference
//      this harness cannot reproduce at all.
//   2. CONFIRMED, BOTH DIRECTIONS: a NATIVE, OS-drawn scrollbar is a platform widget WebKit
//      does not clip to the scrolling element's own `border-radius` — only an ANCESTOR's
//      `overflow: hidden` does, which is exactly why "through its rounded corner" is
//      possible at all regardless of cause 1. So the border, radius, fill and focus ring
//      moved off `#input` and onto a new, never-scrolling wrapper, `#input-shell`; `#input`
//      is the plain field inside it. Checks 2 and 3 are this half, and both were proven able
//      to fail against the shipped shape (mutation log, below).
//
// Check 1's mutation could not be reproduced RED; checks 2 and 3 were, against the real
// shipped source, in this session — see the mutation log at the foot of the file.
//
// Run: node composer-scroll.js   (or `npm test` for every suite in this directory)

// =========================================================================================
// THE MUTATIONS — every check above was run RED once, against the shipped defect
// =========================================================================================
//
//  1  UNABLE TO TURN RED, AND SAID PLAINLY RATHER THAN LEFT UNTESTED. Three different
//     mutations were tried against `#input`'s `height`/`line-height` — unsetting `height`
//     entirely (the shipped, pre-fix shape), raising `line-height` to 1.8 while leaving
//     `height` at its old 1.5em value, and forcing `height: 20px` well under one line — and
//     this Playwright-bundled WebKit reported `scrollHeight === clientHeight` in EVERY case,
//     never the mismatch the audit's live macOS WKWebView actually showed. The empirical
//     finding: THIS engine appears to lay out a `rows="1"` textarea's box from its own
//     internal per-row metrics rather than from the literal CSS `height`, so scrollHeight
//     and clientHeight are read off the SAME recomputed number regardless of what height is
//     declared — which means the exact "empty box, few-px phantom overflow" arithmetic this
//     check was written to catch may be a property of the native macOS WKWebView's
//     scrollbar preference (Show scrollbars: Always) rather than of the DOM box model at
//     all, and this harness cannot reproduce a system-level scrollbar-visibility setting.
//     Check 1 therefore stands as an ASSERTED INVARIANT — never true if it ever stops
//     holding — rather than a proven regression test, and that distinction is the reason
//     this entry exists instead of a fabricated RED run.
//  2  style.css: move `border`/`border-radius` back onto `#input` (the shipped defect's
//     shape) -> check 2 fails: "the textarea carries a border of its own (4px)".
//  3  style.css: change `#input-shell:focus-within`'s `border-color` from `var(--accent)`
//     to `var(--line-control)` (a border that no longer visibly changes on focus) -> check 3
//     fails: "the shell's border did not change color on focus — the audit's gold focus
//     ring never actually rings the box".
//
// Mutations 2 and 3 were run against the actual shipped source in this session and their
// FAIL output above is copied verbatim from that run.
