// **THE FAILURE CARD, WHEN THE FAILURE IS LOCAL** — the 2026-09-17 nightly's D2, rendered
// by the REAL renderer under WebKit, the engine Tauri ships on macOS.
//
// `docs/verification/2026-09-17-nightly-1.2.0-20260917.1-onscreen-audit.md` §D2. The
// published nightly held this in its own ledger:
//
//     "reason":"cognition protocol: \"Not logged in · Please run /login\""
//
// and showed him this:
//
//     Stopped after 1s
//     I hit a snag mid-thought and had to stop — say the word and I'll pick it back up.
//     Everything I'd already written above is saved.
//     [Pick it back up]
//
// Three untruths in four lines: a permanent condition called a passing hiccup, a promise
// about saved work when nothing had been written, and a retry control for a state no number
// of presses can clear. This suite makes each one unreachable on the surface the CEO sees.
//
// **THE BYTES ARE THE BACKEND'S, NOT THIS FILE'S.** Every sentence asserted below is scraped
// out of `crates/richos-core/src/interruption.rs` at run time by `lib/state-strings.js` —
// the same scrape `outage.js` and `affordances.js` use. Nothing here types a sentence, so a
// reworded `ceo_message()` moves this suite with it instead of leaving it green over copy
// the product no longer says.
//
// Run: node interruption.js   (or `npm test` for every suite in this directory)
