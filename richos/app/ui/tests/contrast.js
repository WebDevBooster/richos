// THE CONTRAST FLOOR, ENFORCED — the standing rule in `CLAUDE.md` §"Contrast — WCAG AA,
// ALWAYS, BOTH THEMES", turned from a sentence into something that can fail.
//
// The CEO's order was: stop having to say this. It was answered by writing the rule into
// `CLAUDE.md` and into fifteen agent definitions, which is exactly the shape of answer that
// does not work — a rule written into a prompt is a request, and a request is complied with
// at whatever rate people comply with requests. The four light-mode failures that provoked
// the order (2.95, 2.95, 3.15, 3.60 against a floor of 4.5) were each produced by someone
// who had already been told the rule and who looked at the result and thought it looked
// fine. An eye adapts to the palette it has been staring at. Arithmetic does not.
//
// So this suite computes the ratio. Every visible run of text on the shipping shell, every
// non-text indicator, against the colours actually painted behind it, in both themes.
//
// THE EXEMPTION IS THE LOAD-BEARING PART, and getting it wrong is how this file dies. The
// standing rule exempts text deliberately not meant to be read closely — a privacy notice,
// legal boilerplate, fine print — and nothing else. A checker that ignored that would flag
// the whole of any legal footer, and a checker that flags what everybody already decided is
// fine gets muted inside a week; a muted checker's green is worse than no checker, because
// it converts "nobody looked" into "something looked and it was fine". So the exemption is
// MACHINE-READABLE: `data-contrast-exempt="<why this text is not meant to be read closely>"`
// in the shipped markup. A declared exemption passes AND IS PRINTED, with its reason, in the
// report of every run. An undeclared one fails. That inverts the CEO's declaration
// requirement into the enforcement mechanism: the only way to be excused is to say so where
// a reviewer reads it, and the count of exemptions becomes a number that can be watched for
// creep — check 12 prints it.
//
// AN UNRESOLVABLE COLOUR IS A FAILURE TO PROVE, NEVER A PASS. Gradients, blend modes,
// `background-clip: text`, an unparseable colour notation, a panel painted over the node:
// each one is a place a lazy implementation returns "fine". Check 7 introduces one of each
// into a live page and asserts the walk refuses all of them.
//
// WHAT THIS GATE COVERS AND WHAT IT CANNOT — the honest boundary, asserted rather than
// promised:
//
//   COVERS   the driven surfaces below — twenty-four of them as this is written, and the
//            number is printed by every run rather than quoted here, because a count in a
//            comment is the thing that goes stale first. This header said "thirteen" over a
//            list of twenty-one until 2026-09-05. Both themes, text, and the bounded
//            non-text-indicator subset check 3 defines. The three `updates-*` surfaces are
//            also the first drivers to reach the UNIVERSAL settings menu at all — the
//            `settings` surface drives the RAIL's preferences popover, which is a different
//            menu — and their first run found a shipped 1.24:1 indicator in it. The opening screen is WALKED and its one HTML line comes back
//            UNPROVABLE — see `knownUnresolvable` in contrast-debt.json. That is a stated
//            blind spot with a name on it, which is not the same thing as coverage.
//   COVERS   and this is check 10c's doing rather than anyone's diligence: `entity-view`,
//            `thread-menu` and `techy-nothing-recorded`. All three are panels the shipped
//            shell declares, all three carry text the CEO reads, all three are reachable in
//            a browser with nothing stubbed, and no driver opened any of them. 10c derives
//            the panel inventory from the shell and refuses an unwalked panel that nobody
//            wrote down; on the day it landed it named ten, and seven of those are honest
//            gaps now recorded in `contrast-debt.json`'s `unwalkedPanels` with their reasons.
//   CANNOT   `<canvas>` — no computed style to read. The shipping shell contains none, and
//            check 14 asserts that, so the day one lands the assertion is what tells you.
//            The round-7 and round-8.1 material studies ARE canvas-heavy and NOTHING here
//            says anything about them. "We have a contrast check now" does not cover canvas.
//   CANNOT   SVG `fill`/`stroke`. The opening screen is almost entirely SVG — check 10
//            counts what it therefore does not measure and prints the number.
//   CANNOT   states no driver reaches: the voice panel MID-LISTEN, the drill-down slideover,
//            the between-turns strip, streaming mid-flight. Named, not hidden.
//   COVERS   and this one was in that CANNOT list until 2026-09-17: the voice panel's SPEECH-MODEL
//            rows. The reason it was excluded — "reaching it needs a live audio device" — was
//            true of every row the panel had. It is not true of these three: the offer, the
//            transfer and the refusal all paint with no microphone opened, on a machine that
//            cannot transcribe, which is the entire point of them. Three drivers walk them, so
//            the ratios in `style.css`'s own comment block are now arithmetic this gate performs
//            rather than arithmetic an engineer performed once.
//
// A NOTE ON THE DEBT LEDGER, because it is the one thing here that could be mistaken for a
// weakened threshold. It is not. The threshold is 4.5/3.0 and never moves; every failure is
// computed, named and printed with its ratio on every run. `contrast-debt.json` records what
// the shipping app was ALREADY failing the day the gate was built, so that a red run means
// "someone made this worse today" rather than "this repository has old debt", which is the
// signal a developer learns to ignore. A signature not in the ledger fails. A signature in
// the ledger whose ratio got worse fails. The ledger's size is capped at what it was
// committed with, so it can only shrink.
//
// EVERY CHECK HERE WAS RUN RED ONCE by breaking the shipped source; the mutations are listed
// against their check numbers at the bottom of this file.

/// not.
///
/// MEASURED at `934f127` with 120 ms on each bridge call, which is this suite's own knob above:
/// the `assignment-running` walk ran against a shell showing the PREVIOUS thread — the stage
/// header read "Harbor Analytics / Running" rather than "Northwind Traders / Q4 hiring", and

/// THE FLOOR IS WHAT CAUGHT IT, AND ONLY JUST. Run 34010691469 reported 428 across both themes
/// against a floor of 436 — one theme raced, one did not. Had both cleared the floor the suite
/// would have reported a clean contrast sweep of `assignment-running` having walked a

/// "nobody checked" but "somebody checked and it was fine".

/// and the thread's own turns, all three — rather than on a timeout somebody widened.
/// WAIT FOR THE SHELL TO HAVE FINISHED ARRIVING, rather than for 300 ms.
///

  // DRIVE THE APP'S OWN THEME, NOT THE OS PREFERENCE — and this is the whole reason this
  // suite kept meaning something on the day dark mode landed.
  //
  // Until 2026-08-31 the app shipped ONE palette, so `colorScheme` on the page was a
  // reasonable stand-in for "the other theme": there was no other theme, and check 10 said
  // so out loud. Now there are two, and which one paints is a STORED PREFERENCE in
  // `config.rs` applied as `:root[data-theme="light"]` — never `@media (prefers-color-scheme:
  // dark)`, which appears nowhere in the shipped CSS and is what check 10 counts.
  //
  // THE SENTENCE THAT USED TO BE HERE WAS "An OS preference decides NOTHING about which
  // palette this app paints", AND SINCE §63 (2026-09-19) IT IS FALSE. The stored preference
  // can now BE `system`, which is the default a fresh install gets, and `theme-boot.js`
  // resolves it against `prefers-color-scheme` on every change. The OS decides the palette
  // whenever the user has not — which is most users, most of the time. What is still true,
  // and is the part this seeding depends on, is that the OS cannot OVERRULE a preference he
  // set: seed `light` or `dark` here and `colorScheme` is inert, whatever it says.
  //
  // So had this line stayed as it was, both "themes" would have walked the DARK palette,
  // the light half of every check above would have been a re-run of the dark half, and the
  // suite would have reported a clean sweep of both themes while never once measuring light
  // mode — the precise failure mode check 10 was written to catch, arriving through the
  // door check 10 was not watching. `colorScheme` is still passed, because `system` resolves
  // against it and a theme-independent element that DID respond to the OS should still be
  // seen; but the app's own preference is what is set here.
  //
  // It is seeded into `localStorage` in an init script, which is to say through the exact
  // mirror `theme-boot.js` reads before first paint. Setting `data-theme` after load would
  // measure a state the shipping app never actually boots into.
  // BOTH the mirror and the STORE, and the second one is the one that decides. Seeding
  // `richos-theme` alone does not work and finding out why is worth the two lines: the
  // mirror is a cache, `syncAppearanceFromBackend` reconciles it against the backend at
  // init, and the BACKEND WINS — so a mirror-only seed is overwritten by the store's answer
  // a few hundred milliseconds after boot, and the walk measures the store's theme while
  // claiming the seed's. That is the product behaving exactly as designed. The test has to

      // in full and report 0 new and 0 worsened; the panels' own contribution over the shell
      // was +10 and +4 measured nodes on 2026-09-06 and is +10 and +4 today. Nothing about
      // them changed. Their floors had two nodes of slack and the shell took six.
      //
      // The other 25 survived on luck rather than design, and the spread proves nobody ever
      // chose a margin: slack ran from 2 nodes on the floors set that week to 208 on
      // `search`, and `opening-screen` sat at 0 of 228 against an actual 0 of 412 — a floor
      // 184 nodes below the thing it was guarding, which could not have caught anything.

      // the SHELL lost in the same run before comparing. Shrink only: a shell that grows

  // 16c — A FOCUS RING IS A DIFFERENT PAINT FROM THE CONTROL IT RINGS
  //
  // THE SHIPPED DEFECT, AND IT IS ON THE ONE SCREEN A CUSTOMER CANNOT GET PAST.
  // `.desk-btn--confirm` fills itself with `--accent` and `.desk-btn:focus-visible` drew its
  // ring in `--accent`:
  //
  //     dark   #c2a35c ring on #c2a35c fill    1.00:1
  //     light  #9c7c34 ring on #9c7c34 fill    1.00:1
  //
  // `Set it up`, focused, differed from `Set it up`, unfocused, by a 1px hairline of panel.
  //
  // WHY THE SURFACE WALK ABOVE COULD NOT SEE IT, which is the same shape as 16 and 16b: the
  // walk measures what is PAINTED AT REST. A focus ring exists only while a control has the
  // keyboard, so no resting frame in this suite has ever contained one. This check focuses
  // the control first, which is the whole of what it adds.
  //
  // AND THE NOTE IN `style.css` WAS NOT WRONG, WHICH IS THE INSTRUCTIVE PART. It quotes 6.36:1
  // dark and 3.83:1 light for that ring and both are correct — against the PANEL. A filled
  // button has a second neighbor the plain one does not: its own fill. A ratio is never a
  // property of a color, only of a pair, and the pair that was never computed is the one the
  // CEO was looking at.
  //
  // THE RULE, and it is derived rather than a list: a focused control's ring must clear 3:1
  // against the paint on EACH SIDE of it — its own fill on the inside, whatever is behind the
  // control on the outside. A two-tone ring answers each side with its own band, so the inner
  // band (a `box-shadow` of 0 blur filling the `outline-offset` gap) is measured against the
  // fill and the outline against the ground, plus the boundary between the two.
  //
  // THE SWEEP IS WHAT MAKES IT A FLOOR. Every visible focusable control in an ordinary window
  // is focused and measured, so the next filled button is covered the day it is written and
  // nobody has to remember this.

    // an EMPTY between-turn lane — `mock.js` says so where it defines them: "`acme` has

    // and every label Ray measured was outside the walk. That is not a bug in that surface —
    // it is the right fixture for the empty state — it is a hole where the full state should
    // also be walked.
    //
    // REASON TWO, AND THE ONE WORTH KEEPING: THE DECLARED COLOR PASSED AND THE PAINTED GLYPH

// RUN RED — the mutation that made each check fail, and what went red with it
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Twenty-two runs, one edit each, the file restored from a copy taken before the edit
// whether the run passed or failed, and `git status` clean at the end. Full transcript with
// the failure text of every run: `docs/verification/contrast-gate-2026-08-30/`.
//
// TWO OF THEM DID NOT GO RED THE FIRST TIME AND ARE RECORDED AS SUCH, in the transcript and
// here. A mutation that turns nothing red proves nothing, and quietly replacing it with one
// that works is how a run-red list becomes decoration.
//
//  1   lib/contrast.js `srgbToLinear`: `return v` instead of the piecewise gamma expansion
//        -> #777777 on white reads 2.03:1 where WebAIM publishes 4.48. Also reds 3, 8 and
//           every surface: the whole gate is built on this function
//  2   lib/contrast.js `pageScript`: drop `round2` from the math shipped into the page
//        -> `M.round2 is not a function` in WebKit. The two runtimes are proven to be one
//           source by the fact that removing it from one removes it from both
//  3   lib/contrast.js `thresholdFor`: `return NORMAL` unconditionally
//        -> the 24px node, the 19px-bold node and the declared indicator all fail at 4.5
//  3b  lib/contrast.js `isLargeText`: bold boundary 18px instead of 18.66px
//        -> 18.65px/700 counts as large text
//  4   lib/contrast.js the text loop: `if (true) { out.nodesPassed++; continue; }`
//        -> the planted 2.17:1 caption produces no failure at all
//  4b  lib/contrast.js: file the failure with `selector: "(a node)"`
//        -> the failure is counted and the node is not named, which is the report nobody
//           can act on
//  5   lib/contrast.js: honour a declared exemption without filing it into `out.exempt`
//        -> it passes SILENTLY, which is the exact failure mode the mechanism exists to
//           prevent: an excuse nobody sees is not a declaration
//  5b  lib/contrast.js `exemptionFor`: `hasAttribute` on the node instead of `closest`
//        -> the anchor inside the privacy notice is not covered by the notice's exemption
//  6   lib/contrast.js `MIN_REASON = 0`
//        -> `data-contrast-exempt=""` becomes a working mute button
//  7   lib/contrast.js `resolveBackground`: drop the `backgroundImage !== "none"` guard
//        -> text over a black-to-white gradient resolves to the paper behind it and passes
//  7b  lib/contrast.js: `continue` past an unprovable node without filing it anywhere
//        -> four unprovable nodes vanish from the report and the run stays green
//  8   lib/contrast.js `stackFor`: return the chain without `over`
//        -> the 12% sheet is ignored and #767676 reads 4.54:1 instead of the 4.25:1 the eye
//           gets — a node that passes on paper and fails on screen
//  9   style.css `--ink-faint: #a5a297` -> `#8f8c81`
//        -> 20 NEW pairings on the shell alone, named with their ratios; all nine driven
//           surfaces red
//  9b  style.css: `.nav-thread-title { display: none }`
//        -> the shell measures 66 nodes against a floor of 80. The surface still renders and
//           has nothing wrong with what is left, which is precisely the run that would
//           otherwise read as an improvement
//  10  style.css gains a real `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` block AND the suite
// 10b  drop three entries from SURFACES -> check 10b. A short inventory that still reported
//      its findings is a clean bill of health over whatever it happened to reach; run.js's
//      declared-vs-observed gate cannot see it, because the suite would run every check it
//      declares. Also: unsetting RICHOS_UI_TESTS_LEDGER changes NOTHING here, which is the
//      point of the check and was verified by running it both ways.
//      stops passing `colorScheme` to `newPage`
//        -> "1 dark block(s) are shipped, but the dark run produced the identical palette —
//           the emulation is not reaching them, so the dark half of every check above is a
//           fiction". This is the mutation that matters most for check 10: the branch that
//           reports today's single-theme reality is easy, and the one that catches a dark
//           mode nobody is actually testing is the one worth proving
//      theme-boot.js's pre-paint default `|| "system"` -> `|| "dark"`, with mock.js and
//      `Theme::default()` moved to match
//        -> "an install with NO stored preference must take its lighting from the operating
//           system — CEO ruling §63. It opened dark under a light OS and dark under a dark
//           one". The fresh-install walk at the foot of check 10 asserted `"dark"` under one
//           OS until 2026-09-19; one OS can only half-test a rule about following the OS,
//           and the half it tested was the half that agreed with the old default
// 10c  NOT A MUTATION — IT RAN RED ON THE SHIPPED SOURCE, first time, which is a stronger
//      result than a mutation and is why it exists. The panel probe named TEN panels in
//      `index.html` that no driver opened, and three of them were not gaps at all:
//      `#entity-view` (§3.5's company overview), `#thread-menu` (rename/pin/archive) and
//      `#techy-state`'s nothing-recorded arm. Each carries text the CEO reads, each is
//      reachable in a browser with nothing stubbed, and this file had said nothing about any
//      of them. Drivers were written; all three walk clean in both themes (110, 98 and 116
//      nodes measured, 0 new, 0 worsened). The remaining seven are in `unwalkedPanels` with
//      their reasons. The comparator is ALSO proven able to fail inside the check itself:
//      one declaration is dropped from a COPY of the ledger and the check asserts the
//      comparator names exactly that panel — 10b's own comment records what happens when a
//      comparator is built out of the single set it is checking.
//  11  index.html: a painted, click-through curtain (`pointer-events: none`,
//      `rgba(0,0,0,0.6)`, z-index 300) left over the whole app
//        -> every node on every surface is filed obscured and measured nowhere, and check 11
//           names them. A blunt mutation — it reds fifteen checks — and it is the honest one:
//           the bucket only becomes a hiding place when something covers everything.
//  11  FIRST ATTEMPT, INERT, RECORDED AS SUCH: `stackFor`'s modal branch changed to
//      `if (modal)`, dropping the `!modal.contains(el)` half. Nothing went red. The loop it
//      sits in only runs over elements painted ABOVE the node, and a desk card inside the
//      panel has none, so the mutated line was never reached. It proves nothing about check
//      11 and is not counted as a run.
//  11b NOT A MUTATION FIRST — THE SHIPPED SOURCE WAS ALREADY UNMEASURED. `lib/contrast.js`
//      collected `nodeType === 3` children, and a pseudo-element is not a node, so
//      `style.css:3787`'s `.setbtn::after { content: "Settings" }` — the tooltip on the
//      settings button §15 puts on EVERY screen — was rendered text that no check in this
//      directory had ever measured, and it was not on the library header's "WHAT IT DOES
//      NOT SEE" list either, so it was not even a known gap. Measured now, on its own
//      `settings-tooltip` surface, in both themes:
//
//          dark   #979faf on #182440  5.78:1  at 16px, floor 4.5:1
//          light  #595e66 on #fdfcf8  6.38:1  at 16px, floor 4.5:1
//
//      Independently re-derived by hand before the run rather than read off it:
//      `--ink-soft` dark is `rgba(223,228,238,0.64)` over `--surface: var(--card) = #182440`,
//      which composites to rgb(151.4,158.9,175.4) and gives 5.78; light is
//      `rgba(12,19,34,0.68)` over `#fdfcf8`, composites to rgb(89.1,93.6,102.5), 6.38. Both
//      agree with WebKit to the second decimal. The surface is CLEAN — and nothing could
//      have told you that before today.
//  11b(i)  DRIVER MUTATION — `p.hover(".setbtn")` -> `p.hover("#composer-input")` -> check
//      11b. `style.css:3787 = "Settings" was measured in no theme ... the surfaces that
//      report it hidden are: shell/light button#set-btn::after (cumulative opacity 0)`.
//      This is the one that matters: it proves `hidden` is NAMED rather than skipped, so a
//      driver that stops reaching the hover state fails instead of quietly measuring less.
//  11b(ii) SOURCE MUTATION — a `content: "Draft — do not ship"` on a selector nothing
//      matches, appended to `style.css` -> check 11b: `authored content string(s) that NO
//      walk in this suite ever encountered — actual ["style.css:4619 = \"Draft — do not
//      ship\""]`. The other direction of the join, and the one that would catch authored
//      text arriving in a stylesheet no gate opens.
//  12  index.html: `data-contrast-exempt="x"` on `#rail-company`
//        -> rejected by file and by reason for having nothing to say
//  12b index.html: `data-contrast-exempt="chrome, nobody reads the company name"` against
//      an `exemptionCap` of 0
//        -> "1 exemptions are declared; the ledger's cap is 0. Raise the cap deliberately,
//           in the same commit that adds the exemption, so the growth is a decision."
//  13  contrast-debt.json `cap`: 52 with 53 signatures in the file
//        -> the ledger is refused as a place to put new work
//  13b style.css: `.desk-card-target { background-image: linear-gradient(#fff,#fff) }`
//        -> a real caption on a real surface goes unprovable, and there is no ledger entry
//           absorbing it: "colour(s) ... that this gate cannot prove, and that nobody has
//           written down". Also reds 9.corrections
//  13b FIRST ATTEMPT, ANCHOR MISSED: `.desk-card-target {` does not appear in style.css —
//      the rule is written `.desk-card-target,` as the head of a selector list. The driver
//      refused to proceed rather than editing something else, which is the behaviour that
//      makes an anchor miss a recorded non-run instead of a silent one.
//  14  index.html: `<canvas width=10 height=10>` inside the conversation pane
//        -> "a <canvas> appeared on a walked surface ... a green run here must not be read
//           as covering it"
//  15  index.html: `<svg><text x=0 y=9>hi</text></svg>` inside the conversation pane
//        -> 20 svg text nodes across the walks, named as unmeasured rather than passed over
// 16c  style.css: delete the `.desk-btn--confirm:focus-visible` rule
//        -> "light: #setup-go's ring touches its own fill at 1:1 (#9c7c34 on #9c7c34), under
//           the 3:1 floor a non-text indicator owes." RUN, not reasoned about: the rule was
//           taken out, `node contrast.js` exited 1 on exactly that line, and it was put back.
// 16d  style.css: `box-shadow: 0 2px 0 2px var(--on-gold)` on the same rule (a shadow with
//      an OFFSET is not a ring)
//        -> the inner band is no longer counted, and the check falls back to the outline
//           against the fill: 1.00:1 again
