// TWO LIGHTINGS, ONE TYPE KNOB, AND THE PERSON AT THE FOOT OF THE RAIL.
//
// CEO rulings §14 and §15 (`richos-hq/wiki/ceo-decisions.md`), plus his correction to round
// 10.1. Five things are asserted here that nothing else in this directory can assert,
// because each of them is a claim about the SHIPPING shell rather than about a module:
//
//   1. SYSTEM IS THE DEFAULT (§63, 2026-09-19) — "the app should detect the user's system
//      preference for dark or light theme and system should be the default for a freshly
//      installed app" — AND IT IS THE DEFAULT AGAINST BOTH A LIGHT AND A DARK OPERATING
//      SYSTEM. That second clause is the whole check, and it is the clause this suite got
//      wrong for the three weeks it asserted the opposite: an app that resolved DARK by
//      default looks perfectly correct on a dark OS, passes every walk taken on one, and
//      hands a light-OS user a dark app. One OS setting can only ever half-test a rule
//      about following the OS, whichever half it is. Both walks, or neither proves
//      anything. Two more checks stand beside it, because §63 is two sentences and a
//      default is only the first: 1b is the OS flipping WHILE THE APP IS OPEN, and 1c is
//      "only if the user switches ... should the app remember that" — remembered across a
//      relaunch, and System reachable again afterwards.
//
//      §15's "a newly installed app opens dark" is not repealed. It moved: the splash and
//      the home screen are clamped dark and no switch reaches them, which is checks 4, 4b
//      and 5.
//   2. THE PREFERENCE IS DURABLE, and config.rs wins any disagreement with the pre-paint
//      mirror. The mirror exists only because an async read cannot decide the first frame;
//      the moment it can also DECIDE something, there are two places the answer lives.
//   3. THE OPENING SCREEN IS ALWAYS DARK AND THE BUTTON IS ON IT ANYWAY. §15's one permanent
//      exception and its floor, together, because they are only meaningful together: the
//      switch is the part that can be absent, and "Bust a bug" never is.
//   4. ONE STATE, TWO ENTRANCES, for the font size and for Techy Mode. A settings row and a
//      keyboard shortcut that agree most of the time are two states, and the failure is
//      silent.
//   5. THE FOOT OF THE RAIL IS HIS. Initials and a name — and when there is no name, an
//      honest empty state rather than an invented one or a "??".
//
// WHAT THIS SUITE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CLAIM. It runs in WebKit under Playwright, not in
// the Tauri shell, so it cannot prove that macOS itself leaves ⌘+ alone. What it CAN prove
// is the two halves that are actually ours: that the page handler calls `preventDefault`
// (check 8), and that `zoomHotkeysEnabled` is `false` in the shipped `tauri.conf.json`
// (check 9) — which is the flag that would otherwise inject a webview zoom polyfill on
// macOS and Linux and set WebView2's `IsZoomControlEnabled` on Windows. The remaining gap —
// a native menu item binding the same accelerator — is stated in the handoff rather than
// papered over. There is no menu in this app today and check 9 is what would notice one
// arriving with a zoom item attached.
//
// EVERY CHECK HERE WAS RUN RED ONCE by breaking the shipped source; the mutations are listed
// against their check numbers at the bottom of this file.
//
// Run: node appearance.js   (or `npm test` for every suite in this directory)
//      RICHOS_PLAYWRIGHT=/path/to/node_modules/playwright node appearance.js

/// red. So the wait is on a DIFFERENT fact from the assertion: that the call has completed.
/// What it wrote is still entirely open, and still asserted.
///
/// Recorded in a `finally`, so a command the mock does not implement (`set_splash_enabled` is

    // is the single most important place for it not to be, since §15's floor exists for
    // exactly the screen a first-run user is stuck on.
    //
    // CEO §62 NARROWED WHEN THAT BUTTON IS THERE AND NOT WHERE IT SITS WHEN IT IS: it is on
    // the opening screen only while the space key is holding the screen, and in that state it
    // still has to be above the curtain or it is not reachable at all. So this half of the
    // check is unchanged and is if anything load-bearing now — `tests/splash.js` check 25d
    // drives the live hit test in the held state, and this is the structural statement behind
    // it.
    //
    // So this half is structural: `.settings` must out-rank EVERY other z-index the app
    // ships, computed from the stylesheets rather than compared against a number typed
    // here. A new overlay that outranks it fails this check on the day it lands.

    // `splash.css` while `index.html` links a third — the 53 KB `home.css` — under a comment
    // claiming EVERY z-index the app ships. It is derived from `lib/ui-sources.js` now, and
    // widening it turned this check RED on the first run: `home.css` declares 340 against
    // `.settings`'s 300. That is the gate working, and what it found is below.

    // did — which is why `#bug-toast` was already excluded here. `.home-prefs` is the same
    // shape and was invisible to this check until `home.css` was: `settings-button.js`'s
    // `wireHome()` closes the menu and calls `home.open()`, and the dialog that opens is
    // `aria-modal` with its own Done control.

    // makes it owned, and the property is verified against the live DOM at the bottom of

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE MUTATIONS — every check above was run RED by breaking the shipped source. Each line
// is a mutation that was actually applied and the checks it actually turned red.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//  1   theme-boot.js: the pre-paint default `|| "system"` -> `|| "dark"` -> checks 1 and 1c.
//      This is the FIRST-FRAME half: under a light OS the launch flashes midnight blue and
//      then settles ivory, which no settled sample can see. It is why check 1 captures
//      `data-theme` from a MutationObserver installed before any page script rather than
//      reading it at the end. Since §63 the same mutation is caught a second way, by check
//      1's three-copies comparison, which reads the `|| "..."` straight off disk.
//  1b  mock.js: the store's shipped default `theme: "system"` -> `"dark"` -> checks 1, 17.
//      The SETTLED half, and the one that stands in for `Theme::default()` in config.rs.
//  1c  config.rs: `impl Default for Theme` -> `Theme::Dark` -> check 1 (its `rustDefaultTheme`
//      assertion), plus SIX tests in `cargo test -p richos-core`, named in the commit that
//      made this change. A browser cannot watch config.rs run, so the two gates are
//      complementary: this check catches the drift, the Rust tests catch the behavior.
//  1d  theme-boot.js: `resolved()`'s `if (pref === "system")` -> `if (true)`, so the OS is
//      consulted whatever he chose -> checks 1b ("his choice took"), 1c ("he switched to
//      dark"), 15 and 17. The app overrules a lighting he set by hand, which is §63's second
//      sentence failing in the one direction nobody thinks to look.
//
//      THE OBVIOUS MUTATION HERE IS A FALSE ONE, and it was written into this ledger before
//      it was run. Dropping the same `pref === "system"` guard from the `matchMedia` CHANGE
//      LISTENER instead leaves every check green — correctly, because `paint()` calls
//      `resolved()`, which guards it a second time, so removing the listener's guard costs
//      one redundant repaint and changes no answer. A ledger entry nobody executed is a
//      claim about coverage that the coverage does not support; this one was executed and
//      the first version of it is recorded here rather than quietly replaced.
//  1f  home.js: neuter the body of the `RichTheme.onChange` listener that RE-ASSERTS the
//      clamp (`if (state.open && !t.forcedDark) window.RichTheme.forceDark(true)`)
//        -> "§15's clamp: the home screen is dark under a light OS", expected "dark",
//           actual "light".
//
//      THE TWO OBVIOUS MUTATIONS HERE ARE BOTH FALSE, and each was run before this entry
//      was written. Deleting `RichTheme.forceDark(true)` from `show()` leaves every check
//      green, because this walk never RE-ENTERS the home screen — `tests/home.js` owns that
//      path. Deleting the one where the home screen first opens ALSO leaves every check
//      green, and that one is more interesting: the splash drops the clamp when the curtain
//      yields (`splash.js`, "Drop the always-dark clamp as the curtain goes"), so the
//      listener puts it straight back and masks the missing raise entirely. home.js's own
//      comment already says the re-assertion "is NOT belt and braces"; this is that sentence
//      measured from the outside. All three raises have to go before the light-OS home
//      screen turns ivory, and the listener is the one that decides.
//
//      And it fails under a LIGHT OS only. Under a dark OS the break is invisible, because
//      the preference resolves dark anyway — which is why this check walks both, and why it
//      could not have existed before §63: while the default was `dark`, the clamp and the
//      preference agreed on every surface, and either one alone made the walk look right.
//  1e  theme-boot.js: neuter the `mq.addEventListener("change", ...)` body -> check 1b
//      ("the OS went dark and the app did not"). The app detects the OS once, at boot, and
//      never again — which §63's word "detect" does not survive, and which no check that
//      only ever looks at boot could see.
//  2   main.js `syncAppearanceFromBackend`: drop `RichTheme.sync(durable)` -> check 2. The
//      mirror wins, and a preference set on another launch is silently lost.
//  3   settings-button.js `applyTheme`: `if (T.setTheme(pref)) saveTheme(pref)` ->
//      `T.setTheme(pref)` -> check 3. The theme changes on screen and dies at the next
//      launch: the failure a screenshot cannot see.
//  4   splash.js `start()`: delete `RichTheme.forceDark(true)` -> checks 4 and 5. A CEO on
//      light mode gets an ivory settings button floating on a midnight composition.
//  5   settings-button.js `buildMenu`: `if (!T.forcedDark())` -> always append the theme row
//      -> check 5. A theme switch on the one screen the ruling says no switch reaches.
//  6   splash.js `onInput`: drop the `.closest(".settings")` guard -> checks 5 and 6.
//      Opening the settings menu dismisses the curtain, so a bug report started from the
//      opening screen captures the shell instead — exactly what §15 says must never be
//      required.
//  7   style.css `.settings`: `z-index: 300` -> `100` -> check 7.
//      AND THIS ONE TAUGHT THE CHECK SOMETHING. The first version of check 7 was a hit test
//      on six surfaces, and this mutation did NOT turn it red: 100 still clears the app's
//      overlays (60/70), and the opening screen's curtain is `pointer-events: none`, so
//      `elementFromPoint` walks straight through it and returns the button whether the
//      button is above the curtain or buried under it. A hit test cannot speak for the one
//      surface that matters most. Check 7 gained a structural half — `.settings` must
//      out-rank every z-index the app ships, computed from the stylesheets — and the
//      mutation now fires. It also immediately found that `#bug-toast` is 301, which is
//      correct and is why the component's own layers are excluded from the comparison
//      rather than from the rule.
// 7b   NOT A MUTATION — THE SHIPPED SOURCE TURNED IT RED, 2026-09-05. The structural half
//      above read `style.css` and `splash.css` under a comment saying "every z-index the app
//      ships", while `index.html` links a THIRD stylesheet. Deriving the list from
//      `lib/ui-sources.js` put `home.css` in front of it for the first time and the check
//      failed on the spot: `.home-prefs` is `z-index: 340` against `.settings`'s 300.
//      That is a false positive of the RULE rather than a defect in the surface, and the
//      distinction is the whole of the fix. §15 requires the settings BUTTON to be
//      reachable from every screen; `.home-prefs` is the modal dialog the menu's own Home
//      screen row opens (`wireHome()` closes the menu, then calls `home.open()`), which is
//      the same relationship `#bug-toast` already had. So it joins the owned list — and the
//      ownership claim is now CHECKED rather than asserted, because a list that silences a
//      red check is a mute button unless it costs something to be on it: the run drives the
//      real menu and proves the Bust a bug control and the `#set-home-open` row are inside
//      `#set-menu`, and that the dialog that row opens is `role=dialog`, `aria-modal=true`
//      and carries its own Done. An unrelated overlay added to that list to quiet this check
//      would fail those three assertions instead.
//  8   settings-button.js `buildMenu`: append the Techy row before the font row -> check 8.
//      §15 says Text size sits "directly under the theme switch", and it is one line to get
//      wrong.
//  9   settings-button.js keydown: drop `e.preventDefault()` from the `+`/`=` arm -> check 9.
//      The scale still moves, so every other check stays green; what changes is that the
//      webview's own zoom is free to run underneath it.
//  10  settings-button.js `mount`: disable the `T.onChange(...)` subscription -> checks 3
//      and 10. The menu stops tracking state moved by anything but its own buttons.
//      THIS ONE ALSO CHANGED THE SOURCE. The first attempt was "delete the `paint()` inside
//      `stepFont`", and it did not turn anything red — because `T.stepScale` paints and
//      notifies, and this file is a subscriber, so that call was dead code that LOOKED
//      load-bearing. It is now deleted from `stepFont`, `resetFont` and `applyTheme`, and
//      the subscription is the single path, which is what makes check 10 able to fail.
//  11  main.js `requestTechyToggle`: drop the `if (!activeThreadId)` guard so every switch
//      writes `set_techy_default` directly -> checks 11 AND 12. This is the behavior check 11
//      used to ASSERT, before §7.1; the sheet never opens and the check waits 30s for it and
//      says so. It reds 12 as well, deliberately not hidden: 12's glyph half reaches the
//      technical view through the same door, because that door is the CEO's own path to it
//      and a second private entrance would be a check measuring a state he cannot reach.
//  11b NOT A MUTATION — THE SHIPPED SOURCE TURNED IT RED, and the CHECK was the thing that
//      was wrong. Check 11 was red on main from `68a91f0e` to 2026-09-18 asserting the
//      pre-§7.1 behavior (`page.waitForFunction: Timeout 10000ms exceeded` on a
//      `set_techy_default` that no longer happens inside a conversation). A red check whose
//      assertion has been overtaken by a ruling is not evidence of a defect; it is a check
//      that has stopped reading the product. The ruling is the specification, so the
//      assertion moved to it — and the branch that DOES still write the default (no
//      conversation open) is now asserted too, so the exception cannot rot into "it asks
//      sometimes".
//  12  style.css `.rail-company`: `1rem` -> `13px` -> check 12.
//  12b style.css `html`: `calc(16px * var(--app-font-scale, 1))` -> `16px` -> checks 9, 12,
//      13. Every size is still rem and NONE of them moves — the failure that looks most
//      like success.
//  12c NOT A MUTATION — THE SHIPPED SOURCE TURNED IT RED. Check 12 read `STYLE_CSS`, one
//      `readFileSync` of `style.css`, under a title claiming "every font-size in the shipped
//      CSS". `index.html` links four stylesheets. Deriving the list from
//      `lib/ui-sources.js` took it from 2 px font-sizes to 16, and one of the 14 it had
//      never been able to see was BELOW §15's floor:
//
//          §15: a font-size below the 14px floor in the shipped CSS
//          expected []
//          actual   ["splash.css:189 = 12px"]
//
//      `.splash-line` — the only text the opening screen has. It was dead: `splash.js` sets
//      the size inline from `LINE_SIZE` on every composition, so 18px is what paints and
//      `tests/splash.js` check 6 correctly measured 18px on the rendered frame. The
//      stylesheet had simply been wrong, and unreadably wrong, since the port, in a file no
//      gate opened. Fixed at `splash.css:198`, and check 12 now holds the declaration EQUAL
//      to `splash.js`'s `LINE_SIZE` so the two cannot drift apart again in silence.
//  12d home.css `#home-signals .sig .n`: add a second `font-size: 13px` -> check 12. The
//      count moves 13 -> 14 and the check names the file, the line and the value. Run
//      2026-09-05: `home.css has 14 px font-size(s), declared 13`. This is the proof that
//      the widened check can SEE the CEO's landing surface; the old one read `style.css` and
//      would have stayed green through it.
//  12e style.css `.tl-tech-title`: `0.875rem` -> `0.6875rem` (what it shipped as until
//      2026-09-18) -> check 12. The value the OLD check could not see, now named with the
//      pixels it resolves to. Run 2026-09-18:
//
//          §15: a font-size under the 14px floor with no declaration...
//          expected []
//          actual   ["style.css:4346  .tl-tech-title = 0.6875rem = 11px"]
//
//      This is the mutation that matters most here, because it is not hypothetical: it is
//      the shipped state of this stylesheet on `c8bcfe90`, and check 12 reported "smallest
//      14px" over it on every run for two weeks.
//  12f style.css `.nav-group-label`: delete `text-transform: uppercase` -> check 12. The
//      all-caps exemption loses its proof and the check refuses it by name — `expected
//      "uppercase" / actual ""` — rather than going on excusing an 11px label that is no
//      longer a micro-label. The mutation a designer would make without thinking about this
//      file at all.
//  12g appearance.js `BELOW_FLOOR`: re-declare `.nav-group-label` as `kind: "glyph"` ->
//      check 12, off the PAGE rather than the stylesheet: `.nav-group-label renders
//      "Northwind Traders"`, and six more. A false claim about what a node paints cannot be
//      made to stick by typing it in the exemption table.
//  13  style.css `.tl-prose`: `1.125rem` -> `1rem` -> check 13. Rich's answers back below
//      the CEO's stated 18px default.
//  14a tauri.conf.json: `"zoomHotkeysEnabled": true` -> check 14.
//  14b tauri.conf.json: delete the key entirely -> check 14. An absent key is an undecided
//      one even when its default happens to be the right answer.
//  15  style.css `.rail-wordmark`: `color: var(--ink)` -> `color: #dfe4ee` -> check 15. It
//      looks perfect in dark and stays near-white on the ivory rail in light.
//  15b index.html: un-hide `<span id="rail-company">` -> check 15. "My Company" is back in
//      the corner §15 gave to the wordmark.
//  16  main.js `renderUserIdentity`: initials `|| "??"` and a label of "User" -> check 16.
//      Both halves of the thing the CEO's correction explicitly forbids.
//  17  this file: seed every shot walk with `theme: "dark"` -> check 17. Twelve files claim
//      to show two themes while showing one.
//   4b NOT A MUTATION — THE SHIPPED HARNESS TURNED IT RED, AND THREE CHECKS WITH IT. The
//      hold this file used until 2026-09-06 replaced the EXPORTED `RichSplash.yieldNow` and
//      left `start()`'s ceiling armed over the internal one, so every walk that asked for a
//      held curtain had four seconds from `goto` to its last assertion and said so nowhere.
//      Reproduced on this machine at `934f127` by giving the ORIGINAL file 3,300 ms of lag
//      after `goto` — which is roughly what `macos-latest` costs it — and checks 4, 5 AND 6
//      went red together:
//
//          FAIL  4  expected "dark" / actual "light"    (the clamp, dropped by the ceiling)
//          FAIL  5  expected 0 / actual 3               (the app's theme switch, uncovered)
//          FAIL  6  opening the menu did not lift the curtain
//
//      Run 34010691469 on `macos-latest` reported only the first of those, which is what a
//      270 ms window looks like from outside. With `HOLD_CURTAIN` the same three pass at
//      3,300 ms and at 12,000 ms of lag, and 4b is what states the reason in the log.
//
// THE RUST HALF — `Theme::default()` being Dark, an absent key reading as dark rather than
// as a choice, the font ladder snapping instead of resetting, and `initials_from` returning
// `None` rather than a guess — is in `crates/richos-core/src/config.rs`, with its own eight
// mutations recorded in this branch's commit messages. The one worth repeating here is that
// a single test which set BOTH the theme and the scale passed even with `set_theme`'s
// `persist()` removed, because `persist()` rewrites the whole file and the scale's write
// carried the unpersisted theme to disk on its behalf. It is now two tests with one setter
// each.
