// GETTING THE SPEECH MODEL — the renderer's half, under the engine Tauri actually ships.
//
// `.github/README.md` said: "Voice does not work yet. Typing does. Speech needs a model this
// build does not download for you." The backend downloads it now
// (`crates/richos-voice/src/provision.rs` + `src-tauri/src/voice_provision.rs`, both covered by
// their own Rust tests). This suite is about the only part those cannot see: what a person is
// shown, what he can press, and the one thing that must NOT happen.
//
// THE INVARIANT THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR, above every control it checks: **the offer path opens no
// microphone.** On published v1.0.0 the talk button asked for the microphone, said "listening…",
// lit macOS's orange recording indicator and never transcribed — for 25+ seconds (ray-opus-a1,
// 2026-09-04). The fix was to stop offering the button. This work puts the button back on a
// machine where it now leads somewhere, which reopens exactly that hole, so check 2 asserts that
// `start_voice_capture` is never invoked on the way to the offer. A feature that made the app able
// to hear by re-shipping a hot mic would be a bad trade.
//
// Every refusal check below carries a positive control, for the reason the Rust suite states: a
// "nothing happened" assertion passes identically when the refusal worked and when the whole
// surface stopped responding.
