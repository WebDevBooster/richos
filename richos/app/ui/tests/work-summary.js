  //
  // The check above has guarded `savedWork` across a conversation change since it was
  // written — `"old-company receipt leaked"` — and `drillItems` was cleared beside it. But
  // `renderDrillChip` reads FOUR pieces of state, and the other two, `workerCounts` and
  // `assignments.rows`, were not touched by `openThread`. So the chip went on printing the
  // conversation he had just LEFT — "1 working", "1 waiting for you", "2 assignments
  // running" — over the conversation he had just arrived at, until the three-second poll
  // came back with this thread's answer. That is one entity's work beside another entity's
  // conversation, which is the leak `openThread`'s own `closeWorkerInspector()` comment
  // calls "the exact shape of leak every guard in this build exists to stop", arriving
  // through a door nothing was watching.
  //
  // **HELD STILL RATHER THAN RACED.** The refill is on a free-running 3,000 ms interval
  // whose next tick can land ten milliseconds after the switch, so asserting "the chip is
  // clean for a moment" would be a coin toss. Instead `get_assignments` is made to HANG
  // before the switch: `pollWorkerStatus` awaits it and never returns, `workStatusBusy`
  // stays raised, and nothing can refill the chip from anything. What is on screen after
  // that is therefore exactly what `openThread` left there synchronously — which is the
  // thing under test, with the clock taken out of it.

  // **THE CHIP IS RIGHT IN THE FIRST RENDERED STATE — at launch and after a switch.**
  //
  // The two checks above prove the chip is never the PREVIOUS conversation's. This one proves
  // it is THIS conversation's straight away, which is the other half of the same defect: the
  // refill used to be a free-running 3,000 ms interval with no leading call, so after every
  // launch and every switch the status line he reads most often was empty for up to three
  // seconds while work was already running. `techy.js`'s own shutter note measured it — the
  // line absent at the shutter and present 1.6 s later.
  //
  // **THE CONTROL IS THE INIT SCRIPT, NOT THE WAIT.** A `waitForFunction` on a chip that a
  // 3,000 ms interval is about to fill would go green with or without the fix; it would time
  // nothing and prove nothing. So the interval is TAKEN AWAY before a line of the app runs,
  // and what remains is the leading `pollWorkerStatus()` in `openThread` and nothing else. If
  // that call is removed, every assertion below times out with an empty chip.
  //
  // 3,000 ms IS UNIQUE TO THE WORKER POLL in the shipping UI — `main.js` also creates a
  // 1,000 ms timer tick and a 1,000 ms wait band, `phone.js` a 2,000 ms poller and
  // `permissions.js` a 500 ms one — so the filter hits exactly one interval, and the run
  // ASSERTS that rather than assuming it. A future `WORKER_POLL_MS` that stops being 3,000
  // fails here loudly instead of quietly disarming the control.
