// A BACKGROUND JOB'S QUESTION IS NOT A TURN THAT A QUIT CUT OFF.
//
// Ray's walk of nightly candidate 38, D8 (`docs/verification/2026-10-05-nightly-38-candidate-walk.md`,
// frame `e-overlap-light`): a background job stopped to ask him a question, and under that
// question card the conversation said
//
//     This turn was still running the last time RichOS was open, and I can't tell you how
//     it ended.
//
// while RichOS had never closed.
//
// THE CAUSE. A job's question is scoped to its OBLIGATION, not to a conversation turn
// (`native.rs`, `prepare_question_scope(&work.entity_id, &work.thread_id, &work.obligation_id, ...)`),
// and `question_host.rs` appends it to the timeline snapshot with that id as its `turnId`.
// No ledger turn has that id, so the snapshot carries no `work_duration` row for it. The
// renderer nonetheless made a turn RECORD for it out of the question item alone, with the
// record's created defaults (`queued`, not live) — exactly what a turn left running by a quit
// looks like — and drew "Status unavailable" and the quit card under the question.
//
// WHAT THIS SUITE PINS, each absence beside a positive control in the same page:
//   1. A job's question renders, with no duration row and no quit card.
//   2. A ledger turn that really was left running still gets the quit card (the §14 case
//      the card exists for), so check 1's absence is a fact about the question.
//   3. The question keeps its place in the conversation, between the turns around it.
//
// Run: node job-question.js   (or `npm test` for every suite in this directory)
