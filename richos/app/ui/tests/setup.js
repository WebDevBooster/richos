// FIRST-RUN SETUP, AT THE SURFACE — the one consent step, and everything it must and must
// not do.
//
// WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS. `ceo-decisions.md` §19: "today RichOS runs on his Mac and would not
// run on anyone else's". A customer needs Claude Code AND the engine directory, and the engine
// "ships in no payload and has no route onto another machine at all". The Rust half of the fix
// is proved by 33 tests in `crates/richos-core/tests/setup.rs` and by a fresh-install run on a
// clean HOME. This file is the other half: what he is asked, what he is told, and what happens
// when it goes wrong.
//
// WHAT IT HOLDS, and each is a clause of the contract rather than a nicety:
//
//   1. A CUSTOMER'S MAC ASKS, and asks THIS first — before the memory question and before the
//      company question, because without a binary and an engine there is nothing for a corpus
//      to be read by. One dialog at a time, and held back is not dropped.
//   2. NO TERMINAL, NO PATH, NO VERSION NUMBER anywhere on the sheet. Computed from the
//      rendered text, not from intent.
//   3. THE BYO-ANTHROPIC SENTENCE IS ON THE SHEET, ABOVE THE BUTTON. Row 3.14's second
//      condition: D removes one setup step of two and must not be sold as zero-touch.
//   4. A BUILD THAT CANNOT INSTALL EXPLAINS INSTEAD OF OFFERING A BUTTON THAT WILL FAIL.
//   5. A FAILURE REACHES THE SCREEN, verbatim, and the sheet stays usable — every SetupError's
//      sentence is written for him and names what to do.
//   6. PROGRESS IS LIVE. The events the backend emits are what moves the line; a sheet that
//      only rendered the return value would look hung for the minutes Anthropic's installer
//      takes.
//   7. A MACHINE THAT HAS EVERYTHING IS NEVER ASKED.
//   8. THE BUTTON CANNOT BE PRESSED TWICE. A second press mid-run would start a second
//      installer.
//   9. A QUESTION OWNS THE WINDOW UNTIL IT IS ANSWERED. `aria-modal="true"` is a promise that
//      everything outside the sheet is unavailable; case 20 measures that the window keeps it,
//      including for the one control that floats above every screen.
//
// Run: node setup.js   (or `npm test` for every suite in this directory)

  // MEASURED ON PUBLISHED v1.0.1 (ray-opus-a2, 2026-09-04). A walk from a fresh state ended
  // with `~/Library/Application Support/RichOS/engine` holding zero files, the first-run
  // sheet ADVANCED to the corpus question, and four sends in a row refused with
  // LEASE_UNAVAILABLE_MESSAGE. The click that started it was aimed at "Set it up" and landed
  // in empty space below the panel.
  //
  // It landed on the backdrop. `#setup-sheet` is the full-screen overlay and the sheet the
  // customer sees is `.overlay-panel` inside it, and main.js closed the whole thing on
  // `e.target === setupSheetEl`. Re-measured here before the fix, on both presets: sheet
  // hidden=true, run_setup called=false, memory question showing=true.
  //
  // The bar is not "warn him". It is that a mis-aimed click, and a stranger's habit of
  // clicking beside a dialog to be rid of it, cannot produce an app that looks set up and is
  // not. So: the backdrop does nothing, the panel body does nothing, and the only ways out are
  // the two buttons that say what they do.
  //
  // ESCAPE CHANGED SIDES ON 2026-09-17, BY THE CEO'S OWN RULING, and this paragraph is where
  // the change is recorded rather than quietly made. Until that day this case asserted that
  // Escape was INERT here, on the reasoning that "nobody added it to the list" is not a
  // guarantee. His item 1 that morning: *"The user must always be able to close any popup of
  // any kind by simply tapping the escape key on the keyboard i.e. without having to click
  // anything"*. A sheet is a popup, so Escape closes this one too.
  //
  // WHAT THAT DOES NOT COST, and it is the reason the change is safe rather than a reversal of
  // 704b4596. This case was never about Escape; it is about an ACCIDENT — a click aimed at a
  // button that lands sixty pixels low. Escape is not a mis-aim, and it now does EXACTLY what
  // the named way out does, because `data-dismiss="control:#setup-later,#setup-close"` on the
  // element makes it press that button rather than hide the sheet behind its back. So:
  //
  //   * with "Not now" or "Close" on screen, Escape is that button — the same close, the same
  //     handoff to the corpus question, and `run_setup` still never called;
  //   * DURING THE INSTALL, when both buttons are hidden because dismissing mid-download is

  // 18 — THE OFFER HAS TO REACH THE SCREEN, AND EVERY OTHER CHECK IN THIS FILE STEPPED PAST
  //      THE ONE SURFACE THAT WAS HIDING IT
  //
  // MEASURED ON THE REAL WINDOW, candidate .15 (v1.2.0-nightly.20260919.4, source dcebed09,
  // build 9375f30d), escalation `esc-20260919T152225Z-2e44d112`. Ray's scratch HOME carried an
  // engine installed from `3313945b26b7` against a build pinning `adece4c069e4`. The BACK END
  // was right about all of it — `app.log`, verbatim: *"first-run setup: the RichOS engine is
  // NOT installed — 3 place(s) looked"* and *"first-run setup: this build installs engine
  // 1.2.0."* — and across four live captures between 16:08 and 16:4x **no setup sheet ever
  // appeared**, at entry or afterwards. He typed a job into a Mac that could not answer it and
  // got "I lost my connection to the part of me that thinks" instead of the offer.
  //
  // `openApp` above — and `first-run-sheet.js`, and every other suite here — calls
  // `leaveHome()`, which is `RichHome.hide()` through the API. A person does not have that
  // function. He arrives on the HOME SCREEN, and measured under WebKit that screen is
  // `z-index: 150` over `.overlay`'s `60`, sets `inert` on `#app` (which is where
  // `#setup-sheet` lives), and pulls focus back to its own door. So the sheet `init()` opened
  // was in the DOM, `hidden === false`, un-clickable, un-focusable and behind the picture —
  // and `main.js`'s Escape machinery counted it as on screen and pressed its "Not now" for
  // him. `RichDismiss.open()` returned `["setup-sheet"]` with the home screen on top of it.
  //
  // So this check does what he does: it opens the app and presses the door. Nothing else in
  // this file would have caught it, because nothing else in this file ever saw the home screen.
  //
  // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  // AND THEN IT WENT GREEN OVER A DEFECT THAT WAS STILL THERE — candidate .16, Ray again
  // (`esc-20260919T171553Z-e42d1166`): the offer on screen and `AXFocusedUIElement` reading
  // `text area Message to Rich`. This check asserted focus and passed. TWO REASONS, and in
  // both of them the harness boots in an order the app never boots in:
  //
  //  1. THE MOCK BRIDGE COSTS NOTHING. `mock.js`'s `invoke` is an `async` function over data
  //     already in memory, so `init()`'s whole await chain drains on already-resolved promises
  //     and FINISHES BEFORE THE PARSER DOES. `home.js` installs its give-way in `afterShell`,
  //     at `DOMContentLoaded`. Measured under WebKit with a focus-tracing shim, mock timings:
  //
  //       t=151ms  main.js:7655  openSetupSheet -> focus #setup-go   (swallowed)
  //       t=168ms  main.js:7721  init tail      -> focus #input      (swallowed)
  //       t=177ms  home.js:1727  afterShell     -> DOMContentLoaded
  //       t=179ms  home.js:915   give-way       -> focus #setup-go   LANDED, and LAST
  //
  //     With the bridge costing one task per command — which is what a Tauri IPC round trip
  //     is, and the floor under every real one — the same four lines arrive in the opposite
  //     order and the last one is the one that wins:
  //
  //       t=145ms  DOMContentLoaded
  //       t=244ms  main.js:7655  openSetupSheet -> focus #setup-go   (swallowed, #app inert)
  //       t=252ms  home.js:915   give-way       -> focus #setup-go   LANDED
  //       t=304ms  main.js:7721  init tail      -> focus #input      LANDED, and LAST
  //
  //     So the shim below is not a slower harness; it is the ONLY one of the two orders the
  //     product can actually boot in. A suite that boots in the other one measures a build
  //     nobody runs.
  //
  //  2. IT MEASURED BEFORE THE BOOT HAD FINISHED. Waiting for `#home` to go hidden is waiting
  //     for the give-way, which happens 52 ms BEFORE `init()`'s last focus call. The wait is
  //     now `RichSplash.state.reason === "app-ready"` — `main.js` yields the curtain two lines
  //     below that focus call, so the marker is the product's own word that `init()` is past
  //     it. The curtain is left to the app for the same reason: a person does not call
  //     `yieldNow`, and hand-yielding it threw away the app's own end-of-boot signal.
  //
  // AND THE ESCAPE HALF OF THIS CHECK COULD NOT FAIL AT ALL. It asserted
  // `!homeOpen || !sheetHidden` three lines after waiting for `#home` to be hidden, so
  // `homeOpen` was false by construction and the disjunction was true whatever Escape did —
  // a check shaped like a check. What it should have held is below.

  //
  // Ray, candidate .16 audit, row B1b: *"With the sheet up, the whole app subtree is still in
  // the AX tree, the composer holds focus and accepts typed characters, and the top-right
  // Settings control is still clickable and takes focus away from the sheet."*
  //
  // THE SHEET SAYS `aria-modal="true"` AND THE WINDOW DOES NOT MAKE IT TRUE. That attribute is
  // a promise to assistive technology that everything outside this dialog is unavailable;
  // `inert` is the only thing that keeps it. Measured at 5f3a1a1e under WebKit at 1400x950 on
  // `setup: "missing-engine"`, with the offer up and the curtain gone: `#input`, the rail's
  // `#rail-settings` gear and the top-right `#set-btn` each take focus on `.focus()`, and a
  // click on `#set-btn` opens `#set-menu` over the sheet — `hidden=false`, `aria-expanded=true`.
  //
  // WHICH CORRECTS HALF OF RAY'S SENTENCE AND MAKES THE OTHER HALF WORSE. "It takes focus and
  // then does nothing" is not what the window does here: it takes focus AND opens the menu, on
  // top of a question the CEO has not answered.
  //
  // WHY NEITHER OF THE TWO OBVIOUS FIXES IS THE FIX, both measured rather than reasoned about:
  //
  //   * MOVING THE SHEET TO BODY LEVEL closes nothing. `.settings` is mounted against
  //     `document.body` by `settings-button.js:748` and painted at z-index 300 by §15's "on
  //     every screen" rule; the sheet is an `.overlay` at 60 wherever it lives. Measured stack
  //     at the button's own center, offer up: `set-btn@auto < settings@300 < setup-sheet@60`
  //     — the control is above the sheet, and a body-level sheet is still at 60.
  //   * MARKING `#app` INERT cannot be done from inside `#app`: `#setup-sheet` is a child of it
  //     (`index.html:936` against `:100`), so that one attribute would inert the question too.
  //
  // So what is marked is the COMPLEMENT OF THE SHEET'S OWN ANCESTOR CHAIN, which needs no
  // opinion about where a sheet lives and reaches `.settings` because `<body>` is on that

  // dead conjunction in `src-tauri/src/main.rs` — `!spine.has_lease() && !spine.has_lease_
  // factory()`, with a factory that is configured unconditionally at boot — so a spoken turn
  // on a Mac whose engine is stale started a turn that could not finish and came back as

  // asking again is worth a try."* Asking again cannot work.

  // THE BACKEND HALF IS ASSERTED IN RUST (`cargo test --bin richos-tauri`,
  // `the_first_run_arm_is_asked_before_a_turn_starts_and_not_behind_the_factory`, which now
  // requires the arm at BOTH sites and refuses one). THIS IS THE WINDOW HALF, and without it

  // back on your screen: press Set it up", and nothing in the window was reopening it on
  // `rich://voice-error`.

// 14   main.js: restore setupSheetEl.addEventListener("click", e => { if (e.target ===

//        -> the first sentence a customer reads names a control that cannot work
// 13   main.js `refreshVoiceReadiness`: hide ◉ unconditionally
//        -> voice is deleted rather than withheld, on every machine
// 20   main.js: delete the `syncQuestionInert` observer
//        -> the composer, the rail gear and the top-right Settings control all take focus
//           behind an unanswered engine offer, and the settings menu opens over it — which is
//           the shipped behavior at 5f3a1a1e and Ray's candidate .16 row B1b
// 20b  main.js `syncQuestionInert`: drop the `isPainted(question)` line
//        -> a full-screen surface mounted over the question is marked inert, which removes it
//           from hit testing, which blinds `isPainted()` — and `escape.js` B8 goes red
// 20c  main.js `syncQuestionInert`: mark the ancestors instead of their other children
//        -> the question inerts itself and the app has no way out at all
// 21   main.js: restore `Bridge.listen("rich://voice-error", ({payload}) => { if (!voiceMode)
//        return; richVoiceSays(payload.message); })`
//        -> RUN, not reasoned about: the old handler was put back, `node setup.js` reported
//           "a spoken turn was refused for the setting up and the offer did not come back",
//           and it was taken out again. The backend's own sentence promises the sheet is on
//           screen, and nothing was putting it there.
// 21b  main.js: drop the `items.length` condition and call `maybeAskAboutSetup()` on every
//        voice error
//        -> the negative control goes red: a lost microphone opens the first-run offer on a
//           machine that has everything
