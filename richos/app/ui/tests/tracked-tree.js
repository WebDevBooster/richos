// NO TEST WRITES INTO THE TRACKED TREE IT IS VERIFYING.
//
// 2026-09-29: the merge gate verifying `cc/echo-opus-speckle1` in the main checkout was
// refused by its own tests. `splash.js` photographed two app screens the branch had
// legitimately changed and `publishShot` wrote the new pictures over the committed references;
// the gate saw its source change during verification and canceled every check. The nightly
// had been doing the same with `home.js` and restoring it afterwards. Evidence: proof run
// `/Volumes/E1TB/state/richos/proof-runs/60e53bf487d5/20260929T104103Z-6uv1121i/`
// (`03-splash.js.log` lines 2-3, `contamination/source.json`).
//
// WHAT THIS SUITE PROVES, each check a way the fix could be wrong:
//
//   1. A picture that differs from its committed reference is NOT written over it, through the
//      real `publishShot` and a real committed file; the picture this run took is kept in
//      `.shots/changed/` (gitignored) where a person can look at it.
//   2. The harness's end-of-suite guard turns a suite that DOES write a tracked file red, in
//      that suite's own report, naming the file — the layer that catches the next writer that
//      never goes near `publishShot`.
//   3. Negative control: a suite that writes nothing passes the guard.
//   4. A file already modified before the suite started is not blamed for the person's edit;
//      the same file changed again during the suite is.
//   5. A new untracked file is blamed; a gitignored one is not.
//   6. A tracked file saved OUTSIDE the UI tree during the suite (an unrelated editor save) is
//      not blamed on it; one inside the UI tree still is. In a real checkout the watched scope
//      is `richos/app/ui`, not the repository (part-2 hunt section 07, 2026-09-29).
//
// Checks 2-6 run a child suite (`fixtures/tracked-tree-suite.js`) against a throwaway git
// repository, so the guard is proven red without ever touching a real tracked file — a test
// of this rule that wrote into this checkout would be the defect it tests for.
