// AMERICAN ENGLISH ON THE SIGN-IN PATH — a scanner over the two files that shipped a British
// spelling on text a person reads: `provider_auth.rs`'s `AuthState::Cancelled` message and
// `main.js`'s cancel-failure catch clause (nightly QA audit
// `docs/verification/2026-09-17-nightly-1.2.0-20260917.1-silent-audit.md` §D1, richos
// `5f448983`). CEO ruling, 2026-08-29: American English is the language of every string a
// person reads.
//
// SCOPE IS DELIBERATELY NARROW, not a blanket grep for the British spelling over either whole
// file. `AuthState::Cancelled` is a Rust enum variant identifier, and its
// `#[serde(rename_all = "kebab-case")]` wire value is the ACP-style protocol value `mock.js`
// matches against (`providerState = "cancelled"`) — neither is prose a person reads, and the
// dialect rule never binds an identifier or a wire value. So this scan reads ONLY the two
// literals that hold what the human sees, each pulled out by the shape of the call that
// carries it rather than by the word itself, and checks that literal alone.
//
// EVERY CHECK CARRIES A POSITIVE CONTROL, for the reason `voice-model.js` states: a "nothing
// found" assertion passes identically when the scanner works and when it is not looking at
// anything at all. Each check re-runs its own extractor against a string that plants the
// forbidden British spelling in the exact shape it targets, and requires the extractor to
// both find the literal and see the forbidden word in it — proving the clean result above it
// is not vacuous. Those fixtures are never written to disk, and each carries its own
// `dialect-exempt:` marker: the word inside them is the thing under test, not a claim about
// what this file itself says.
//
// No browser: this is a plain node script, in the shape `docs-claims.js` already uses. `run.js`
// runs every .js file in this directory, so it is registered by existing, and its row in this
// README keeps `docs-claims.js`'s own table check green.

// NO M-DASH OR N-DASH IN ANY UI TEXT (CEO feedback 2026-10-06, item 3: "No UI text should
// contain any m-dashes or n-dashes"). The last check below reads, every run:
//
//   1. every string literal, text node and readable attribute (placeholder, title,
//      aria-label) in every shipped UI file, derived by `lib/ui-sources.js` from the tree.
//      Not only the prose `state-strings.js` inventories: a lone dash used as a label is UI
//      text too. HTML comments inside a template literal are dropped, because code comments
//      are not UI text; so are `${...}` holes, which are code.
//   2. the Rust sentences the UI relays: the CEO-facing scrape (`rustStrings()`, the same set
//      the affordance rule classifies) plus every sentence-shaped literal (a capital first
//      letter, sentence punctuation last, four words or more) outside tests and examples.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT READ, NAMED: `mock.js` and `home/field-data.js` (browser-preview sample
// data, blind spot B4); a Rust literal on a log, print, assert or panic line (a terminal, not
// the screen); a model prompt whose text opens with an all-caps header word or carries an
// all-caps run of two words ("ONBOARDING", "COMPANY MEMORY"), which Rich reads and the CEO
// does not; lowercase Rust error text relayed through `String(e)` (blind spot B5, an
// unbounded set). And it cannot see what Rich himself writes in a reply: that is generated at
// run time, not shipped text.
