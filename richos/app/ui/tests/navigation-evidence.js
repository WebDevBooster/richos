// NAVIGATION EVIDENCE — the harness writes down what a page was doing when a navigation
// failed, and changes nothing else about the failure.
//
// THE FAILURE THIS IS FOR. 2026-09-21, release run `20260921T114115Z-c0fd6ac5`: one
// `page.goto: Timeout 30000ms exceeded.` in `contrast.js` at `entity-view/dark`, a `file://`
// load that normally takes under a tenth of a second. The isolated rerun passed, the cause is
// unknown, and the record's instruction is to capture the failing navigation state if it
// recurs — never to quarantine the suite, retry it or widen its deadline. The capture lives in
// `lib/navigation-evidence.js` and is installed for every suite by `loadPlaywright()`.
//
// WHAT THIS SUITE PROVES, and each check is a way the capture could be wrong:
//
//   1. It is really installed, and a navigation that succeeds returns Playwright's own
//      response and writes nothing — a capture proven only on failures could be absent.
//   2. NEGATIVE CONTROL. A load that never completes still turns its suite RED, with
//      Playwright's message byte-for-byte, and leaves a bundle holding the real lifecycle:
//      the document arrived and parsed, `load` never came, and the image holding it up is
//      named as in flight. The navigation failed at the deadline it was given, not later.
//   3. The deadline is the PAGE'S. With no timeout passed, the page's own default decides,
//      and a document that never answers is recorded as exactly that.
//   4. A page whose own script never yields cannot hang the collection: the bundle is still
//      written, says which parts of the page would not answer, and the suite is still red.
//   5. The off switch removes the capture and changes nothing else about the failure.
//   6. What it costs a passing load, measured against the same page without it, and printed.
//   7. A host too loaded to start a helper process in time still gets its CPU sample, and the
//      failure stays red exactly as in 2. On 2026-09-29 (nightly `20260929T044015Z-588457c3`)
//      the sample was `spawnSync /usr/bin/top`, it timed out with three gates side by side,
//      and check 2 went red for the host's reason instead of the product's.
//
// The failing navigations run in a child process (`fixtures/navigation-hang-suite.js`) so
// their evidence lines and bundles never appear in THIS suite's output or in the run's real
// evidence directory, where they would read as a real failure.
