// USE RICH FROM YOUR PHONE — the Mac's half of pairing (plan §4.1), and it has ONE path.
//
// **CEO §61, 2026-09-18, and it is the definition the whole of this file is built to:** *"the new
// working definition for a mobile app or PWA is this: it's an app that lets the user use RichOS
// (in some way) while being on the go and away from office i.e. outside the home network. Because
// any mobile app or PWA is utterly useless within the home network. The desktop app is a much
// better tool in that case. … The RichOS desktop app will guide technical users (with the help of
// crystal-clear and ultra-simple how-to screens in the app) to their Tailscale setup. That's it.
// The Tailscale setup is where we start now."*
//
// **SO THERE IS NO QUESTION TO ASK AND NO SECOND DOOR.** Until 2026-09-19 this screen opened on
// *"Where do you want to use it?"* with `Anywhere, including away from home` and `At home only`,
// and the second option led to a self-signed certificate, a trust code at
// `http://<name>.local:8444/ca` and sixteen taps through Apple's own settings. §61 does not keep
// that as a lesser path; it calls the thing it does *useless*. What replaces the chooser is the
// flow that was already behind the first option: the identity warning (§61.1), the Tailscale
// how-to screens, `This Mac is ready`, the code, the paired card. A reader who wants to use Rich
// on the sofa has a much better tool for it already open in front of him.
//
// **WHAT IS NOT REMOVED, because it was never about the home path:** the six words, the five-minute
// window and its announced expiry, the code sitting above the steps (Urban's G3), the paired
// card's heading and push line (G8), the account named in bold (G14), `floor` on the countdown
// (G13), the scroll that lands on the code (N2, G4), and the one control on the pairing screen
// that actually puts something down (G2). Each of those is a fix to a screen that still exists.
//
// **THE SECOND HALF OF §61 — the paid relay for non-technical users — is not built here and is
// not stubbed here.** It is a path this product does not have yet, and a screen offering it would
// be a screen promising one.
//
// NO NEW COLORS. Every piece of text here uses a class the shipped shell already paints and the
// contrast suite already walks. The only new visual is the QR canvas, which paints its own white
// quiet zone and black modules — 21:1, and the quiet zone is part of the code rather than
// decoration: a code drawn flush to a dark page background does not scan.

         screenshots 13, 14, 15 and 17). The fix then was to key it off the route; CEO 61

         5.78:1, identical to the four paragraphs above them (Ray's frames 21 and 22). A card
         where nothing is the top and nothing is the point.

         So the phone's own name is the heading — it is what the card is ABOUT, and it is the one
         string on it that changes — and the push line, which is the only line that asks the

    <!-- SCREEN 5 — THE CODE, AND THEN THE FOUR THINGS TO DO ON THE PHONE.
         There is no second version of this screen any more. It used to carry, below the code, two
         unverified-certificate warnings, a trust QR and sixteen numbered taps through Apple's
         settings — the home path's half — hidden on the Tailscale route and shown on the other
         one. CEO §61 leaves one route, so those are gone from the product rather than hidden
         behind a condition, and with them the whole class of defect where the wrong half was
         drawn (Urban's blocker "esc-20260919T041857Z-640acd39", Ray's candidate .11 defect 3.1).

         THE CODE IS FIRST — Urban's G3 and G4. At 1024x700, the app's own minimum and the size it
         restores itself to, this screen is about three viewport heights tall, and pressing "Set my
         phone up" used to land on a wall of instruction with the QR, the six words, the countdown
         and the only Close all out of sight (his frames 04 and 05). *"The four phone steps are
         preparation for a person who has not started; the code is what a person who is standing
         there with their phone needs. Order the screen for the second person."*

         IT IS THE MARKUP'S OWN ORDER NOW, not a node moved at render time. The mover existed
         because the other path numbered its headings 1, 2, 3 and the numbers were load-bearing —
         the certificate at step 1 was what made the address at step 2 open at all — so the code
         could not go above it there. With one path there is no sequence to contradict, and a
         subtree that is re-inserted on every two-second poll is a subtree that can take the focus
         out of itself. -->

           Cancel button anywhere in the sheet (frame 19). Two things a person is asked to do

           with the code; this one was missed, so it is now hidden by the same live test they
           are — and the control it names is Close, which is the button this sheet actually has

      <!-- THESE FOUR STEPS ARE THE CEO'S OWN, AND THEY OVERRIDE URBAN'S THREE.
           He installed and uninstalled Tailscale on Android THREE TIMES looking for a "connect to
           Mac" step that does not exist. Urban's Screen 5 had three steps and stopped at "sign in",
           which is where that hunt begins: the app is signed in, nothing says it is finished, and
           the user goes looking for the pairing screen Tailscale does not have. So the two missing
           steps — the VPN permission prompt, and the switch reading Connected — are what end the
           hunt, and the sentence below says outright that the thing he was hunting for is not
           there. Recorded in docs/verification/tailscale-path-2026-09-18.md.

             result is two networks that never see each other with nothing on either screen saying

           *"Once Set my phone up is pressed, the route chooser is unreachable for the life of the
           app process"* — the expired state sets "pairing" as well, so waiting did not give it
           back either, and he could not re-reach "This Mac is ready" in dark at all after his
           walk.

           **THE CONTROL SURVIVES ITS OWN NAME.** It used to read "Pick a different way", which
           named the chooser it returned to; with one path there is no different way to pick, and
           the half of this button that was never about the chooser is the half that matters — it
           STOPS SERVING. It undoes a socket and a live code, which is why it calls
           phone_stop_pairing rather than only redrawing, and the screen it returns to is
           "This Mac is ready". See PhoneRuntime::stop_pairing for why that is not phone_forget.

           The four plain copies of this control — on the identity screen, on the two waiting
           screens and on "This Mac is ready" — are gone with the chooser they led to. Nothing was
           behind them to put down, and a button that returns to the screen you are already on is
           a button that does nothing. Close is on every screen and always was.

           defect. Measured in this harness at 1024x700, dark, with a code live: the panel is
           592px tall in a 700px window and its content is 1196px, so on a REOPENED sheet the
           three controls sat at window y 1040..1116 — "Show me another code", "Stop and go back"
           and "Close", none of them on screen, under sixteen steps of how-to. Ray read the same
           thing off AX on the real app: y=1175..1364 against a window bottom of y=792.

    <!-- SCREEN 0 — THE IDENTITY TRAP, AND IT COMES BEFORE THE DOWNLOAD.
         CEO §61.1, his ruling in his own words: *"this barrier or I would call it stupidity would
         need to be made ABSOLUTELY UBER MEGA SUPER CRYSTAL-CLEAR to ever user of RichOS"*. What he
         hit: Tailscale has no email-and-password sign-in, only "Sign in with Apple / Google /
         Microsoft / GitHub"; the account IS the network; he signed in with Apple on the Mac and
         Google on the Android, got two networks that cannot see each other, and REINSTALLED
         Tailscale on the Android three times looking for a "connect to Mac" step that does not
         exist. Nothing on Tailscale's screens says any of this.

         **WHY IT IS ITS OWN SCREEN AND NOT A LINE ON THE DOWNLOAD SCREEN.** By the time somebody
         is on the download screen the next thing they do is create the account, and the choice of
         identity is made inside somebody else's sign-in sheet where nothing of ours can reach
         them. A warning that arrives after that choice is a warning that costs a sign-out. His
         own sentence is the reason it cannot be a footnote: *"in hindsight this sounds obvious,
         but it's absolutely NOT obvious at all. Especially given that I would normally absolutely
         NEVER use the same identity on the Mac and on the phone."*

         It is shown while the Mac has no Tailscale account yet — which is exactly the window in
         which the choice can still be made freely — and never again after detection can name one,
         because from then on the screens say WHICH account rather than warning about the choice. -->

      <h3 class="phone-step-title">First: Tailscale has no password</h3>
      <p class="overlay-note">Tailscale has no username and password. It only offers

        private network.</p>
      <p class="overlay-note">So this Mac and your phone have to sign in with the
        <strong>same</strong> one. Two different identities make two separate networks that cannot

           **FIRST, AND IN BOLD** — Urban's G14. It was the third paragraph, under the machine
           name, set in --ink-soft with the account given no weight at all, and visually identical
           to the paragraphs either side of it (his frame 02). Two screens later the same account
           IS set in <strong> (his frame 04). *"That asymmetry is backwards: the screen that names
           the account first is the one that whispers it ... it is the thing that decides whether
           this works, and the machine name is not."*

           AND THE PARAGRAPH BELOW STILL READS RIGHT, which is why the account went ABOVE the
           name rather than the name below it: "That is this Mac's name on your own Tailscale
           network" points at the line before it, so the name has to stay immediately in front

    <!-- WHAT THE MAC IS DOING, OR WHY IT COULD NOT — OUTSIDE EVERY STATE BLOCK, WHICH IS A
         MOVE THIS CHANGE FORCED.

         It lived inside "#phone-pairing", which is hidden on five of the six screens. That was
         survivable while "Set my phone up" was pressed on a screen whose own failure mode was
         a certificate this Mac makes for itself and can hardly fail to make. It is not
         survivable now: with one path, "phone_begin_pairing" fails whenever Tailscale will not
         issue a certificate for this Mac, and that failure is read on "This Mac is ready" — a
         screen that would have shown the sentence to nobody. "Making a certificate for your
         phone…" had the same problem pointing the other way, and so did the sentence
         "Get Tailscale" shows when the Mac cannot open a link.

         The SOCKET DUMP that used to sit beside it is still gone — Urban's G5, *"the one thing
         on this flow that looks like a debug log that shipped ... deletion is the change I want
         most on this screen"*. The addresses are still printed to the log at every start, which
         is where a diagnosis is read from. -->

    <!-- ONE CLOSE, OUTSIDE THE THREE STATES AND ALWAYS VISIBLE.
         The first version of this sheet had three, one inside each state block, and
         ui/tests/escape.js refused it on the spot: data-dismiss names ONE control, the
         document-level Escape handler clicks it, and a button hidden with its block does
         nothing at all. Two of the three states could not be dismissed from the keyboard. One
         button that is always on screen is both the simpler markup and the only shape that can
         satisfy the contract.

         **"ALWAYS VISIBLE" WAS A CLAIM ABOUT THE MARKUP AND NOT ABOUT THE SCREEN, AND A PERSON
         FOUND THE DIFFERENCE.** One Close outside the three states is what makes it always
         RENDERED; it is .phone-actions below that makes it always SEEN. With a code live at
         1024x700 the panel's content is 1196px in a 590px scrollport, and this row sat 445px
         below the window's bottom edge while the six-words note three screens above it read
         *"press Close and tell me"*. The row is now pinned to the bottom of the scrollport
         with position:sticky, so the how-to scrolls under it and the way out does not leave.

         AND THE PAIRING SCREEN'S TWO CONTROLS JOIN IT, for the same reason and in one row: two
         separately-pinned rows would overlap. They are hidden with the screen they belong to —
         by their own hidden attribute, set in render() from the same condition that shows the
         pairing block, because a display:none button contributes no flex gap and the row
         collapses to Close alone. Close stays LAST, which is where the copy points. -->

  /// **WHAT THE SETTINGS ROW SAYS WHEN THE SHEET IS SHUT** — Ray's candidate-.16 defect D2.
  ///
  /// *"With port 8443 open and code 56WS37AH live, the Settings panel reads `Use Rich from your
  /// phone >`. Nothing else. Byte-for-byte the same row as with no code at all, and the same
  /// again while a phone is paired."*
  ///
  /// Three states, two of which have something to say:
  ///
  ///   * paired    -> the phone's own name, which is the one fact that identifies it
  ///   * code live -> that it is live AND how long is left, in `remaining()`'s units — the same
  ///                  sentence the countdown on the sheet is built from, so the row and the sheet
  ///                  cannot state different amounts of time
  ///   * anything else -> nothing, and the row reads exactly as it always did. "Not pairing" is
  ///                  not a state worth a line; a live code and a paired phone are.
  ///
  /// SPEAKABLE, because this app is read out loud (CEO, 2026-09-04): "Paired with Pixel 8" and
  /// "A code is live for 4 more minutes" mean the same thing spoken as written, with no glyph,
  /// no abbreviation and no number whose unit has to be inferred.
  ///
  /// **The expired state deliberately says nothing.** The socket stays up after a window closes
  /// (see `listening` in `render`), so a Mac that is merely still serving is not a Mac with
  /// anything live on it, and a row that said so would be telling him about a code that no
  /// longer works.
