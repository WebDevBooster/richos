// The service worker. It does three jobs and refuses a fourth.
//
//  1. IT KEEPS THE SHELL, so the app OPENS where his Mac does not resolve — on a train, on someone
//     else's Wi-Fi. That is not a trick; it is the ordinary reason a PWA has a service worker, and
//     plan §10.7 depends on it: the origin stays `https://<his-mac>.local:8443` forever and the app
//     must still open there when that name means nothing on the network he is standing in.
//
//  2. IT SHOWS RICH'S REPLY WHEN THE APP IS CLOSED, and writes it into storage on the way past. The
//     push payload is encrypted end to end by RFC 8291 — Apple relays a blob it cannot read — and it
//     carries Rich's actual words rather than "you have a message" (§2.4). Writing the row into
//     IndexedDB as the notification is shown is what makes the reply there when he opens the app
//     away from home, instead of behind a connection that is not available.
//
//  3. IT OPENS THE THREAD WHEN HE TAPS THE NOTIFICATION.
//
// AND THE REFUSAL: IT NEVER CACHES ANYTHING UNDER `/api/`. A cached conversation would make this
// phone a second record of what Rich said, which plan §6 forbids in those words: "A phone that can
// disagree with the Mac about what Rich said is worse than a phone that shows nothing."
//
// One more rule, from WebKit and not from us: EVERY push must display a notification. A handler
// that shows none can have the subscription revoked, so every path below ends in one.
