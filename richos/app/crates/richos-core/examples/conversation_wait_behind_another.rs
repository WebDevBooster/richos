//! **HOW LONG ONE CONVERSATION WAITS BEHIND ANOTHER CONVERSATION'S REPLY.**
//!
//! The CEO's Two Riches page promises two things about parallelism, and only one of them is
//! about the conversation: *"the CEO's conversation with Rich is never blocked by any work
//! that's going on in the background"*, and *"the CEO could open and run multiple things in
//! parallel."* Work in several threads does run in parallel — one back end per thread, since
//! the work host took them. What is still serialized is the front desks' TURNS: the shell
//! holds one `Mutex<Spine>` for the length of a turn (`src-tauri/src/main.rs`), so a message
//! to thread B while thread A is mid-reply is answered at A's turn boundary rather than
//! beside it.
//!
//! **Ruled 2026-09-17 not to be fixed by a refactor unless a measurement forces it**
//! (`esc-20260917T195400Z-3e9b24be`), which makes the measurement the thing that matters.
//! This is it, and it measures the real mechanism rather than a model of it: a real `Spine`,
//! behind the shell's own `Arc<Mutex<…>>`, with the send arriving from another thread
//! exactly as a second Tauri command would.
//!
//! **What this number contains, and what it cannot.**
//!
//! | Component | In this number? |
//! |---|---|
//! | The remainder of thread A's reply, after B's send | **Yes** — it is the whole of the wait |
//! | The lock handoff, the ledger write and the turn boundary | **Yes** |
//! | Thread B's own front desk producing its answer | **Yes** (scripted here as instant) |
//! | The MODEL's latency on either thread | **No.** Scripted. It is the largest real term and it is not this file's to measure |
//!
//! So the number below is the app's own contribution to the wait, and the honest sentence
//! about the real one is: **B waits for whatever is left of A's reply, plus milliseconds.**
//! The run prints both, and the arithmetic between them, rather than asserting either.
//!
//! Run:
//! ```text
//! cargo run -p richos-core --example conversation_wait_behind_another --release
//! ```
//!
//! It touches nothing outside a fresh temp directory, which it removes, and it starts no
//! app, no lease, no provider and no window.
