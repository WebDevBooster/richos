//! **The register is the first tool call, and his first words are a few seconds away — measured
//! on a real provider, one task turn and one question turn.** The CEO's ruling §55, 2026-09-18:
//! *"Rich **immediately** replies with: "On it!" and only after that does all that work."* …
//! *"Yes, a few seconds is fine. But 35 seconds of waiting for the first response is not. Go."*
//!
//! # What this measures and what it refuses
//!
//! **Send → his first words**, taken off `LiveEvent::MessageStarted`/`MessageDelta` — the events
//! the webview renders Rich's text from, so this is when the sentence appears rather than when
//! the turn ends. And the TOOL CALLS on his turn ahead of that first word, which is the term §55
//! exists to remove. The rule the run is scored against is
//! [`richos_core::first_reply::first_reply_faults`], unit-tested against the real defect's own
//! frame sequence so it is proven able to go red.
//!
//! This is the after-measurement for `docs/verification/question-receipt-2026-09-18.md`, which
//! measured the same path at 12.197 s, 19.343 s, 22.956 s and 31.023 s to his first words, with
//! two `ToolSearch` round trips and a continuity checkpoint ahead of the register.
//!
//! # And the other half: no ECS write ahead of his words, and does what was written DISPATCH?
//!
//! Two things were added on 2026-09-18 after the register began opening the obligation itself
//! (`assignment_tools.rs`), and neither is a timing measurement:
//!
//! 1. **The front desk's continuity grant is watched on its own thread for the whole of every
//!    turn** ([`GrantWatch`]) — the `richos_continuity` server's own scope file, shut by
//!    `Cognition::prompt` at the start of a turn and opened by
//!    `ReaderState::he_has_now_been_spoken_to` at his first words. The frame-level rule sees an
//!    ECS write that HAPPENED; this sees whether one was POSSIBLE, which is the half a model
//!    that simply chose not to write would hide. It is watched across the PRIMING turn too,
//!    where it must never open: an internal turn he never saw opening the grant would hand the
//!    next real turn one that was already open.
//! 2. **`richos_work.prepare` is driven for real** ([`does_it_dispatch`]), against the
//!    obligation the register opened (must come back `prepared`, with a workspace and a
//!    payload) and against the old shape — a model-typed obligation nobody ever opened (must
//!    be refused at `app.py:318-321`). The previous record could only state this from source;
//!    this measures it.
//!
//!    **It is driven in the LEASE's OWN ENVIRONMENT, which it was not until 2026-09-18.**
//!    `drive_prepare` builds its own environment and had no `RICHOS_SPAWN_HOOK_SOURCES`, so
//!    `spawn.py` collected all nine of the ENGINE's PreToolUse[Agent] guards instead of the
//!    app's own preflight, and was refused by `guard-owned-state.sh` over the development
//!    session's paused CI — a real, reproducible refusal of a path the shipped app never
//!    takes. And the check scored REACHING the dispatch rather than surviving it, so the run
//!    printed PASS over it. Both are fixed here: the value comes from
//!    `EngineProfile::spawn_hook_sources()`, the same accessor `configure` uses, and only
//!    `status: "prepared"` is a pass.
//!
//! # What it costs and what it touches
//!
//! **`RICHOS_PROBE_DISPATCH_ONLY=1` runs the whole of (2) with NO lease, NO provider and NO
//! model turn**: the register's own code writes the assignment and the engine's own `prepare`
//! judges it, so the join can be re-checked for nothing, forever. That mode is also how the
//! dispatch section was developed and proven red before a single model turn was spent on it.
//!
//! **THREE MODEL TURNS on the CEO's subscription** for the full run — the lease's PRIMING turn,
//! then one task and one question — and it is opt-in for exactly that reason. The priming turn is counted here
//! because it always ran: before 2026-09-18 it ran inside the first `submit_prompt` and the probe
//! measured it as part of turn 1 without naming it, which is how a run of this example came to be
//! described as two model turns when it spent three. Everything it writes goes into a throwaway directory under the system
//! temp directory, which it removes on the way out (CEO §54). `HOME` is left alone, because the
//! provider credentials live there and a synthetic one would make this probe measure a sign-in
//! failure. It opens no audio device, plays nothing, and puts no window on screen — so it says
//! nothing about what the timer beside his reply reads (`ui/tests/question-timer.js` is that).
//!
//! Run:
//! ```text
//! cargo run -p richos-core --example first_reply_timing_e2e -- <engine> <delivered-runtime>
//! RICHOS_PROBE_DISPATCH_ONLY=1 cargo run -p richos-core --example first_reply_timing_e2e -- …

    // attempted. That is the sentence this section replaces with a measurement.

    // Both directions are driven, because a green that cannot go red is not evidence:
    //
    // - **GREEN** — each assignment the register wrote, against the obligation the register
    //   opened for it. The engine must get PAST its obligation gate.
    // - **RED** — the OLD SHAPE, and it is not a synthetic one: the obligation id is
    //   `land-pricing-branch-staging-deploy`, verbatim what run B's model minted for the same
    //   sentence (`first-words-2026-09-18.md`, finding 2), carried by a lease exactly as a real
    //   one would carry it. Nothing ever opened it, so the engine must refuse.
    //
    // **The obligation is also read straight off the store first**, on the work seat, with the
    // same `inspect` `prepare` makes — so a green here is a positive observation of the item's
    // status and not merely `prepare` failing somewhere else.
