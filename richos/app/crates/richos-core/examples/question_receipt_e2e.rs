//! **"I'll check." / "I'll investigate." — one real turn of each kind, against a real
//! provider.** The CEO's ruling §58, 2026-09-18.
//!
//! *"when the user asks Rich a question (in RichOS app) and the front desk Rich doesn't
//! immediately know the answer and therefore has to get it from the back-end Rich, the front
//! desk Rich should reply as follows: If the answer from the back-end Rich is expected to take
//! more than a minute, then the front desk Rich should reply with "I'll investigate." … And if
//! the answer from the back-end Rich is expected to take less than a minute, then the front
//! desk Rich should reply with "I'll check.""*
//!
//! Every other check on this feature drives the app's own code with the model's decision
//! supplied. This one asks a real front-desk lease a real question and reads what it says. It
//! is the only thing that can fail for the one reason the others cannot: the doctrine and the
//! tool description not actually reaching the model.
//!
//! ## What it measures, and what the number does NOT contain
//!
//! **Send → his first words**, taken off `LiveEvent::MessageStarted` / `MessageDelta` — the
//! events the webview renders Rich's text from, so this is the instant the sentence appears
//! rather than the instant the turn ends. §55's acceptance criterion is *"the time from send to
//! "On it!" on screen is the model's first words, a few seconds; 35 s is a defect"*, and §58's
//! two sentences inherit it.
//!
//! | Component | In this number? |
//! |---|---|
//! | The model's own latency before it says anything | **Yes** — and it is the whole of it |
//! | Every tool call it makes before speaking | **Yes.** That is the term §55 exists to remove |
//! | Writing the assignment down, fsynced | **Yes** (measured separately at ~1 ms by `assignment_receipt_timing`) |
//! | Spawning the work lease, preparing a workspace, the answer itself | **No.** All of it is after the turn |
//! | WebKit laying the text out | **No.** This is the event the webview renders from, not a paint |
//!
//! **What this probe does NOT do, said here rather than discovered later: it does not put the
//! app on screen.** There is no window, so it cannot say what the TIMER beside the reply reads
//! — that is `ui/tests/question-timer.js`, under WebKit, against the shipping renderer. Nor
//! does it wait for the answer to come back: the back-end lease that answers a question is the
//! work host's, which this probe does not start. Both are named in the record this writes.
//!
//! ## What it costs and what it touches
//!
//! **TWO MODEL TURNS on the CEO's subscription**, one question of each kind, and it is opt-in
//! for exactly that reason. Everything it writes goes into a throwaway directory under the
//! system temp directory, which it removes; `HOME` is left alone, because the provider
//! credentials live there and a synthetic one would make this probe measure a sign-in failure.
//! No audio device is opened and nothing is played.
//!
//! Run:
//! ```text
//! cargo run -p richos-core --example question_receipt_e2e -- <engine> <delivered-runtime>
//! ```
