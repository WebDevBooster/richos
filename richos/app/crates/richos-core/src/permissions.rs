//! Native provider permission requests surfaced in the desktop. One exact action,
//! one visible turn — and, since the background-work spec's §5.2, one exact action that
//! can WAIT for him when there is no visible turn at all.
//!
//! # What changed, and why it is a change of IDENTITY rather than of a refusal
//!
//! The background-work spec (richos-hq `docs/plans/background-work-spec-2026-09-17.md`
//! revision 5) §5.1 states the position this file used to be in: *"a worker's permission
//! request with no open turn is denied, not queued"*. §5.2 decides the replacement —
//! *"a request raised with no turn open is queued for his next look, and never
//! auto-approved"* — and §5.3 names the part that is easy to miss: the grant is not a flag,
//! it is a whole [`Binding`], and **a request cannot outlive its `turn_id`**. So the work
//! lease's binding carries a stable identity that is not a turn id — the ASSIGNMENT — and
//! this desk compares against that.
//!
//! **The two audiences are therefore held to two different liveness tests, and the
//! difference is the whole of §5.3:**
//!
//! | Audience | Alive while… | Shown on |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | the conversation (`audience != "worker"`) | the grant file still equals the request's binding — a turn | the permission sheet ([`PermissionDesk::current`]) |
//! | background work (`audience == "worker"`) | the ASSIGNMENT is still open, which [`PermissionDesk::forget`] is told | the assignment surface ([`PermissionDesk::background_queue`]) |
//!
//! A background request deliberately survives its own grant file being closed, because the
//! work lease's turn ends while he is away and `revoke_work_assignment` closes the grant on
//! the way out (`native.rs`). Gating his queue on that file would have deleted the request
//! seconds after it was raised — the failure §5.7 is written against, wearing a different
//! hat.
//!
//! # The 300-second deadline stops the CALL, not the REQUEST (§5.7)
//!
//! *"a request raised while he is at lunch is denied long before he looks, and 7.6 fails."*
//! The provider call still ends at its deadline and still ends in **not approved** — nothing
//! holds a provider tool call open for hours. What is new is that the entry stays in the
//! queue with [`Queued::call_returned`] set, so when he answers, the answer applies to the
//! ASSIGNMENT: [`Answered::ToAssignment`] hands it to the work host, which resumes the
//! assignment, and [`Standing`] lets that resumed run take the one exact action he approved.
//!
//! **A standing decision is not an auto-approval and the difference is mechanical.** It
//! matches ONE assignment, ONE tool and ONE exact input, it is consumed on first use, and it
//! dies with the assignment ([`PermissionDesk::forget`]). Nothing here ever decides on his
//! behalf: with no answer from him there is no standing decision, and the refusal is a
//! refusal.
//!
//! # WHAT THE QUEUE IS FOR, AFTER 2026-09-18 (CEO ruling §52)
//!
//! *"There's nothing that ever not lands on its own here in the terminal … So, yes, always
//! land on its own."* Until that ruling, the one thing this queue reliably held was a
//! background lease's `mcp__richos_work__integrate` call, and the whole "ready for you to
//! approve" state was built around it. It is now granted to a background lease outright,
//! beside the four work tools that were already allowed, so **no land ever reaches this
//! desk**.
//!
//! The queue is unchanged and it is not vestigial: it exists for a request the desk would
//! have put in front of him in a visible turn and cannot, because there is no turn — a
//! `Bash` command, a write outside the workspace, any tool with no standing grant. That is
//! the whole of its remaining purpose, and every test below that used `integrate` as its
//! convenient example of a waiting request now uses one of those instead, because an
//! example that no longer waits would have quietly turned each of those tests green for the
//! wrong reason.
