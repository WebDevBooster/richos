//! THE OPERATOR DESK — his team, wired into the running app (operator back-end spec r3 (g),
//! (d), (m), (o), (q), (s), with r4 winning where they differ; the app side's record, richos-hq
//! `docs/verification/2026-09-25-operator-client/README.md` §7 items 1-3).
//!
//! **What it is for, in his words.** §86: *"Your setup as-is"* — his existing team runs behind
//! the app, so the app can be his daily driver instead of the terminal. `operator_host.rs`
//! decides how one lead per conversation is driven. This file is what the SHELL holds: it takes
//! each assignment the front desk writes down and hands it to that conversation's lead instead
//! of a work lease, it carries his stops, his Esc and his reads to the host, it retires idle
//! leads on a timer, and it ends his team at quit.
//!
//! **Operator mode is decided once, at launch.** The shell builds a desk only when
//! `operator.json` passed the gate as the app started, so an install without the file runs the
//! product path byte for byte (N1). After launch the gate is read again for every assignment,
//! and a declaration that broke, changed or disappeared refuses the assignment in one sentence.
//! **Nothing here ever falls back to the customer's work lease** (Frank's B8): a present
//! declaration never becomes the product path by accident, and a declaration that appears after
//! launch is refused by the shell's own gate arm (`spawn_work`), never half-honored.
//!
//! **The rules, each a test in this file:**
//!
//! 1. **An assignment is relayed with its handle, his own words, and the origin the ledger
//!    recorded for the turn that gave it** (item 3: the host receives `Origin` from the spine,
//!    not from the walk). Words the register's digest does not attest are never relayed, the
//!    product's own rule (`work_host.rs` `instruction_for`: *"The original request could not
//!    be verified. Nothing was started."*).
//! 2. **Relayed off the caller's thread.** A lead's first start (claim, process, handshake) is
//!    seconds; it never sits inside his send. Order within the desk is kept.
//! 3. **Work from a mouth that is not listed, or never recorded, is not relayed** ((s) rules 1
//!    and 4), and the assignment is closed with the sentence, its obligation withdrawn.
//! 4. **The gate is re-read per assignment**: broken, changed or gone refuses; never a fallback.
//! 5. **The per-assignment Stop stops exactly that assignment's agents** ((d) item 5) and says
//!    so; it marks the assignment stopped only when every one of them is NOT-ALIVE.
//! 6. **Quit ends every lead by the quit path, then releases the claim, once** ((q) item 2, e
//!    item 3); nothing is taken after it.
//! 7. **A lead with nothing running is retired on a timer** ((q) item 4), and the timer spends
//!    nothing while no lead runs.
