//! THE OPERATOR HOST — one lead per conversation, relaying and never holding (operator back-end
//! spec r3 §4 (g), (c), (d), (o), (q), (r), (s), e4, with r4 §1-§3; richos-hq
//! `docs/plans/2026-09-25-operator-back-end-spec-r4.md`).
//!
//! **What it is for, in his words.** Two Riches: *"each conversation thread always holds one
//! front desk Rich and one back-end Rich. Regardless of the number of assignments"*, and his
//! choice for this Mac (§86): *"Your setup as-is"*. So each conversation given work gets its own
//! lead — his `claude`, seated in his entity with his rules — and this host is the only thing
//! between the front desk and it.
//!
//! **The rules, each a test in this file:**
//!
//! 1. **Relay, never hold ((g)).** A message is written to the lead the moment it arrives; the
//!    CLI queues it and takes it after the running turn (P13's control). There is no host queue
//!    and no "one assignment at a time" — that is the product runner's shape, not his.
//! 2. **Only a report settles an assignment ((c)).** A turn ending never does. An `outcome` or
//!    `failed` report on a handle closes that obligation through the engine's `operator-complete`
//!    verb ([`Settle`]), with every land already checked in Git by the report server.
//! 3. **His lead's own words reach him ((c), B5 edge).** A turn's final text is delivered —
//!    on the handle whose message started the turn, or on the conversation for a turn the
//!    platform started — unless it is the text of that turn's last report.
//! 4. **Phone words never become work (s), and answers are not phone words (§88).** An
//!    assignment from an origin the declaration does not list is not relayed; a turn with no
//!    origin relays nothing; a stop is accepted from every channel; and an answer to his team's
//!    question reaches the lead from any channel through [`OperatorHost::deliver_answer`], the
//!    seam PRD S6's question store calls.
//! 5. **A named stop stops the name and nothing else ((d), §67),** then tells his registry
//!    (r4 §2.1, item 3a) once the stream says `stopped` AND `agent-liveness.sh` says NOT-ALIVE.
//! 6. **Nothing but a positive signal ends a lead ((q)).** Errors are reported and the lead is
//!    kept; an end not caused by quit or retirement is logged with its cause.
//! 7. **An alarm reaches him once, across every lead ((r)).**
//!
//! **What it deliberately does not do.** It never sets `priority` (r4 §1.3), never closes a
//! lead's input while an agent of it is alive (r4 §1.2), never re-dispatches anything after a
//! crash (reference ledger row §2.6), and never decides the land: the lead and his engine do.
