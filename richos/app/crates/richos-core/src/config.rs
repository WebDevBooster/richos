//! Durable CEO-facing configuration — company identity + the assertiveness dial.
//!
//! Persisted to a small JSON file, deliberately SEPARATE from the ledger's append-only
//! event log (this is mutable point-in-time state, not an event stream) but stored
//! "alongside the ledger's storage" per the task brief — i.e. in the same app data dir,
//! same durability posture (survives restart), same file-based substrate.
//!
//! Four seams live here:
//!   - `company_name` — the UX direction doc §2.1: "Rail header = the company/CEO identity,
//!     not RichOS." Configurable, persisted, sensible fallback when unset (§4.4/P4
//!     provisioning is the eventual "create your company" flow; this is the plumbing
//!     it will write into, wired ahead of that UI existing).
//!   - `assertiveness` — UX doc §5.2: one plain 3-way dial ("How much should Rich
//!     interrupt you?" Quiet / Balanced / Only when it's urgent). Default = Quiet
//!     (per the CEO decision: the acceptable failure mode is "too quiet," never
//!     "annoying"). Survives restart.
//!   - `splash_enabled` — the opening screen's off switch. It lives HERE, beside the
//!     assertiveness dial, because it is the same kind of thing: a durable CEO
//!     preference about how the product behaves toward him, not view state.
//!   - `techy_default` + `techy_entities` + `techy_threads` — the techy-mode toggle
//!     (`richos-hq/docs/plans/richos-techy-mode-2026-08-26.md` §3.1), THREE TIERS since
//!     2026-09-18. Rendering only: routing and retention run ALWAYS (§3.2), which is the
//!     only reason "turn the technical view on for a conversation I already had" is
//!     possible at all.
//!   - `raw_retention` — how long the stored output of that technical view survives
//!     (§7.2). It is here for the same reason as everything above it: a mutable
//!     point-in-time preference about how the product behaves toward him. It was two
//!     `const`s in `journal.rs` until 2026-08-30; see the §7.2 note below.
//!
//! WHY THE SWITCH IS NOT OPTIONAL, stated where the field is rather than in a design
//! doc nobody reads at the call site: the splash's failure mode is SILENT. Nobody
//! writes in to say a splash screen was beneath them — they switch it off, and if
//! there is nothing to switch, they resent it quietly and we learn nothing
//! (`docs/design/richos-splash-micro-game-2026-08-30.md` §7, richos-hq). So the
//! switch is the instrument, and `splash_first_shown_at` / `splash_disabled_at` are
//! the two timestamps that make §7's primary metric — time-to-disable — actually
//! derivable rather than gestured at. They are MEASUREMENT, never display: §5 of the
//! same document bans every counter, streak and score from the CEO's screen, and
//! nothing reads these two fields back to him.
//!
//! ## Why the toggle is here and not a ledger event (§3.1)
//! It is mutable point-in-time PREFERENCE, which is exactly what this file's first
//! paragraph says the store exists for. A toggle flipped twenty times would otherwise
//! write twenty immutable facts into a log whose job is conversational truth.
//!
//! ## §7.1 WAS THE CEO'S QUESTION AND HE ANSWERED IT ON 2026-09-18
//! *"Global default, or per-thread only?"* was open (open-items 1.4) and the answer is
//! BOTH, plus a tier neither option had. In his words:
//!
//! > "By default (on first app start) the techy mode is off. But when the user toggles
//! > the techy mode on while being inside a conversation thread, then there should be
//! > something like a radio button choice between 3 choices. And those choices could be
//! > something like 1) "For all threads in all companies" 2) "For all threads in this
//! > company" 3) "For this thread only". And the first choice should be preselected
//! > after the user switches the techy mode on. That also means that later the user
//! > should be able to switch off the techy mode for a given company or a given thread."
//!
//! So the store holds THREE tiers and [`ConfigStore::techy_mode`] resolves them in one
//! order — thread pin, else company pin, else `techy_default` — while
//! [`ConfigStore::apply_techy_scope`] is the single writer that takes one of his three
//! radio buttons and leaves the store in a state that agrees with it. The shape did not
//! have to change to carry his answer, which is what the old wording here was betting on:
//! a tier is a map, `None` still means "follow the tier above me", and the clearing
//! setters ([`ConfigStore::clear_techy_thread`], [`ConfigStore::clear_techy_entity`]) are
//! what make his "switch it off for a given company or a given thread" reversible in both
//! directions instead of one.
//!
//! ## §7.2 IS ALSO THE CEO'S QUESTION AND IS ALSO NOT ANSWERED HERE
//! *"How long do raw payloads survive?"* is open (open-items 1.4), and this file does not
//! decide it. It removes the reason the question was not neutral: "14 days" was
//! `RAW_RETENTION_DAYS` in `journal.rs` and "forever" was a developer's edit, so the
//! status quo was the only answer that cost nothing. Now every answer costs a click, the
//! shipping default reproduces yesterday's behaviour exactly, and [`RetentionChoice`]
//! carries a `Custom` arm precisely so that a value nobody put on a menu is still a value
//! the store can hold and the surface can report honestly rather than round to the nearest
//! button.
