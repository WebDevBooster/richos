//! The SPINE — the durable Rich that owns the conversation and the CEO's attention.
//!
//! Ties together: the ledger (durable conversation + action record), the thread data
//! model (topic views over the shared ledger), the current compute lease (a swappable
//! `Cognition`), the turn-boundary controller (queue-not-interrupt), the re-prime seam,
//! **app-owned turn-boundary rotation on a context watermark**, **mid-turn-crash
//! recovery/replay**, and **the proactive-attention seam**. The lease is disposable;
//! THIS is Rich.
//!
//! ## Concurrency note (why rotation can never race a CEO message)
//! Every method here takes `&mut self`. The Tauri shell holds the one `Spine` behind a
//! `Mutex`, so exactly one command (`send_message`, rotation, recovery — all of it) runs
//! at a time; a message that "arrives during rotation" simply blocks on that mutex until
//! rotation's synchronous call stack returns, then proceeds normally against the fresh
//! lease. This is the mechanism that satisfies continuity §3.3's "a message that arrives
//! during rotation is queued" — no separate queuing code needed for that case (the
//! `queue: VecDeque<Queued>` field below handles the DIFFERENT case: a message arriving
//! while a TURN, not a rotation, is in flight).
