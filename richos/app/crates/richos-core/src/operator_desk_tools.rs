//! THE FRONT DESK'S OPERATOR TOOLS — `richos_operator.stop`, `.read` and `.interrupt` (operator
//! back-end spec r3 (d), (o), with r4 §1.2; the operator-client record's §7 item 2).
//!
//! **What they are for, in his words.** §67: *"A stop from him, in any wording … is
//! unconditional for the agents his words name, and for no other."* His team runs behind the
//! front desk, so the front desk needs a way to reach it that is not the lead's model: a named
//! stop goes to the named agent in seconds (r3 (d)), "stop what you're doing" ends his team's
//! turn without its agents (his Esc, (d) item 6), and "what is my team doing" is answered from
//! the host's own record ((o)).
//!
//! **Two halves, because the front desk's tools run in a child process.** Every app-owned tool
//! on the front desk is this executable, spawned by `claude` over stdio and reading a scope the
//! app wrote for the turn (`assignment_tools.rs`, `status_tools.rs`). Those tools only read or
//! write records on disk; these must reach the LIVE host, which holds each lead's input. So the
//! app serves a Unix socket ([`DeskSocket`]) and the child ([`run_stdio`]) speaks one JSON line
//! to it per call. The socket lives in the app's own data folder (or, when that path is longer
//! than macOS's 103-character socket limit, under the per-user temporary folder), mode 0600,
//! and every request carries a token the app generated at launch and wrote only into the
//! 0600 scope: a process that cannot read the app's scope cannot use it.
//!
//! **The doctrine lines travel with the tools** (the server's `instructions` and each tool's
//! description), so a front desk that has these tools has their rules. The operator contract
//! and the front desk's addendum (r3 (a)) are Sage's text; these lines are the minimum the
//! tools cannot be used safely without, and the addendum, when it exists, extends them.
