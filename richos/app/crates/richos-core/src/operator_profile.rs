//! THE OPERATOR PROFILE — the arguments and the environment his lead starts with, and the
//! check it must pass before it takes any work (operator back-end spec r2 (b), (h), (i), (j),
//! (k), (n), with r3 §11 items 3-5; richos-hq `docs/plans/2026-09-24-operator-back-end-spec-r3.md`).
//!
//! **A separate type, never an [`crate::engine_profile::EngineProfile`]** (r3 (b)). Nothing in
//! here reads, calls or copies `EngineProfile::configure`: that function points a child at the
//! app's own engine, its own partition of state and its own Git identity, which is exactly
//! what his team must never run with.
//!
//! ## One engine: his live one, and none of the app's
//!
//! - `--setting-sources user,project,local`, so his `CLAUDE.md`, his settings and his plugin
//!   registration load natively, as they do in his terminal.
//! - No `--plugin-dir`, so `richos-app-engine` is never offered; [`init_check`] refuses a
//!   session that lists it anyway, and one that lists `richos-engine` other than exactly once.
//! - No `RICHOS_PROJECTS_DIR`, `RICHOS_SESSIONS_DIR` or any other app partition variable,
//!   because the environment is built from empty ([`OperatorProfile::environment`]).
//! - The supervisor is `provider-supervisor.py` from HIS declared engine (B9), with
//!   `--reap-descendants` (r3 §11 item 5); the product invocation in `native.rs` is untouched.
//!
//! ## The environment, built from empty (r3 §11 item 3)
//!
//! `env_clear()`, then exactly: the names `enable.sh` stored from his terminal, `HOME` from the
//! declaration, `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` from `launchctl getenv`, `TMPDIR` from the per-user temporary
//! directory, and `RICHOS_OPERATOR_LEAD`. The supervisor adds `RICHOS_SESSION_PID`
//! (`provider-supervisor.py:22`). Nothing of the app's own environment reaches his lead: not a
//! nightly's scratch `HOME`, not its `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, not a planted `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
//! **`PATH` is the one stored at `enable.sh`**, so a tool installed later is invisible to his
//! team in the app until `enable.sh` runs again (r3 (i)).
