//! **Several Claude subscriptions, used one at a time** ("fill-first", the CEO 2026-10-04:
//! *"when the weekly Claude quota in one subscription is exhausted auto-switch to the other
//! Claude subscription and so on"*).
//!
//! Plan: richos-hq `docs/plans/2026-10-04-multi-subscription-fill-first.md` (Sage), with
//! Frank's review beside it and the CEO's answers in its §15.
//!
//! - **One Claude Code configuration folder per subscription** (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, the
//!   mechanism Anthropic documents as "Log in with multiple accounts"). Each folder is signed
//!   in with the stock `claude auth login`; RichOS never sees a credential.
//! - **Account 1 is the folder used today.** It has no folder of its own here (`folder: None`),
//!   so a lease on it inherits the app's environment exactly as before, and a user with one
//!   subscription sees no change.
//! - **Staying is fill-first:** the account in use stays in use until it must be left.
//! - **Left BEFORE the wall, never at it** (plan §15 answers 6-8; ruling §108). An account is
//!   left at a turn boundary, checked before EVERY turn from the freshest reading (the
//!   `rate_limit_event` the lease itself streamed when that is newer than the probe):
//!   - at normal speed, at **99% of its weekly window** (`resets::WEEKLY_THRESHOLD`), and at
//!     the pause threshold (**93%**) of its five-hour window when the setting is Switch (his
//!     answer 2; with Pause the five-hour window holds the workers exactly as before);
//!   - when usage speeds up a lot, EARLIER: the five-hour window whenever the measured speed
//!     would carry it to 100% before the next check, which is then one minute away instead
//!     of 5 (`quota::Reading`, plan answers 10 and 11; back to 93% once the speed is down);
//!     the weekly window 1 or 2 points earlier, at 98% or 97%, when the wait for the next
//!     check and a teammate's handoff would use more than 1 point (`Reading::weekly_point`,
//!     weekly-switch plan §1).
//! - **Choosing the next** (his answer 1): the one whose weekly window resets soonest, among
//!   accounts with room. No list-order option and no setting for it.
//! - **Choosing the first is his** (the CEO 2026-10-06, feedback item 8: *"I should be able to
//!   change/switch which account drains first"*): [`Accounts::use_first`] puts the account he
//!   picks in use. It is saved like any switch, so it survives a relaunch, and from then on it
//!   is left exactly as above: at 99% of its week, to the account whose week resets soonest.
//! - **All accounts gone:** work is held until the soonest reset among them (Frank's
//!   finding 2). A usage-limit refusal inside a turn (the backstop, for one turn that by itself
//!   uses up what remained) marks its account gone until its reset.
//!
//! This file decides and records; it spawns nothing. The quota service and the turn boundaries
//! call [`Accounts::evaluate`]; the lease factory reads [`Accounts::in_use`]; the spine and the
//! work host call [`Accounts::limit_reached`] when a lease is cut by a limit anyway.
