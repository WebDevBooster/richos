//! **WAITING FOR THE SCREEN** — the CEO's ruling §56, and the one thing in this file that is
//! a refusal rather than a feature.
//!
//! `richos-hq/wiki/ceo-decisions.md` §56 (2026-09-18), verbatim: *"I like that "Watch for the
//! Mac's screen to unlock" feature that you had running here. Should be added to the RichOS
//! app for automatic use when Rich needs it."*
//!
//! What he saw: candidate .8's walk could not start because the screen locked minutes after
//! launch, and a watcher outside the app — `ioreg -n Root -d1 -a | grep
//! CGSSessionScreenIsLocked`, polled every 10 s, exit on unlock — noticed the unlock and the
//! walk was relaunched. **The acceptance is his sentence: when Rich needs the screen and it is
//! locked, the app waits for the unlock on its own and carries on.**
//!
//! ## THE DECISION IS HERE AND THE READING IS IN THE SHELL
//!
//! Exactly the split [`crate::work_gate`] uses, for exactly its reason: `app/src-tauri`
//! carries the whole webview dependency tree and is deliberately detached from this
//! workspace, so a decision that lived there would be a decision this crate's test suite
//! could not reach. This module holds no syscall, links no framework and opens no file. It
//! takes readings through [`ScreenSource`] and decides what to do about them, and every rule
//! below is a unit test against a [`FakeScreen`].
//!
//! The real reader is `app/src-tauri/src/screen.rs`.
//!
//! ## THE POLARITY RULE, AND IT IS THE OPPOSITE OF THE UPDATE GATE'S
//!
//! [`crate::work_gate`] fails TOWARD waiting: there, a delayed update is a nuisance and
//! destroyed work is the defect, so `Unknown` blocks exactly as `Busy` does.
//!
//! **Here it is inverted, and the inversion is deliberate rather than an oversight.** A wait
//! for the screen has no deadline of its own — §56 is *"waits for the unlock"*, with no
//! timeout — so a reading this build cannot establish must NEVER block, or a Windows box, a
//! headless CI host or a future macOS that renames the key would strand every screen-bound
//! assignment forever with a sentence saying it is about to carry on. **Waiting is the defect
//! here, and the honest failure is to proceed.** So:
//!
//! | reading | blocks? | why |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`Screen::Locked`] | **yes** | positively read, and it is the whole case §56 is about |
//! | [`Screen::Unlocked`] | no | positively read |
//! | [`Screen::Unknown`] | **no** | nothing was established, and an unbounded wait on nothing is worse than trying |
//!
//! `display_asleep` is reported and **does not block** — see [`ScreenReading::display_asleep`].
//!
//! ## NOTHING HERE HAS A TIMER, AND THAT IS STRUCTURAL
//!
//! Same discipline as [`crate::reachability`]: this module spawns no thread and starts no
//! background poll. There is no `std::thread::spawn` in this file. A sample is taken only
//! inside [`ScreenWatch::wait_for_screen`], by the thread that is doing the waiting — so an
//! app with nothing screen-bound outstanding does not read the screen at all, ever, and
//! [`ScreenWatch::samples`] stays at zero. `nothing_polls_the_screen_until_something_waits`
//! pins it.
//!
//! ## THE POLL INTERVAL IS A MEASUREMENT, NOT A PREFERENCE
//!
//! Measured on this Mac on 2026-09-18 against the real reader, 2000 consecutive readings
//! (copy the session dictionary, look the key up, release): **298.4 µs per reading.**
//!
//! ```text
//!   one reading                                   298.4 µs      =  0.0002984 s
//!   at SCREEN_POLL = 2 s   0.0002984 / 2       =  0.00014920   =  0.014920 % of one core
//!   at the 10 s of the watcher he liked         =  0.00002984   =  0.002984 % of one core
//!   worst-case added latency                    =  one interval =  2 s
//! ```
//!
//! So 2 s costs 0.0149 % of one core **while a wait is outstanding and nothing at all
//! otherwise**, and gives a fifth of the latency of the 10-second watcher he described as the
//! thing he liked. That is the whole argument for the number.
//!
//! ## WHY THERE IS NO DISTRIBUTED-NOTIFICATION OBSERVER, STATED RATHER THAN LEFT AS A GAP
//!
//! The obvious alternative is `com.apple.screenIsLocked` / `com.apple.screenIsUnlocked` on
//! `NSDistributedNotificationCenter`. It is **deliberately not built**, and the arithmetic
//! above is the reason:
//!
//! 1. **It can buy at most 2 s of latency** against a cost of 0.0149 % of one core, and only
//!    while something is already waiting.
//! 2. **It cannot be the mechanism, only an optimization.** Those notifications are posted by
//!    `loginwindow` and are not delivered for every path into a locked session, which is why
//!    the brief that asked for them asked for a poll backstop in the same sentence. A
//!    mechanism that needs a backstop to be correct is the backstop.
//! 3. **It would cost real unsafety for that 2 s**: a block-based observer, retained across
//!    threads, with an `NSOperationQueue` and a run loop, inside a `Send + Sync` source.
//!
//! A poll that is already correct does not get an unreliable fast path bolted onto it. If the
//! 2 s is ever shown to matter, the interval is one constant.
