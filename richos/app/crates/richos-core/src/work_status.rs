// THE LAND RECORD, READ OFF THE RECEIPTS — CEO ruling §52, 2026-09-18
// =======================================================================================
//
// *"There's nothing that ever not lands on its own here in the terminal … So, yes, always
// land on its own."* A job that lands on its own has to be able to tell him WHAT it landed,
// and this is where that comes from.
//
// **The engine writes the land into the work receipt, and the app reads it there rather
// than anywhere else.** `integrate` records `integration = {reviewer_id, commit, branch,
// before, verified}` on the worker's receipt under this repository's land lock, at the
// moment the ref actually moved, and saves it into
// `<state>/work-receipts/sha256([entity,thread])/<id>.json`
// (`richos/engine/mega-lander/app.py:809-836`, `:81`). That file is already partitioned by
// company and thread, so a land can never be read across a company boundary — which is
// exactly why it, and not the engine's own `.lands` history beside the repository lock, is
// the source here. That history is keyed by REPOSITORY and holds every conversation's
// lands; reading it would mean the app deciding which rows were its own.
//
// **Nothing in here infers a land.** `verified` is written by the engine after a
// fast-forward it performed; absence of `verified` is absence of a land, never a failure;
// and the reviewer's verdict is read off the REVIEWER's own receipt rather than taken from
// the fact that a land happened, because "the engine would not have landed it without a
// passing review" is a claim about the engine and this is a report about evidence.
