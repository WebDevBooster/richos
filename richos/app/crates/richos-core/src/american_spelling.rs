//! **AMERICAN SPELLING, FIXED MECHANICALLY IN THE TEXT RICHOS GIVES HIM** — no model involved.
//!
//! The CEO, 2026-09-27 (richos-hq `wiki/ceo-decisions.md` §93): *"The goal is to have a guard
//! that is as fast as possible and eliminates the need for slow inference as much as possible
//! i.e. automates as much as possible on this matter."* And from his input file: *"I just want
//! to eliminate British spelling from the front-end output."* 99% is his bar, not 100%.
//!
//! # The data
//!
//! One committed table, `engine/scripts/lib/dialect/dialect-en-US.generated.dict`, compiled
//! in with `include_str!` the way `richos-voice` compiles in `model-pins.json`. It is
//! generated from VarCon's verified clusters (a MODIFIED version of VarCon, and its header says
//! so; the notices ship with the app, see `docs/legal/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`). Every key and
//! every value is lowercase ASCII letters and no key is hex-only, so a commit SHA can never
//! match one (the suite checks both). A form that is also the preferred American spelling in
//! some sense is not in the table at all, so "ambiguous" is decided by the data, not here.
//!
//! # The context rules
//!
//! A word is changed only when all of these hold. Each is decided from the characters already
//! seen plus a few characters of lookahead, never by judgment:
//!
//! - it is outside fenced code (a line opening with three or more backticks or tildes, closed
//!   by a run at least as long), outside a code span (a backtick run, closed by a run of the
//!   same length), outside a `>` line, and outside a double-quoted run (straight or curly). A
//!   blank line resets the code-span and quotation state, so an unbalanced mark costs at most
//!   one paragraph of missed fixes, which is the safe direction. Single quotes are not tracked,
//!   because apostrophes make them undecidable.
//! - its token (the run of letters, digits and `_ $ . / : \ -` around it, the same token
//!   `guard-dialect.sh` uses) does not look like a path, URL, identifier or dotted name: no
//!   `/`, `\`, `_`, `$`, `::`, `--`, and no `.` followed by a letter. A bare single-hyphen
//!   compound in prose is still fixed, which the plan check accepts inside the 99%.
//! - it is a whole word: no digit, underscore or other letter (accented ones included)
//!   touching it.
//! - it is all lowercase, all capitals, or capitalized. A capitalized word is changed only at
//!   the start of a sentence, because a capital mid-sentence is a name (a party, a ministry, a
//!   venue). At the start of a sentence a capitalized word followed by a possessive `'s` is
//!   also left, because that is a name too (a television title heading a sentence). The one
//!   price, measured on the keyed sample: a capitalized common word mid-sentence, as in a
//!   title-case heading's second word, stays as written.
//!
//! # Streaming, and his first word
//!
//! [`Speller::push`] takes the deltas exactly as the model streams them and returns the text
//! that is decided. It holds back ONLY a word that could still change: a trailing letter run
//! that is the start of some key, or a key whose token has not ended (the next characters could
//! still make it a path). Every other character goes out at once, so a delta that ends in
//! whitespace or punctuation holds nothing, and a delta that ends inside a word holds that word
//! for one delta at most. Backtick and tilde runs are held until the run ends, because one
//! backtick and three backticks mean different things. [`Speller::finish`] releases everything;
//! the drain calls it on every exit from the turn.
//!
//! **Streaming never changes the answer.** Every decision is made only once the characters it
//! depends on have arrived, so the concatenated output of any split of a text equals [`fix`] of
//! the whole text (the suite proves it at every split point of the keyed sample). A
//! [`Speller::finish`] in the middle of a text (the drain calls it before a tool call is shown)
//! is an end of text, and that is the only way the two can differ.
//!
//! # Where it is applied
//!
//! - **Replies**, at the one drain where streamed text becomes a [`crate::native::TurnItem`]
//!   (`NativeClient::prompt`). Everything downstream of the ledger inherits the fixed text: the
//!   Mac's screen, speech, crash recovery, the phones and both kinds of push preview.
//! - **Documents the app's sessions write** (Write, Edit, MultiEdit and NotebookEdit into prose
//!   files), in the desktop executable's `PreToolUse` wrapper: [`fix_tool_input`].
//!
//! **His own words never pass through here.** His typed and spoken input is recorded by
//! `record_prompt_received*` and sent to the model as written; nothing on those paths calls this
//! module (the drain's tests prove the prompt reaches the child byte for byte).
//!
//! **The model's own transcript keeps what the model wrote** while the ledger holds the fixed
//! form. Nothing compares the two for display, so this is harmless; it is stated here so nobody
//! is surprised by it.
