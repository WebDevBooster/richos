//! richos-core — the RichOS runtime SPINE.
//!
//! The load-bearing leg of the RichOS front-end (the front-end architecture,
//! the front-end architecture plan, 2026-08-24, Phase 1). UI-agnostic and
//! native-dependency-free so it builds + tests fast and the Tauri shell (src-tauri/)
//! is a thin consumer.
//!
//! Pieces:
//!   - `entity`    — the ENTITY scope/privacy boundary: entity ids, the registry, the
//!                   immutable thread binding and the fail-closed root resolver (ECS §3.2–3.4).
//!   - `ledger`    — durable, append-only conversation + action LEDGER (crash-safe).
//!   - `thread`    — topic threads as VIEWS over the one shared ledger.
//!   - `cognition` — the swappable compute-lease seam (+ a test mock).
//!   - `native`    — the real compute-lease client: RichOS drives the NATIVE `claude`
//!                   binary over its stream-json stdio. No ACP adapter, no Node, no npm
//!                   anywhere under `app/` (CEO ruling, `wiki/ceo-decisions.md` §16).
//!   - `reprime`   — the session-continuity re-prime payload (foundation).
//!   - `loro`      — the Tier-C READ seam, implemented: company memory compiled into a
//!                   re-prime, with the cross-entity lane re-assertion on the finished
//!                   slice — and the PROVENANCE of what was injected, retained so a later
//!                   correction can name the record it is a correction of.
//!   - `correction` — the loro WRITE loop: propose, ASK the CEO, then write. Never the
//!                   other order — ceo-decisions.md §7, enforced by the state machine.
//!   - `belief`    — the loro desk's PROPOSER: what makes an utterance a correction of a
//!                   recorded BELIEF, and — the load-bearing half — which record it is a
//!                   correction of. Resolves or stays silent; never guesses a ref.
//!   - `spoken`    — the flywheel's AUTOMATIC TRIGGER: what makes an utterance a
//!                   correction, decided from a repair frame + the shipped §7 term gate.
//!                   Detects; never writes.
//!   - `staging`   — where a detected spoken correction LANDS: durable candidates and
//!                   §7's three outcomes. The only path to a vocabulary write is a human
//!                   answer; there is no threshold that reaches one.
//!   - `skip`     — ONE vocabulary for a record on disk this build could not read,
//!                   shared by the ledger and the intake log so they cannot drift apart
//!                   about what is damage and what was written by a newer RichOS.
//!   - `steering`  — the CEO's two mid-turn controls (UX §9.2/§9.3): the durable intake
//!                   log and the cancel seam, both reachable WITHOUT the spine lock.
//!   - `stream`    — the live, UI-facing turn events (streaming deltas + turn state).
//!   - `live`      — the ADDITIVE live-work event family (UX brief §13): typed turn status,
//!                   message phase, and semantic activity, beside `stream` — never replacing it.
//!   - `machinery` — the SECOND event family: every non-text agent frame, routed not dropped.
//!   - `journal`   — the per-thread, day-sharded machinery journal (separate store; not the ledger).
//!   - `timeline`  — the TYPED TIMELINE records (UX brief §12): the projection a renderer
//!                   reads, with entity scope on every item and visibility as a gate.
//!   - `reachability` — CAN CLAUDE BE REACHED **AT THE SIZE THE WORK IS**? A degraded API
//!                   fails the expensive requests first, so a verdict of "reachable" cannot
//!                   be constructed by a probe smaller than the measured floor. Row 3.30.
//!   - `upstream`  — the UPSTREAM MODEL-API failure vocabulary: `529` overload vs `429`
//!                   quota, classified from the vendor's own structural tokens, with the
//!                   bounded+visible retry budget and the what-survived statement.
//!                   Row 3.30, measured 2026-09-03.
//!   - `spine`     — ties it together: queue-not-interrupt, turn-boundary, re-prime seam,
//!                   turn-boundary rotation, mid-turn-crash recovery, the proactive seam.
//!   - `config`    — durable CEO-facing preferences: company name, the assertiveness dial.
//!   - `worker_events` — the CONSUMER of the engine's worker-lifecycle stream: the four
//!                     states it can witness, and the three it refuses to invent.
//!   - `worker_status` — the optional AI-worker drill-down, read from the engine's event logs.
//!   - `feedback`  — the in-app feedback channel's LOCAL half: the rating prompt, its
//!                   on-disk persistence, and the VERSIONED CLOSED VOCABULARY a report is
//!                   assembled from — a payload with no free-text field anywhere in it, so
//!                   the user's specifics are unrepresentable rather than filtered out.
//!                   Nothing in it sends anything, and its tests assert that.
