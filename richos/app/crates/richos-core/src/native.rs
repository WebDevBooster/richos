//! The NATIVE CLIENT — RichOS drives the `claude` binary directly over stream-json stdio.
//!
//! **This file replaces `acp.rs`.** CEO ruling 2026-08-31, `wiki/ceo-decisions.md` §16:
//! *"the adapter goes"*. RichOS is Claude; the ACP adapter's whole value was portability to
//! backends this product has declined, and it cost 112 resolved npm packages across ~99
//! publishers that the CEO's own Developer ID would have vouched for.
//!
//! Same transport SHAPE as the file it replaces — newline-delimited JSON over a child's
//! stdio, one reader thread, an mpsc into the turn loop, one auto-approve seam — with a
//! different message vocabulary. The wire was captured before a line of this was written:
//! `docs/verification/native-claude-stream-json-2026-08-31/` (twelve runs, raw JSONL
//! committed unedited) and `docs/verification/native-claude-tool-status-2026-08-31/`.
//!
//! ```text
//!   spawn: claude --print --input-format=stream-json --output-format=stream-json
//!                 --include-partial-messages --verbose --setting-sources ''
//!                 --no-session-persistence --session-id <ours>
//!                 --permission-prompt-tool stdio
//!   control_request{initialize}          -> control_response{success}          [handshake]
//!   {"type":"user","message":{...}}      -> stream_event/assistant/user/... frames
//!                                        -> result {stop_reason, terminal_reason, usage}
//!   control_request{can_use_tool}        <- the agent asks; we answer (the seam, below)
//!   control_request{interrupt}           -> control_response, then a result
//! ```
//!
//! Auth = the customer's own `claude` login. No `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: every spike run had it
//! removed from the environment (`env -u`) and the binary reported `apiKeySource: "none"`
//! and completed real turns on subscription OAuth.
//!
//! ## THE LICENCE CONDITION THIS FILE IS BUILT AROUND
//! **RichOS may never collect, store, or intermediate Claude credentials or session
//! tokens.** The customer signs in to the unmodified binary with their own subscription and
//! Anthropic bills them directly. This is a condition of the licence that permits RichOS to
//! exist in this shape (`docs/research/claude-code-redistribution-2026-08-31.md`;
//! `ceo-decisions.md` §16).
//!
//! Concretely, and these are design decisions rather than good intentions:
//!
//! - Nothing here reads the keychain, and nothing here sets or forwards an API key.
//! - The `initialize` handshake's reply carries an `account` object (email, organization,
//!   `subscriptionType`). [`NativeClient::handshake`] reads it for **liveness only** — it
//!   checks that a `success` came back and keeps NOTHING. It is not normalized into
//!   machinery, not logged, and not returned to any caller.
//! - So there is no login-status indicator, because the obvious way to build one would
//!   breach the condition. That is a named absence, not an oversight.
//!
//! ## THE UNDOCUMENTED FLAG, AND WHY THIS FILE CANNOT DEGRADE QUIETLY
//! `--permission-prompt-tool stdio` is what arms the `can_use_tool` channel, and it **does
//! not appear in `claude --help`** — re-verified 2026-08-31 against version **2.1.252**:
//! 274 lines of help, zero matches. The binary also self-updates: four versions sit in
//! `~/.local/share/claude/versions/` on this machine (2.1.246, 2.1.250, 2.1.251, 2.1.252),
//! and the 2026-08-31 spike ran against 2.1.251 — it moved WHILE this was being built.
//!
//! §16 accepted that risk and recorded the mitigation: a custom launcher at
//! `~/.local/bin/claude` survives auto-update, so the flag can be pinned without modifying
//! any binary (which also keeps the "must not be modified" licence condition intact).
//! [`resolve_claude_bin`] prefers that path for exactly this reason.
//!
//! **What this file guarantees, and it is the whole of the guarantee:**
//!
//! - The flag is in [`child_args`] unconditionally. There is no code path that drops it and
//!   continues, no env override that disables it, and no fallback client. `args_always_carry_the_permission_flag`
//!   pins that.
//! - A binary that REJECTS the flag is caught at [`NativeClient::spawn`], loudly, before any
//!   turn: an unknown option makes `claude` write `error: unknown option '<flag>'` to stderr
//!   and **exit 1 with zero bytes of stdout** (measured 2026-08-31 on 2.1.252, both for a
//!   nonsense flag and alongside a good one). The handshake turns that into
//!   [`NativeError::Startup`], carrying the child's own stderr verbatim.
//! - A missing binary is [`NativeError::BinaryMissing`], before a process is spawned — and
//!   ONLY a missing binary. A missing engine directory is [`NativeError::WorkingDirMissing`]
//!   and an unrunnable one is [`NativeError::BinaryNotExecutable`], because `ENOENT` from
//!   `Command::spawn` means either of the first two and reporting one as the other sends
//!   whoever set RichOS up looking in the wrong place. `preflight` separates them before a
//!   process exists.
//! - A binary that starts but never answers the handshake is [`NativeError::Startup`] after
//!   [`HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT`], never an indefinite hang.
//!
//! **What it does NOT guarantee, stated plainly rather than left to be discovered.** If the
//! flag is one day still ACCEPTED but silently stops arming the channel, nothing here
//! detects it at startup: the handshake would pass and the failure would surface only as a
//! tool that never runs. The `initialize` reply carries no field naming the permission
//! prompt tool (checked — 17 fields, none of them it), so there is nothing to assert
//! against. That is **unproven** and it is not fixable from this side.

/// Two documented fields, both quoted from the schema embedded in `claude` 2.1.277 — the
/// binary this product spawns (`/Users/alex/.local/share/claude/versions/2.1.277`, read with
/// `strings`):
///
/// - **`command_lifecycle`** — `{type, command_uuid, state, uuid, session_id}`, where
///   `command_uuid` is *"The queued command's uuid — the client-supplied uuid on the inbound
///   message. Commands enqueued without a uuid (e.g. the one-shot `-p "prompt"` string path)
///   emit no lifecycle events."* `state` is one of
///   `queued | started | completed | cancelled | discarded | refused`: *"'queued' when the
///   inbound message enters the command queue; 'started' when it drains into a turn; then
///   exactly one terminal state"*. Ordering against the result frame is per-path and the
///   schema says which: *"a command that starts a fresh turn emits 'completed' AFTER that
///   turn's result frame ...; a command folded into an already-in-flight turn emits
///   'completed' BEFORE that turn's result frame."* The session announces the capability as
///   `msg_lifecycle_v1` on its `system/init` frame — present in the 2026-08-31 captures
///   (`docs/verification/native-claude-stream-json-2026-08-31/raw/run2-multiturn-one-process.jsonl`,
///   line 1). **So this client stamps a `uuid` on every user message it writes** — an
///   optional field of the documented inbound schema — and the child names it back.
/// - **`queued_turn_count`** on the `result` frame — *"User-initiated sends still waiting in
///   the command queue when this result was produced. Greater than 0 means at least one more
///   user turn (and result) follows without further input, barring cancellation; 0 means none
///   is pending... System-generated queue entries are not counted."* The platform's own
///   injections ARE system-generated: the subagent hand-back enqueues with `isMeta: true`, so
///   does the worker/task notification, and the child's own counting predicate excludes
///   `isMeta` entries. This client's send is the only user-initiated one there can be,
///   because there is at most one parked prompt.
///
/// # THE INVARIANT
///
/// **A parked prompt is answered by the `result` of the turn that consumed the message it
/// sent, never by the next `result` to arrive.** A `result` reaches it only when the child
/// has said our message drained into a turn, or has said nothing of ours is waiting behind it
/// (`queued_turn_count == 0`). A `result` the child reports with a user send still queued
/// belongs to a turn that was already in flight: it is RETAINED on the between-turn lane
/// (§1.4 G5 — traffic is never dropped), and the prompt keeps waiting.
///
/// Frames arriving while our message is known to be still queued are retained the same way
/// rather than streamed into this turn, because they belong to the other turn. Attributing
/// them here is the false attribution §1.4 G4 forbids.
///
/// # WHERE IT DEGRADES, AND HOW
///
/// A child that emits no `command_lifecycle` for our uuid leaves the phase `Unconfirmed`, and
/// then `queued_turn_count` alone decides — weaker (a count, not an identity) and still
/// strictly better than "the next result wins". A child that offers NEITHER field does what
/// this file did before 2026-09-18: the next `result` is delivered. That is the honest floor,

    /// Two things were wrong with that, and the smaller one is the latency:

        // repeating four of the app's own words back to the app. So the app says them, here, the
        // instant the register's answer goes past on the wire.
        //
        // **It routes as TEXT, which is what makes one line reach all three surfaces.** The
        // timeline bubble, the status read and the speaker are all downstream of
        // `TurnItem::Text` — `ui/main.js`'s `rich://chunk` listener relays exactly this to

        // shared-sequence position, so a crash-recovered conversation shows the same words.

        // **Nothing here decides WHAT to say.** `first_reply::receipt_sentence` reads the
