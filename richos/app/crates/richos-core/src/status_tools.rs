//! The app-owned MCP endpoint the FRONT DESK LOOKS WITH — `richos_status.background_work`.
//!
//! **Why this exists, in one sentence: the CEO's Two Riches page takes the orchestration
//! tools away from the front desk, and without this the front desk would have nothing left
//! to answer "what is running" with.**
//!
//! The page's sense-check note 3 is *"The front desk gets no orchestration tools, so it
//! cannot drift into doing the work. … Status questions are answered from the shared record
//! at once."* Sage's check of that page (richos-hq
//! `docs/plans/two-riches-spec-2026-09-17-sage-check.md`, finding 6) names the consequence
//! nobody had built for: after the refusal, the conversation lease's remaining servers are
//! `richos_onboarding` and `richos_assignments`, and `richos_assignments` exposes one tool,
//! `record`, **which writes**. Every status surface this app has — `get_work_status`,
//! `take_work_notices`, the live assignment — is a Tauri command reaching the WEBVIEW. The
//! model never sees any of it. So "answered from the shared record at once" had no wire at
//! all.
//!
//! This is that wire, and it is deliberately the smallest thing that can be one.
//!
//! ## Three properties, and each one is a refusal of something easier
//!
//! 1. **It reads and it cannot do anything else.** There is no argument that selects a
//!    company, a conversation or a file: the scope the app wrote fixes all three, exactly
//!    as `assignment_tools.rs` fixes them for the write. There is no stop, no approve and
//!    no retry here — those are controls on his screen (the per-assignment stop, Approve
//!    and Decline) or they are relayed to the back end. **A front desk tool that ACTS would
//!    be the drift the page exists to prevent**, wearing the word "status".
//! 2. **It never calls the back end.** It opens files under the state root and returns
//!    what they say. A front desk that had to ask the back end a question would be blocked
//!    behind whatever the back end is doing, which is the one thing the CEO's page
//!    promises never happens: *"the CEO's conversation with Rich is never blocked by any
//!    work that's going on in the background."*
//! 3. **It answers about THIS conversation and no other.** His page assumes threads never
//!    overlap in subject (*"the CEO is not expected to ever run 2 conversation threads that
//!    are dealing with the exact same thing"*); a front desk that could read another
//!    thread's register would make one thread's answer depend on another thread's work.
//!
//! ## What it deliberately cannot see, said here rather than discovered later
//!
//! **A permission request that is waiting in the running app's desk is NOT in this
//! answer.** The desk is `permissions.rs`'s in-memory `PermissionDesk`, and this server
//! runs in its own short-lived process (the same shape `assignment_tools.rs` runs in), so
//! there is nothing in this process to ask. What IS here is the DURABLE half of the same
//! fact: an assignment that stopped at a decision of his is written to disk as
//! [`AssignmentState::Blocked`] with the step named in his words, and that is what
//! `waiting_for_you` reports. The two agree because the host writes the record when it
//! raises the question, and a reader that quoted a queue it could not see would be
//! inventing precision.
