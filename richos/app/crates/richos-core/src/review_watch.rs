//! **The host's review-watch child: the second review, started by itself, in the app.**
//!
//! Slice 4 of richos-hq `docs/plans/2026-10-09-automatic-second-review-and-t3-ideas.md`, with
//! Sage's check beside it (`...-sage-check.md` §1.3, §2 catch 7, §4 row 4). His words (ruling
//! §113): *"A regular RichOS user can never be expected anything even remotely close to that.
//! So, this all must be completely automated."*
//!
//! The engine's `review-watch` is a Claude Code plugin monitor, and neither of the app's two
//! kinds of lead can run one: a product lease loads no settings and no monitors
//! (`native.rs`, `--setting-sources ''`), and a monitor inside the operator install's print-mode
//! lead would start a turn the host never asked for and cannot attribute (`operator_lead.rs`
//! identifies a turn by the user message this host sent). So the HOST runs it, as its own
//! child, started at launch and ended at quit:
//!
//! * [`Mode::App`]: every install. `review_watch.py --app-state <engine-state>` reads the
//!   app's own registry and starts MID-JOB reviews of running workers (the handover review is
//!   the coordinator's reviewer, which `integrate` already requires). Its verdicts reach the
//!   running worker through the app's hook (`scripts/app-engine-hook.py`), so nothing it prints
//!   needs delivering; its output goes to a log. Each review runs on the Claude account the
//!   app's work runs on when its reviewer starts (`--accounts`, the app's account list).
//! * [`Mode::Operator`]: his team's install. `review_watch.py --host-json` against his
//!   governed repository's `orchestration.config`; each notice comes back as one JSON line per
//!   lead session, and the shell hands it to [`crate::operator_desk::OperatorDesk::tell_lead`],
//!   which sends it to that lead as a message of the host's own. **A verdict counts as delivered
//!   only once its lead was told** (the real second review of 0d83e456d, finding 3): the child is
//!   started with [`ACKS_ENV`] set, and for each notice the sink accepted the host writes the
//!   notice's review ids back on the child's stdin as `{"ack": [...]}`; a notice the desk
//!   refused gets no acknowledgment and is told again at the child's next look.
//!
//! **Its process id is recorded** (`<state>/review-watch/host-child-<mode>.json`) while it
//! runs, and the record goes when it has been stopped and reaped. **Stopping** is SIGTERM to
//! the leader, which stops the reviews it started (each in its own session, out of this
//! group's reach) and exits; the group SIGKILL follows only after [`STOP_BOUND`]. A child whose
//! app died without a quit notices on its own: it exits when its parent process id is no longer
//! this host's, which it is given at spawn ([`HOST_ENV`]), so an app that dies while the child is
//! still starting is noticed before its first look too.
