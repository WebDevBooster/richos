//! **BUST A BUG** — the core half. The CEO's §115 (2026-10-09), and the acceptance criterion:
//!
//! > *"When the user has Claude set up in the app (which is the expected default), we should just
//! > let the user say what's wrong and where and let their Rich check and articulate everything
//! > properly and then submit a GitHub issue on their behalf."* On whose account: *"when they have
//! > a GitHub account, the issue submission should happen from their GitHub account. And if they
//! > don't, then we can use a RichOS reporting account."*
//!
//! And on what is private (§115, later the same day): *"If it's so hard to automate this
//! particular part, then just let's the user's Rich check and clean-up what needs to be
//! cleaned-up in that particular user's case."* The order, as he set it: **the scanner runs
//! first, Rich runs last**, and nothing after Rich changes the words.
//!
//! The design is round 21 (`richos-hq/design/mockups/rounds/round-21/`, approved "go!"). This
//! file is everything about it that is not a window or a socket, so all of it is tested here:
//!
//!   - **The scanner, first** ([`Scrubber`]). Names RichOS holds (conversations, companies,
//!     people, folders), file paths, email addresses and every word Rich named private are replaced
//!     by plain stand-ins such as `[a conversation]`. Each stand-in keeps what it replaced in
//!     [`Segment::was`] for the tooltip only the user sees; `was` is never part of the issue. It is
//!     an extra help, and it cannot be relied on: no rule can know an ordinary client's name.
//!   - **Rich's write-up** ([`writer_prompt`], [`writer_args`], [`parse_written`], [`draft_from`]).
//!     One `claude --print` turn with no tools, under the account the conversation runs on, asked
//!     to write the report with this user's private details already left out.
//!   - **Rich, last** ([`finish_prompt`], [`finished`]). What the scanner made of the report is
//!     given to Rich once more, to clean up whatever private detail of this user's case is still
//!     there. **The card shows his words, and the issue is those words**, with only the escaping
//!     GitHub needs. **No report is offered for sending without him** ([`checked`]): when he cannot
//!     be had (an error, a timeout, an answer that is not a report), the user's words are kept on
//!     this Mac and Rich is asked again by himself until he answers ([`Outbox::keep_unless_checked`],
//!     [`Outbox::check_due`]).
//!   - **The issue, word for word** ([`Sheet`], [`issue_body`], [`issue_request`]). What goes to
//!     GitHub is rendered from the sheet the user approved and nothing else: no label, no footer,
//!     no attachment (round 21 "Left out, on purpose": no screenshot).
//!   - **What leaves this Mac, decided once** ([`at_send`], [`Public`]). The words sent are the
//!     card's, and they are words Rich gave last, to the character ([`Check`]). Words the user
//!     changed (by hand, or by telling Rich) go through the scanner and then Rich first, and his
//!     version is what is shown and sent. [`Outbox::send`] takes only what `at_send` made.
//!   - **Send, and keep what could not go** ([`Outbox`]). The report is written to this Mac BEFORE
//!     the request is made, so a failure, a quit or a crash leaves it here exactly as approved. A
//!     waiting report is tried again by itself ([`Outbox::send_due`]) and at once on *Try now*.
//!
//! # Which account
//!
//! [`Credentials`] answers "who is this filed as" at send time. The app has no GitHub sign-in yet
//! (§20 is not built), so the shell's implementation answers [`Account::Reporting`] with the token
//! read from the login keychain ([`KEYCHAIN_SERVICE`] / [`KEYCHAIN_ACCOUNT`]), or nothing when it
//! is not there. A signed-in user's own account slots in as [`Account::User`] in that one place;
//! the request, the outbox and the card already carry the account rather than assume it.
//!
//! # What this file does not do
//!
//! It opens no connection and starts no process. The shell (`src-tauri/src/bug_report.rs`) runs
//! `claude` and makes the HTTPS request through the [`Transport`] seam, so nothing here can reach
//! GitHub and the tests below the shell cannot either.

///     however it is written: "Zephyr" is a conversation's name when he says it is, and "secretco"
///     when he writes it so. The two rules below are guesses about names nobody has looked at,
///     and his word overrides them; where RichOS holds the same name in other capitals, his entry
///     is the one kept (review rv-20261009T172237Z-63b3f510-acf4 finding 1: on 63b3f5101 both
///     guesses left a name he had listed in the public report).
///   - A name of **two or more words** is matched in any letter case, in every alphabet ("acme
///     deal", "CAFÉ NORTH" for "Café North", [`fold_char`]).
///   - **An accented letter is one letter however it is encoded**: "é" as one character or as "e"
///     and a combining accent ([`folded`]). This holds for every rule here.
///   - A **one-word conversation name** is not matched at all (round 21 `privateTerms` does the
///     same): "Running" is a conversation in the demo and an ordinary word everywhere else.
///   - Any other **one-word name written Capitalized** ("Acme", "Deeply") is matched only where it
///     is written with a capital, so "deeply" in a sentence is left alone. One written in lower case
///     ("femcboost", a folder) is matched in any case, because it is not an ordinary word.
///   - Every match is a whole word: "Acmes" and "subAcme" are not "Acme".
///   - **Spacing is not part of a name**: any run of spaces, tabs or line breaks between its words
///     matches any run in the text, so "Jane\nDoe" listed is "Jane Doe" written, and the other way
///     round ([`needle_of`]). At least one is still needed: "JaneDoe" is one word.
///   - **File paths**: any word with a `/` or a `\` in it, except a web address (`https://…`, with no `\`),
///     "and/or", "w/", "w/o", "n/a", "24/7", and an all-digit fraction or date ("1/2", 10/09/2026).
///     The whole line it is on is left out, so no space, comma, bracket, quote or ". " in a
///     file's name, before the slash or after it, leaves a piece behind ([`find_paths`]).
///   - Where two of these overlap, both are left out as one.
