//! THE OUTPUT RECORD — every file a thread produced, written down by a witness.
//!
//! The PRD is richos-hq `docs/prds/2026-10-05-output-side-panel.md` (§3, §4); this module is its
//! slice S1 (§12.1). The panel that shows the list is a view; the thing this module keeps is
//! **one append-only file per thread**, `<app-data>/output/<thread_id>.jsonl`, with one row per
//! WITNESSED WRITE ([`WriteRow`]), projected on read into one [`Entry`] per file.
//!
//! # Witnessed, never inferred
//!
//! A file is listed because something SAW the thread write it, never because Rich said so
//! (§1.6, §4.1). Four witnesses feed the record and nothing else may:
//!
//! - **(a)** the front desk's own completed `Write`/`Edit`/`MultiEdit`/`NotebookEdit` calls,
//!   merged per call from the machinery journal ([`witness_tool_calls`]);
//! - **(b)** the app hook's `PostToolUse` rows for the same four tools, in both leases and every
//!   worker (slice S2);
//! - **(c)** files a shell command made, seen on the disk by the hook (slice S2);
//! - **(d)** a worker's files landed into the connected repository, written by `integrate` itself
//!   (slice S2b). A land row retires the worktree copy it came from ([`project`]).
//!
//! # Identity
//!
//! A row is idempotent by its `key` (§4.4): appending a key the file already holds is a no-op,
//! so the live witness, the turn-end projection and convergence can all offer the same write
//! and it is one row. An entry is one CANONICAL path (§4.3): a file written in three turns is one
//! entry under the latest turn with `writes: 3`.
//!
//! # Every read re-stats (§4.6)
//!
//! `exists`, `bytes` and `modifiedAt` are read from the disk at projection time and never stored.
//! A deleted or moved file stays listed with `exists: false`: it is a file the thread produced,
//! and that it is gone is a fact about the Mac, not about the thread. A path that is now a
//! symbolic link, not a regular file, or a different file than the one witnessed is REFUSED at
//! projection ([`Refusal`]): it is listed, and nothing about it is read through the link.
//!
//! # Durability (§4.7)
//!
//! Append + flush, no fsync — the machinery journal's posture (`journal.rs:27`), for the same
//! reason: the sources stay the truth and the record is a converging cache of them, so a lost
//! line costs a re-projection, never a file. A write failure never fails a turn.
