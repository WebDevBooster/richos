//! **WHY A TURN ENDED WITHOUT FINISHING — the vocabulary, and the one place it is decided.**
//!
//! `docs/verification/2026-09-17-nightly-1.2.0-20260917.1-onscreen-audit.md` §D2. The
//! published nightly wrote this to its own ledger:
//!
//! ```text
//! {"event":"TurnInterrupted","turn_id":"turn_afe3ad4a…",
//!  "reason":"cognition protocol: \"Not logged in · Please run /login\"", …}
//! ```
//!
//! and showed the CEO this:
//!
//! > **Stopped after 1s**
//! > I hit a snag mid-thought and had to stop — say the word and I'll pick it back up.
//! > Everything I'd already written above is saved.
//! > \[Pick it back up\]
//!
//! **The app had the exact, actionable cause and showed him something else.** Three separate
//! untruths in four lines: a permanent condition described as a passing hiccup; a promise
//! about saved work when nothing had been written; and a retry control for a state no number
//! of retries can clear. The audit's own note on why this outlives its harness is the reason
//! this module exists: *"not logged in is not an exotic state — it is where every expiring
//! subscription session lands."*
//!
//! # WHAT THIS MODULE DECIDES, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO DECIDE
//!
//! It answers one question — *"which KIND of ending was this?"* — and it answers
//! [`InterruptionCause::Unknown`] rather than guessing. It is the sibling of
//! [`crate::upstream`], which answers the same shape of question about the model API, and it
//! is deliberately NOT an arm of that enum: a `claude` that refuses locally because nobody is
//! signed in never reached Anthropic, so filing it under "upstream" would be the exact
//! dishonesty that module's header warns against.
//!
//! # IT IS KEYED ON THE VENDOR'S OWN CONSTANTS, READ OUT OF THE SHIPPED BUNDLE
//!
//! There is no status code or error tag on this path — `native.rs` builds
//! `CognitionError::Protocol` from the `result` frame's `result` string, so the only thing
//! RichOS holds is the sentence Claude Code wrote. That sentence is not guessed at here. It
//! was read verbatim out of the installed bundle
//! (`~/.local/share/claude/versions/2.1.274`, 2026-09-17), where the whole family sits
//! together as adjacent constants:
//!
//! ```js
//! gVe="Not logged in \xB7 Please run /login",
//! HEe="Invalid API key \xB7 Fix external API key",
//! Qwn="Invalid auth token \xB7 Fix external auth token",
//! Zwn="Invalid ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS \xB7 Fix the environment variable",
//! Jwn="Invalid request header from the environment \xB7 Fix the environment variable"
//! ```
//!
//! **Those five are two different problems with two different actors**, which is why they are
//! two arms below. The first is the CEO's own account. The other four are a credential
//! somebody put in this machine's environment, and the person who can fix one of those is
//! whoever set RichOS up — telling the CEO to reconnect his account would send him to a
//! screen that cannot help.
//!
//! **A reworded vendor string falls to [`InterruptionCause::Unknown`], and that is the safe
//! direction**: Unknown says plainly that RichOS does not know why, which is true, and offers
//! no route that might be wrong. It never silently becomes the arm that looked closest.
//!
//! # NOTHING HERE EVER CLAIMS SOMETHING SURVIVED THAT DID NOT
//!
//! [`InterruptionRecord::new`] builds its loss sentence from [`crate::upstream::TurnLoss`] —
//! counts read off the ledger at the instant of the failure — and when nothing of Rich's had
//! been written it says nothing about saved work at all. The sentence the audit caught,
//! *"Everything I'd already written above is saved"*, is unreachable from here by
//! construction.
