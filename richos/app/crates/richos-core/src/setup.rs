//! FIRST-RUN SETUP — the two things a customer's Mac does not have, fetched and verified.
//!
//! # The gap this closes, stated as it was found
//!
//! **Today RichOS runs on the CEO's Mac and would not run on anyone else's.** `ceo-decisions.md`
//! §19 names the five manual steps a customer faces, and two of them are executables:
//!
//! > *What the customer must already have: Claude Code, an Anthropic account, a completed
//! > Claude login (there is no login flow inside RichOS), **the engine directory**, and
//! > whisper for voice — five manual steps.*
//!
//! The engine is the harder half and it is the launch blocker: it *"ships in no payload and
//! has no route onto another machine at all"*. `src-tauri/src/engine.rs` resolves seven
//! candidates for it and says so in its own header — *"It does not put an engine directory on
//! anybody else's computer… Candidates 3 and 7 are the two slots a future payload decision
//! could fill"*. **This module fills slot 7.**
//!
//! # The CEO's instruction, and what it is applied to
//!
//! > **"automatically download and install whatever the user needs"**
//!
//! Applied to Claude Code he named it himself and calls it **Option D** — *"detect at install
//! or first run whether Claude Code is present, and download and install it if not"*
//! (`open-items.md` row 3.14; `ceo-decisions.md` §19 records it as *"NOT superseded and not
//! dead"*). Licensing is **CLOSED and PERMITTED**, under four conditions, all of which this
//! module meets by construction:
//!
//! | Condition | How it is met here |
//! |---|---|
//! | the binary unmodified and installed as published | [`install_claude_code`] downloads **Anthropic's own installer** from `https://claude.ai/install.sh` and runs it. RichOS never writes a byte of their binary, never re-signs it, never nests it. §19 finding 2: re-signing it destroys it while `--version` still answers. |
//! | no authentication method removed or restricted | nothing here touches auth. RichOS is **BYO-Anthropic** — the customer still needs an account and a login, and the consent copy says so. |
//! | no paying for / reselling / intermediating usage | no key, no proxy, no token. [`verify_claude_signature`] resolves a path and reads a signature; that is the whole of RichOS's relationship with the binary. |
//! | plain-text naming only | the strings here name "Claude Code" in plain text and carry no mark. |
//!
//! # WHERE THE ENGINE COMES FROM — the choice, and why it needed no new ruling
//!
//! **Fetched from the public repository's Releases, as a deterministic tarball whose SHA-256
//! is compiled into this binary.** Not bundled. Four measured reasons, none of them a new
//! decision:
//!
//! 1. **§19 lists the engine directory under "What is NOT bundled"** and rules the payload at
//!    four files and 8,754,980 B, on a measurement of exactly that payload. The engine is
//!    5.8 MB on disk. Putting it in `Contents/Resources/engine` would contradict a ruling made
//!    the same day on the number it would change.
//! 2. **He ruled where the download lives the same day**: *"Where the download lives: THE
//!    PUBLIC GITHUB REPO'S RELEASES."* The engine is already **in that repository** —
//!    `<repo>/engine`, `VERSION` 1.0.0 — so a release asset needs no new host, no new
//!    mechanism, and no new decision. It is the intersection of two rulings, not an invention.
//! 3. **The engine moves on its own cadence.** Hooks, skills and agent definitions change
//!    without the Rust changing. A fetched engine updates without a new signed, notarized
//!    `.app`; a bundled one would make every hook edit a release.
//! 4. **It is verifiable, and a bundled one would be verified by the same act anyway.** The
//!    app's Developer ID signature covers the pinned digest below, so a fetched engine's
//!    integrity rests on the same signature a bundled one would have rested on.
//!
//! **The cost, stated rather than left to be discovered:** the pin is per-release. A build
//! whose pin is unset **refuses to install an engine** ([`SetupError::EngineUnpinned`]) rather
//! than trusting whatever a URL returns. There is no "if nobody said, fetch latest" anywhere
//! below — the same posture `provision.rs` takes with an unset corpus target, and for the same
//! reason: *exit 0 while doing the wrong thing is the failure mode we keep paying for.*
//!
//! # WHAT CAN BE PINNED AND WHAT CANNOT — measured, both directions
//!
//! **Claude Code: pinned by designated requirement, offline.** Measured on
//! `~/.local/share/claude/versions/2.1.257` on 2026-09-01:
//!
//! ```text
//! Identifier=com.anthropic.claude-code
//! Authority=Developer ID Application: Anthropic PBC (Q6L2SF6YDW)
//! TeamIdentifier=Q6L2SF6YDW
//! Sealed Resources=none
//! ```
//!
//! `codesign --verify --strict -R '<designated requirement>'` returns 0 against it with no
//! network. That is [`CLAUDE_DESIGNATED_REQUIREMENT`].
//!
//! **What CANNOT be pinned, said plainly: a stapled notarization ticket.** `Sealed
//! Resources=none` — it is a loose Mach-O, not a bundle, and a loose executable has nowhere to
//! carry a ticket. Measured, both directions, on this machine:
//!
//! ```text
//! xcrun stapler validate ~/.local/share/claude/versions/2.1.257
//!   -> "Stapler is incapable of working with Document files."   exit 66
//! xcrun stapler validate ~/.local/bin/claude          # the SYMLINK
//!   -> "Stapler is incapable of working with Alias files."      exit 0    <-- A FALSE PASS
//! ```
//!
//! **The symlink case exits 0 while validating nothing.** So stapling is not merely
//! unavailable here, it is a trap: a naive `stapler validate` in a setup script would report
//! success on the path RichOS actually resolves. Nothing in this module calls `stapler`.
//! Signature verification is [`verify_claude_signature`], and it resolves the symlink first so
//! the verdict names the file it actually checked.
//!
//! **The engine tarball cannot be pinned by signature either** — it is not code Apple signs.
//! It is pinned by **SHA-256, compiled into this binary**, which the app's own Developer ID
//! signature then covers. Digest is checked **before** extraction, so a tampered archive never
//! reaches `tar`.
//!
//! # NEVER A HALF-INSTALLED STATE THAT REPORTS SUCCESS
//!
//! [`install_engine`] stages into `<dest>.incoming.<pid>.<nanos>`, verifies the digest, then
//! the extracted **shape**, and only then swaps by `rename`. Every early return removes the
//! staging directory, and [`Staging`] removes it on unwind too, so a panic cannot leave
//! residue that the next boot would resolve as an engine. The swap itself is two renames on
//! one filesystem with the old copy kept until the new one is in place.

// [`engine_accepted`] above compares `VERSION` strings, and until 2026-09-18 that was the whole

//
// EVERY NIGHTLY PUBLISHES ITS OWN `richos-engine-1.2.0.tar.gz`. The version inside it is
// `1.2.0` for all of them, because `1.2.0` is the engine's RELEASE and a nightly is not a new
// release of the engine — it is a new CUT of it. So two engines a day apart answer the
// identical question identically:
//
//   - installed under the walk's HOME, from `v1.2.0-nightly.20260917.2` (its own
//     `INSTALLED-FROM`): sha256 `b7a882ef4381ca294259c1a01a6af29acc3159dc0b871e8064bd7f410b71da07`,
//     119,463,136 B;
//   - pinned by candidate .8's binary (`strings` on `Contents/MacOS/richos-tauri`): sha256
//     `ea7f79043e7dc8f51b5f4207964ec5fa3e15ca11b44e5342a5fb4d38580db194`, from
//     `v1.2.0-nightly.20260918.2`. That binary contains the pinned digest once and the
//     installed digest ZERO times;
//   - `VERSION` in both: `1.2.0`, so `engine_accepted` returned `Ok(())` and the app booted
//     the older directory.
//
// The consequence, on Ray's walk of candidate .8: the first background job failed 6.28 s after
// registration with *"the selected engine cannot hold a separate seat for background work"*
// (`ecs.rs:328-333`). The installed `ecs/adapters/app.py` contains **no occurrence of the
// substring `seat`, in any case, anywhere beneath `ecs/`** — the seat work landed on main on
// 2026-09-17 and the app was running the cut from the night before. `supports_work_seats`
// (`ecs.rs:295`) is a POSITIVE probe and answered correctly; the fault was never in the probe.
// A user who updates from one 1.2.0 nightly to the next otherwise keeps yesterday's engine
// forever.
//
// BOTH HALVES OF THE COMPARISON WERE ALREADY ON THE MACHINE, and that is the part worth saying
// plainly. [`install_engine`] has written the installed digest into `INSTALLED-FROM` since it
// was first written, and [`engine_pin`] has carried the pinned digest compiled in. Nothing ever
// read the first one. What follows is a COMPARISON, not a new mechanism.
//
// WHY THE RULE IS THREE-VALUED AND NOT A BOOLEAN. A digest can only judge a directory whose
// provenance RichOS knows, and RichOS installs exactly one ([`engine_install_dir`]). A
// developer's checkout carries no stamp and is not stale — it is not an installation at all.
// Collapsing those two would make every `cargo run` in this repository unresolvable, which is a
// worse defect than the one being fixed, so the three cases are NAMED ([`EngineIdentity`])
// rather than merged.

/// The `INSTALLED-FROM` stamp, parsed.
///
/// Every field is optional because a stamp written by an older build, or truncated by a full
/// disk, is one we can still read PART of — and the part that decides (`sha256`) is then either

/// - `Required` — this build NAMES an asset, so it boots the directory installed from that
///   asset and nothing else. A stamp is required; **no stamp means the contents are unknown, and
///   unknown is refreshed rather than trusted.**
///
/// # WHY A MISSING STAMP IS NOT FORGIVEN, EVEN OUTSIDE THE DIRECTORY RICHOS INSTALLS
