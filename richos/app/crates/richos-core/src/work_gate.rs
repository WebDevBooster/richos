//! IS RICHOS DOING ANYTHING RIGHT NOW — the one question the updater never asked.
//!
//! # What this exists to stop
//!
//! Verified in the shipped source on 2026-09-05, and it was three missing checks rather
//! than one. `updates.rs`'s `install()` took the pending update and began downloading with
//! no test of turn state; `ui/updates.js` wired the Install button straight to the command,
//! so nothing was disabled and nothing warned; and `update_relaunch()` was `app.restart()`
//! and nothing else — two lines, no condition. **Pressed mid-turn, the third one replaces
//! the process while a `claude` child is mid-answer.**
//!
//! The CEO's decision, in his words: *"Yes, offer to wait and install when all work is
//! finished."* **ALL WORK**, not the current turn — RichOS runs workers alongside the
//! conversation, and a worker still running is still work. And the sentence that ranks it
//! against everything else: *"The update is not important enough to get in the way of
//! finishing work."*
//!
//! # Why the decision is HERE and the reading is in the shell
//!
//! This module holds no handles, opens no files and calls no syscalls. It takes three
//! already-measured [`Liveness`] readings and returns [`WorkVerdict`]. That split is not
//! tidiness: `app/src-tauri` carries the whole webview dependency tree and is deliberately
//! detached from the workspace, so a decision that lived there would be a decision the
//! 927-test spine suite could not reach. Every rule below is unit-tested against a table of
//! constructed readings, including the ones a real machine produces about twice a year.
//!
//! # THE THREE SOURCES, AND WHY EACH IS THE ONE IT IS
//!
//! **1. The active turn.** `TurnControl::active_turn()` — a MIRROR of the spine's
//! `turn_in_progress`, written at `spine.rs:1475` beside `mark_turn_started` and cleared at
//! `spine.rs:1609` beside the terminal event. It is readable WITHOUT the spine's mutex,
//! which is the only reason this is possible at all: `send_message` holds that mutex for the
//! entire length of a turn (`main.rs:448`), so a gate that locked the spine to ask whether a
//! turn was running would get its answer after the turn it meant to protect had ended. It is
//! never inferred from silence or from activity (continuity §5.2).
//!
//! **2. Whether the spine is being driven at all.** The mirror above has a REAL GAP and it
//! was found by reading the drain path rather than by guessing: `submit_prompt`
//! (`spine.rs:1181`) runs `deliver` → `after_turn_boundary` → `drain_queue` inside ONE call,
//! and `end_turn` fires at `spine.rs:1609` — before the closing runs, the last worker
//! re-join, the terminal status emit, `settle_stop_claim` and `drain_intake`, and well
//! before the NEXT queued turn's `begin_turn`. Between two queued turns `active_turn()` is
//! genuinely `None` while work is genuinely continuing, and every one of those steps does
//! file I/O, so the window is milliseconds of wall clock rather than nanoseconds. A poller
//! CAN land in it. The shell closes that window without touching the spine at all: it
//! `try_lock`s the spine mutex, and a lock it cannot take means someone is inside a spine
//! call — which is [`Liveness::Unknown`], never [`Liveness::Clear`]. Conservative by
//! construction: a 200µs `threads()` call costs one extra poll of waiting, and waiting is
//! never the defect.
//!
//! **4. BACKGROUND WORK — the second lease, and the hole this module had until 2026-09-17.**
//! The background-work spec §6.4 names it and refuses to call it a follow-up: *"its worker
//! reading is scoped to the conversation lease … a second lease's session is not that one, so
//! background workers would be INVISIBLE to the update gate, and an update could install over
//! live work — precisely the destroyed-work failure that gate exists to prevent. The update
//! gate must read both leases."* [`background`] is that reading, and it is deliberately wider
//! than the spec's sentence: the work lease's own worker view is one half, and the ASSIGNMENT
//! REGISTER is the other, because an assignment between its registration and its first worker
//! has no workers to see and is still work this app must not be replaced in the middle of.
//!
//! **And it distinguishes two things the spec insists are different sentences** (§6.5): work
//! that is RUNNING, and work that is WAITING FOR HIM. *"'An assignment is running' and 'an
//! assignment is waiting for you' are different sentences, and only one of them is about
//! him."* Both block; they say different things, and the second one names something he can
//! act on in this same app.
//!
//! **3. Workers.** [`crate::worker_status::WorkerStatusView`], whose own arithmetic is
//! liveness-reconciled open runs — a `created`/`started` with no later `run_ended` whose
//! recorded `host_pid` is witnessed alive by a real syscall. [`workers`] below maps that
//! view onto a reading and, crucially, decides which of its refusals are an honest zero and
//! which are an honest "I cannot tell".
//!
//! # FAIL TOWARD WAITING — the rule, and the one place it is deliberately not applied
//!
//! **Ambiguity resolves to waiting, never to installing.** Same shape as the voice gate
//! landed the same day: a dropped turn is a nuisance, a fabricated one is the defect. Here,
//! a delayed update is a nuisance and destroyed work is the defect. So [`Liveness::Unknown`]
//! blocks exactly as [`Liveness::Busy`] does — the two differ only in what the CEO is told.
//!
//! **The exception is named rather than hidden, because an unnamed exception is the failure
//! this whole module is about.** [`Unattributed::NoSession`] means no compute lease is
//! attached. Workers are spawned by the Claude session the app's lease is serving, and their
//! directory is `~/.claude/teams/session-<first8 of that id>`, so with no lease there is no
//! id, no directory, and nothing this app dispatched. It is read as CLEAR **and reported in
//! [`WorkVerdict::unchecked`]**, so the surface says workers were not checked rather than
//! implying they were. Reading it as Unknown instead would mean an app whose `claude` child
//! failed to start — which refuses every message and is exactly the state a customer most
//! needs to update out of — could never update again. That is the "a test that passes
//! because everything now defers" failure, and it is a worse trap than the one being fixed.
//!
//! # WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT CLAIM
//!
//! It does not see anything outside this process and this session: a worker belonging to
//! another session, a build running in a terminal, a file the CEO is copying. It has never
//! claimed to. Everything it could not establish is named in `unchecked` and rendered in
//! words, because *"never claim to have waited for something you did not check"* is a
//! requirement of the ruling and not a nicety.
