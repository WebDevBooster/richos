//! **yt-dlp on the user's Mac, kept at the newest `nightly` release** (media-tools plan, slice 2:
//! richos-hq `docs/plans/2026-10-07-media-tools.md` §1 and §3).
//!
//! The CEO, 2026-10-07: *"yt-dlp needs frequent updating in order to work with Youtube. So,
//! either the video skill or better our RichOS app needs to make sure the most up-to-date version
//! of that tool is always available on the user's machine."* The app stays lean: nothing here is
//! inside the `.app`. The app downloads yt-dlp into `~/Library/Application Support/RichOS/tools/`
//! and keeps it current.
//!
//! **Why not the engine runtime.** The runtime is a fixed, hashed inventory and `runtime.rs`
//! refuses any file it does not list; "newest" means these bytes change whenever yt-dlp
//! publishes. So the tools folder is its own home, and [`crate::runtime::EngineRuntime::path`]
//! puts it on Rich's PATH (after `/sbin`, see below).
//!
//! **What is installed.** The platform-independent `yt-dlp` file (a Python zipapp, about 3 MB;
//! it runs on the delivered Python), stored under its own hash, plus a one-line `yt-dlp.conf`
//! (`--js-runtimes node`, so YouTube's challenges run on the delivered Node). yt-dlp reads that
//! file as its portable config because it sits in the same folder as the zipapp (measured: `-v`
//! printed `Portable config ".../tools/yt-dlp.conf": ['--js-runtimes', 'node']` and
//! `JS runtimes: node-24.21.0` through the launcher below).
//!
//! **Fetch and integrity**, reusing `setup.rs`: [`Fetcher`] (`CurlFetcher` in the app, https
//! only), [`sha256_file`] and the staging folder that cannot outlive a failure. The hash comes
//! from the same release's `SHA2-256SUMS`. That is **single-witness**: it catches corruption and
//! a half-finished download, not a compromised host (the same honest weakness `provision.rs`
//! names for one model). A file that does not match is deleted and not retried in that check.
//!
//! **Frank's three findings on this code** (richos-hq `docs/plans/2026-10-07-media-tools-review.md`):
//!
//! - **m1, a refresh while yt-dlp runs.** yt-dlp imports extractors lazily from its own zip, so
//!   replacing the zip under a running copy can crash that run. Each version is stored as
//!   `tools/yt-dlp-<first 12 hex of its sha256>` and never rewritten; `tools/yt-dlp` is a small
//!   `/bin/sh` launcher that `exec`s `python3` on the current version, and only the launcher is
//!   swapped (one `rename`). A superseded version is deleted at the FOLLOWING refresh, not at the
//!   swap, so a run that started on it keeps its file. A symlink would not do: Python reopens the
//!   path it was given.
//! - **m2, an unverified folder ahead of `/usr/bin`.** The tools folder is user-writable and not
//!   hash-checked at load, so it goes on PATH after `/sbin`: nothing put there can shadow a
//!   system command. `yt-dlp` has no system namesake, so the order costs it nothing.
//! - **m3, no yt-dlp for 6 hours.** The release tag is resolved ONCE per check (from the
//!   `releases/latest` redirect) and both files come from `releases/download/<tag>/`, so a nightly
//!   published between the two requests cannot produce a mismatch. While no copy is installed,
//!   [`next_check`] retries every [`RETRY_WHILE_MISSING`] instead of every [`REFRESH_EVERY`].
//!
//! **Offline or any other failure changes nothing**: the installed copy and its launcher stay as
//! they were.
