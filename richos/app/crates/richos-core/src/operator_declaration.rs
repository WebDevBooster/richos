//! THE OPERATOR DECLARATION — the one file that switches his own team on behind the app,
//! on his Mac and nowhere else (operator back-end spec r2, richos-hq
//! `docs/plans/2026-09-24-operator-back-end-spec-r2.md` (f); CEO ruling §86).
//!
//! **Three states, and only the first is the product.**
//!
//! | `<app data>/operator.json` | What runs |
//! |---|---|
//! | absent | the product back end, exactly as today ([`Gate::Product`]) |
//! | present and valid | his team, from his engine ([`Gate::Operator`]) |
//! | present and invalid | **no background work at all** ([`Gate::Refused`]) |
//!
//! The third row is Frank's B8 and it is the reason this file exists as a gate rather than a
//! config reader with a default. On his Mac the product back end would land into his real
//! repositories as `RichOS <richos@localhost>` with the generic worker, so a broken file is
//! never read as "no file". A broken file refuses work until it is fixed or removed, and the
//! refusal names what is wrong in one sentence.
//!
//! **Only absence is the product path**, and absence means the path does not exist at all
//! (`ENOENT`). A file that exists and cannot be read, a directory, a link, an empty file:
//! each is present, so each refuses.
//!
//! **The land fences are part of "valid"** (spec r3 §11 item 2, e8). A declaration is valid
//! only while `OPERATOR_FENCES="on"` stands in his `orchestration.config` AND
//! `<declared engine>/scripts/operator-fences.sh status` exits 0. The engine does not ship that
//! script yet (zach, r3 §6), so today every declaration refuses at this step, which is the
//! intended order: no operator lead opens without the fences.
//!
//! ## What the file holds (schema 1)
//!
//! Written only by the private `enable.sh` (spec §6, zach), read only here. Every path is
//! absolute and is used as written, whatever this app's own `HOME` is: a nightly runs with a
//! scratch `HOME` (`richos/app/NIGHTLY.md`), and his team must run with his.
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "schema": 1,
//!   "entity_root": "/Users/<him>/ab/femcboost",
//!   "engine_root": "/Users/<him>/ab/richos/richos/engine",
//!   "home": "/Users/<him>",
//!   "claim": {"file": "/Users/<him>/.claude/state/operator-lead.json",
//!             "lock": "/Users/<him>/.claude/state/operator-lead.lock"},
//!   "permission_mode": "bypassPermissions",
//!   "environment": {"PATH": "…", "LANG": "…", "USER": "…"},
//!   "origins": ["desk-typed", "desk-voice", "desk-file"],
//!   "file_roots": ["/Users/<him>/ab"],
//!   "contract": {"path": "/…/operator-contract.md", "sha256": "<64 hex>"}
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Unknown fields are refused. A gate that skipped a field it did not know would let a typo
//! in a safety field read as that field being absent.
//!
//! ## The environment rule, (i)
//!
//! `environment` holds the names `enable.sh` captured from his terminal, with their values.
//! It never holds a credential: any `ANTHROPIC_*` or `CLAUDE*` name, or any name containing
//! `TOKEN`, `KEY`, `SECRET` or `PASSWORD`, refuses the whole file ([`is_denied_name`]). That
//! covers `CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_TOKEN`, which his terminal carries (spec §2). It also never
//! holds `HOME`, `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` or `TMPDIR`, which are re-derived at every lead start
//! ([`REDERIVED_NAMES`]), nor a `RICHOS_*` name, which only the app sets. This is the license
//! condition in `native.rs`'s module doc: RichOS never collects, stores or passes a Claude
//! credential. `enable.sh` refuses to write such a file; this refuses to read one, so a
//! hand-edited file cannot slip one through.
