//! The durable ASSIGNMENT register — what he asked for, written down before anything runs.
//!
//! The background-work spec (richos-hq `docs/plans/background-work-spec-2026-09-17.md`
//! revision 5, `9255e71a`) §1: *"An assignment turn ends when the work is registered —
//! intent recorded, receipt written — not when it settles."* This module is the receipt,
//! and nothing in it starts, prepares or waits for anything. `register` writes one file
//! and returns; §7.1's decided boundary — *"registration is the receipt, and `prepare`
//! runs on the work lease after the turn has ended"* — is only true if this path is free
//! of every second that step costs (a measured 3.0–3.8 s of guards and workspace creation
//! per assignment, spec §7.1).
//!
//! **The register is not the receipt store, and the difference is the point.** Mega
//! Lander's own work receipts (`work_status.rs`) are written by the engine and describe
//! what a worker did. This register is written by the app and describes what the CEO
//! ASKED FOR — it exists from the moment he speaks, before a workspace exists, so a crash
//! in the gap leaves a record of the request rather than a gap (spec §0 row 1). The two
//! are partitioned identically (`sha256(json([entity, thread]))`) so one thread's saved
//! work and one thread's assignments can never be read across a company boundary.
//!
//! **Two things are deliberately NOT here.** Recovery (spec row 9 / §6) is the next slice:
//! nothing in this file reconciles a state after a crash, and `Running` on disk after a
//! restart means *"it was running when we last looked"* — spec §6.2's receipt state, not a
//! status. And the window-closed process model (row 5 / §2.4) is the next slice too, so
//! `open()` exists for the update gate and the settle check and is not yet wired to an
//! exit decision.

// **Where Ray's row 8 double period went, and why there is no helper here for it.**
//
// He saw *"… and land it.. It's running now"*: the model's title ended in a period and the
// receipt put its own straight after it. Two things removed that, and between them nothing in
// this module now writes a period directly after a title:
//
//   1. [`sanitize_title`] strips a trailing period at the source. That is the production fix,
//      and it is the one that matters for the seven sentences in [`says`] — a title of *"land
//      it."* used to make every one of them read *"land it. is finished."*
//   2. The CEO's ruling §55 took the title out of the receipt altogether, which was the only
//      sentence in the module that appended punctuation to one.
//
// A first pass here added an `after_title` helper for the case `sanitize_title` deliberately
// leaves — a truncated title keeps the ellipsis it needs. It was dropped at `25b933f2` on the
// reasoning that *"every sentence in [`says`] continues with a word rather than a mark, so an
// ellipsis is followed by a space and reads correctly"*.
//
// **THAT REASONING WAS WRONG, AND RAY'S CANDIDATE-.8 ROW 8 IS IT BEING WRONG ON HIS SCREEN**
// (`docs/verification/2026-09-18-nightly-1.2.0-20260918.2-onscreen-audit.md` §1 row 8), verbatim:
//
//   "…and land it. (Third try; the first two stopped before they… stopped before it finished."
//
// An ellipsis is TERMINAL punctuation. A lowercase verb phrase running straight on from one does
// not read as a continuation; it reads as a sentence that broke off and restarted — and it reads
// that way aloud, which is the half that matters on a voice-first surface. The join is back, as
// [`says::continues`], for the case the old one was written for and now against the evidence that
// the case is real rather than hypothetical. It is still ONE funnel and not seven, for the same
// reason [`sanitize_title`] strips the period once. The property is asserted over every sentence
// in [`says`], which is what catches the eighth one somebody adds.

/// Spec §1.4: *"A failed registration is never softened into 'I have started it'."*
