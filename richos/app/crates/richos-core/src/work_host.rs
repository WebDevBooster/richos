//! The WORK HOST — the actor that is not the conversation, and the second compute lease
//! it owns.
//!
//! The background-work spec (richos-hq `docs/plans/background-work-spec-2026-09-17.md`
//! revision 5, `9255e71a`) §2.1: *"a second compute lease inside the app process, owned by
//! a work host that is not the spine."* §2.2 says why there is no cheaper answer: the
//! conversation's lease is held for the entire turn (`src-tauri/src/main.rs:561`, still
//! held at `:582`), and today's workers are helpers INSIDE that turn
//! (`native.rs`'s `nested_worker_text_and_results_never_become_the_leads_conversation`).
//! Work leaves the turn only by leaving that lease.
//!
//! **Three structural rules, each of which is a test in this file.**
//!
//! 1. **The host never takes the spine's lock.** It cannot: it has no reference to the
//!    spine. Everything it needs — the state root, the thread binding, the assignment
//!    register — is passed in or read from disk. That is why §0 row 2's *"answers within
//!    seconds"* survives a background assignment that runs for an hour.
//! 2. **The work lease is never attached to the conversation's `TurnControl`** (spec §4.2).
//!    `TurnControl`'s cancel slot is a single `Option<Arc<dyn TurnCancel>>` that
//!    `set_cancel` overwrites (`steering.rs:753-761`), so attaching the work lease would
//!    make Stop kill the work and leave the conversation running — the exact inverse of
//!    what the CEO decided. The host keeps its own handle and reaches it by name.
//! 3. **Nothing infers a finish.** A work turn ending is not a settlement
//!    (`docs/architecture/desktop-work.md:29`). The host settles an assignment only on the
//!    same evidence the conversation's turn-end check uses, read against the WORK lease's
//!    session id (spec §2.9) — and anything it cannot witness counts as still running.
//!
//! **THE CEO's §51 SHAPE, AND WHERE THIS FILE DEPARTS FROM THE SPEC BECAUSE OF IT.**
//! `richos-hq/wiki/ceo-decisions.md` §51 (2026-09-17): *"the job of the front desk Rich is
//! solely talking to the CEO and relaying info to and from the back-end Rich."* One front
//! desk — the conversation lease — and **one standing, invisible back-end Rich** that starts
//! and stops jobs, dispatches, lands and keeps the record. The ruling names the consequence
//! for this file in its own words: *"the work host runs ONE standing back-end lease instead
//! of one per job"*, which overrules the spec's per-assignment lease wherever the two
//! disagree.
//!
//! So [`WorkHost::ensure_lease`] opens the back end once and every assignment afterwards runs
//! on that same lease — pinned by `the_back_end_is_one_standing_lease_across_every_assignment`
//! rather than left to a return-early nobody would notice changing. What stays per assignment
//! is what §51 keeps per assignment: an assignment is *"a bookkeeping unit inside the back
//! end (its own record, seat, stop, approval line) — not a separate mind"*, so the seat, the
//! standing grant and the permission queue's hold are still one each, created and released
//! with the assignment.
//!
//! **4. The back end renews itself, and only ever between assignments.** Sage's finding 11
//!    on the CEO's page: a STANDING back end per thread is a provider session that
//!    accumulates context for as long as the thread lives — *"forever"* is his own word for
//!    what a thread does — and the annex never had this problem, because its work lease was
//!    short-lived. [`WorkHost::rotate_if_needed`] is the seam, at the one moment
//!    continuity §3.1 allows: a completed assignment, with nothing live. The successor is
//!    primed from the durable register rather than from a transcript, which is what makes
//!    the renewal crash-safe and cheap.
//!
//! **Where rows 5 and 9 live.** This file holds their two seams — [`WorkHost::settlement`]
//! and [`WorkHost::open_assignments`] — plus the three things the process model needs from
//! a host: [`WorkNotifier::nothing_left_to_do`] (§2.4a's trigger, decided by the shell
//! because only the shell knows whether a window is open), [`WorkHost::remember_binding`]
//! (so his approval can resume an assignment after a relaunch) and the start-of-assignment
//! pin that recovery reconciles against ([`crate::assignment::note_start`]). The
//! reconciliation itself is [`crate::recovery`]; the exit arms are `src-tauri/src/main.rs`.

        // ends seconds later with the worker just getting started.
        //
        // **`DESKTOP.md` step 4 told the back end to wait for it with `TaskOutput`, and
        // `TaskOutput` IS NOT IN THIS LEASE'S TOOL INVENTORY.** Read off the child's own
        // `system/init` frame on 2026-09-18: 30 tools, including `Task`, `TaskStop`,
        // `Monitor`, `ListAgents` and `SendMessage`, and no `TaskOutput` and no `BashOutput`.
        // The one instruction standing between "launched" and "landed" has always named a
        // tool that is not there — which is why it was never called in any run measured, with
        // the lease's tools deferred and again with them resident, and with the wait spelled
        // out in the assignment brief itself.
        //
        // **So the waiting is the HOST's, where it cannot be forgotten, and it is done on a
        // positive signal.** `app_workers::status` counts a run open until a `SubagentStop`
        // for that `agent_id` is in the journal; this loop waits for that row, never for a
        // timer to expire and never for the filesystem to go quiet. When it arrives the lease
        // is given one more turn, on the same seat and the same open grant, saying the helper
        // has ended and to carry on. A CEO Stop and a quit both end the wait at once.
        //
        // Reaching the bound claims nothing either way: the row says the helper is taking
        // longer than usual and the wait goes on (hunt part 1 finding 06). Only when the wait
        // ends for another reason (his Stop, a quit, the lease or the evidence gone) do the
        // readings below report what they can witness.

        // later. The provider then reports the ending in a turn of its own, with no prompt of
        // ours parked, so its words go to `native.rs`'s between-turn lane (`route`, the
        // `None` arm), which this host never reads; and this assignment had already settled on
        // "it has started". That was the whole of the finish he never heard (test VM,
