//! Session-continuity FOUNDATION — the re-prime payload (P1.4, foundation only).
//!
//! The durable Rich is the APP; a Claude session is a swappable compute lease
//! (continuity design §1.1). When a lease is (re)spawned, the app injects a re-prime
//! payload as an INTERNAL, NON-RENDERED priming turn so the successor resumes as the
//! SAME Rich, mid-conversation — no re-ask, no amnesia, no false attribution.
//!
//! This module builds the payload and renders it to the priming-turn text. Full
//! turn-boundary rotation on a context watermark + self-authored handoff summaries
//! are a LATER leg; the seam is here (Spine::reprime_current_session) so they drop in.
