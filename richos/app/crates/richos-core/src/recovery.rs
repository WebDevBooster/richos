//! **WHAT A RELAUNCH MAY SAY ABOUT WORK IT DID NOT SEE END** — row 9, and every rule in
//! this file is a refusal.
//!
//! The CEO's nine, row 9: *"If the app crashes or restarts mid-run, nothing invents a
//! completion."* The background-work spec (richos-hq
//! `docs/plans/background-work-spec-2026-09-17.md` revision 5) §6 is the mechanism:
//!
//! - **§6.1** — *"receipts are reconciled against Git and the evidence file, never against
//!   a timestamp. Interrupted execution is never converted into verified completion."*
//! - **§6.2** — *"work that was running is reported as unknown until re-witnessed, and the
//!   CEO is told that plainly."*
//! - **§6.3** — *"Nothing restarts work by itself. Resuming is a decision, and the decision
//!   is his or Rich's — never a retry loop. This is the specific mechanism September 9 kept
//!   adding and is the reason it was removed."*
//! - **§6.3a** — orphan seats and orphan grants are reconciled here, and **his own seat is
//!   identified positively and never touched**, because *"everything that is not his"* is
//!   exactly the reasoning that would delete his cursor after a crash.
//!
//! **THE ONE THING THIS FILE NEVER DOES IS START ANYTHING.** It reads, it compares, it
//! writes an honest receipt, and it raises a sentence for him. `Unknown` is where every
//! path it can take ends up, and the only exit from `Unknown` is him
//! ([`crate::assignment::AssignmentState::awaits_his_word`]).
//!
//! **Why the two witnesses are the ones they are.**
//!
//! 1. **The evidence file**, keyed by the work lease's session (`app_workers.rs:38`), which
//!    this build now writes onto the assignment before it runs
//!    ([`crate::assignment::note_start`]). Its rules are unchanged and are the reason it is
//!    trusted: unattributed or unreadable evidence counts as still running, never as zero
//!    (`app_workers.rs:33-47`). **Workers all ending is still not a settlement** — the
//!    engine says so in its own voice (`richos/engine/mega-lander/app.py:664-669`) — so a
//!    quiet evidence file moves nothing toward finished here either.
//! 2. **Git**, compared against the pins taken when the assignment started. This is the
//!    assertion §7.8 asks to be made *"in Git, not on the screen"*. It is evidence in ONE
//!    direction: an unmoved branch is positive proof that nothing was landed; a moved one
//!    proves only that the repository changed, and never that this assignment is what
//!    changed it.
//!
//! **What is deliberately not here.** Nothing reads a clock. A `registered_at_ms` that is
//! three days old is not evidence of anything, and §6.1 rules out the comparison by name.

/// **Orphan seats (§6.3a), reconciled by the HOST — and the brief's premise for this did
/// not survive re-derivation, so here is what is actually true.**
///
/// The engine does have a `reconcile_seats` (`richos/engine/mega-lander/app.py:946`), and
/// **the app cannot reach it.** It runs inside the work adapter's `inspect` tool, and only
/// from an UNSEATED scope: `if offset == 0 and scope.get("seat") is None` (`app.py:1069-1072`).
/// Since the CEO's Two Riches page took `richos_work` away from the front desk, the only
/// lease that has that tool is the back end (`native.rs:997`), whose scope is seated the
/// moment it can use a work tool at all (`native.rs`'s `bind_work_assignment` writes
/// `seat: Some(…)`, and the adapter refuses every work tool without the grant that comes
/// with it, `app.py:41-42`). So the engine's reconciler is unreachable from this app as
/// built, and *"the app calls it at boot"* names a call that cannot be made.
///
/// **What the app has instead is the pair of host-only commands the engine exposes for
/// exactly this** — `seats` and `release-seat` (`ecs/adapters/app.py:39, 213, 225`), whose
/// own comment says enumerating and releasing seats *"is the HOST's reconciliation, never a
/// background lease's"*. This is that reconciliation.
///
/// **HIS OWN CURSOR IS NEVER TOUCHED, and it is excluded by construction rather than by
/// elimination.** A row is acted on only if it positively identifies itself as a work seat:
/// `audience == "worker"` **and** a `work-seat:` person id **and** the same company and
/// conversation this cursor is in. *"Everything that is not his"* is precisely the
/// reasoning that would delete his cursor after a crash (§6.3a), and it is not used here.
/// The engine refuses his seat by name as well (`adapters/app.py:226-230`), so this is the
/// second of two locks, not the only one.
///
/// **What it can see is bounded, and the bound is named rather than hidden.** `release-seat`
/// refuses a work seat from another conversation (`adapters/app.py:238-241`), so this
/// reconciles the conversation the app's cursor is currently in. A seat left on another
/// thread is reconciled when that thread next takes a turn and this runs again.
