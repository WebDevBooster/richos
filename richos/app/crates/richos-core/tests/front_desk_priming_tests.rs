//! **The front desk is ready BEFORE he types** — the CEO's ruling §55, 2026-09-18, and the half
//! of it that is not about the reply.
//!
//! *"Yes, a few seconds is fine. But 35 seconds of waiting for the first response is not. Go."*
//!
//! # The measurement these tests are about
//!
//! `docs/verification/first-reply-2026-09-18.md` measured the lease's FIRST visible turn at
//! **13.464 s / 13.628 s / 15.513 s** and its warm turns at **7.128 s / 8.505 s / 8.920 s**, and
//! attributed the ~8 s difference to "the lease waking up while he waits". The code says what that
//! is, exactly: `Spine::prime_lease_if_needed` runs `Cognition::reprime` — a real model turn — and
//! it is called from `prepare_request`, which runs INSIDE `submit_prompt`. His first message pays
//! for the priming of the lease that is about to answer it.
//!
//! So the seconds are not a process start, they are a TURN, and the only thing that can be done
//! about them is to spend that turn before he is waiting on it. That is `prime_front_desk`, and
//! these are its invariants. Every one of them runs headless on `MockCognition` — no provider, no
//! network, no model turn. The real-provider numbers are
//! `examples/first_reply_timing_e2e.rs`'s job.
