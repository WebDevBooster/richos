//! TIER E, WIRED — the CEO's own files reaching a turn when memory has nothing, and the
//! three ways that must not happen.
//!
//! The gap these tests close: `evidence-lookup.js` landed on 2026-09-17 with an end-to-end
//! proof and no caller. The compiler's `coverage` label — the ruling's stated trigger — was
//! parsed by `loro.rs` into a field and then dropped on the floor by `interpret`, so nothing
//! in the app could tell "memory answered" from "memory has nothing" and the lookup could
//! never have been reached even if something had wanted to.
//!
//! Every test here runs against a FAKE compiler and a FAKE lookup holding invented content.
//! Not one byte of the CEO's corpus is in this repository and `richos` goes public. The real
//! pair is exercised against a real evidence zone under a temp `HOME` by
//! `tools/richos-service/test/evidence-lookup-e2e.mjs` and by this pass's own end-to-end
//! transcript in `docs/verification/`.
//!
//! **Every negative assertion here carries a positive control.** "the block did not appear"
//! passes for the wrong reason if the lookup was never capable of producing one.
