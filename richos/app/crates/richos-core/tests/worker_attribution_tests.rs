//! WHOSE AI workers is RichOS looking at?
//!
//! Until 2026-08-29 the answer was *"whichever `~/.claude/teams/session-*` directory was
//! touched most recently"*, and that answer did not stay in the UI: `reprime.rs` reads
//! `worker_status::current_status()` and renders it into the payload injected into every
//! fresh Claude session, under a header calling it live worker state. So a directory
//! chosen by a file timestamp became an assertion, to Rich, that another session's workers
//! were his — inside the one payload whose Tier A #1 identity assertion exists precisely to
//! make false attribution structurally impossible (continuity design §2.1/§6).
//!
//! It was not hypothetical. Four `session-*` directories were present on the development
//! machine when this was found, and the mtime-newest belonged to the session writing the
//! fix, not to any session RichOS was serving.
//!
//! These tests pin the replacement — *derive the directory from the session identity, and
//! report nothing when it cannot be derived* — and, above all, they pin its absence of a
//! fallback. `an_unmatched_session_reads_nothing_even_with_a_busy_decoy_dir_present` and
//! `no_lease_reads_nothing_even_with_a_busy_decoy_dir_present` both FAIL if an mtime pick
//! is ever restored as a "best effort" last resort, because in both the decoy is newest and
//! full of live workers. `the_source_carries_no_mtime_selection_primitive` fails if one is
//! written at all.
//!
//! Every fixture below puts MORE THAN ONE session directory on disk, because a single-dir
//! fixture cannot tell a derivation apart from a guess — with one candidate, both are right.
