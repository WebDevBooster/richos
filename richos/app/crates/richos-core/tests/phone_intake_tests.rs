//! **THE PHONE'S ROAD IN** — the intake record a channel writes, and the idle drain that
//! is the whole difference between a message landing and a message appearing to vanish.
//!
//! Phone-client plan (`richos-hq/docs/plans/richos-phone-client-2026-09-18.md`) §4.2,
//! findings (i), (ii) and (vii):
//!
//! > `drain_intake()` is called from exactly two places: `after_turn_boundary()` and
//! > `reconcile_intake()` at boot. **Nothing drains the intake log while the app sits
//! > idle.** … He is standing in the kitchen watching his phone. **`poll_intake()` is not a
//! > half-day nicety any more; it is the feature.**
//!
//! # Every test here has a positive control
//!
//! A negative test that passes for the wrong reason is worse than no test. So each "it does
//! not happen" below is paired with the same setup in which it DOES happen, and the pair is
//! asserted in one test rather than in two that can drift apart. The one that matters most
//! is [`the_idle_drain_is_the_only_thing_that_makes_an_idle_message_land`]: without
//! `poll_intake` the record sits in the log and the ledger is empty, and with it the turn
//! runs — same fixture, same record, one call apart.
//!
//! Headless throughout: no live Claude, no network, no Tauri, no socket.
