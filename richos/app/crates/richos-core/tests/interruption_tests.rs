//! **WHY A TURN ENDED — one class per test, and a positive control for the transient arm.**
//!
//! `docs/verification/2026-09-17-nightly-1.2.0-20260917.1-onscreen-audit.md` §D2. The
//! published nightly held `cognition protocol: "Not logged in · Please run /login"` in its
//! own ledger and told the CEO it had hit a snag, that his work was saved, and that pressing
//! a button would pick it back up. All three were false.
//!
//! Every reason string below is the REAL one: either a vendor constant read verbatim out of
//! the installed Claude Code bundle (`~/.local/share/claude/versions/2.1.274`, 2026-09-17),
//! or a sentence RichOS itself writes, wrapped in the `CognitionError` `Display` that
//! `spine.rs` passes to the ledger.
//!
//! **There is no American-English test here and that is deliberate**: `guard-dialect.sh`
//! refuses the WRITE of a non-American word anywhere in this repository, which is a stronger
//! guarantee than a test that has to be remembered, and a test enumerating the words it
//! looks for would itself be refused by that guard.
