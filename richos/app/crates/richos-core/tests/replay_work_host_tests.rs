//! **THE WORK HOST OVER RECORDED REAL CLAUDE SESSIONS** (T3 idea 2; richos-hq
//! `docs/plans/2026-10-09-automatic-second-review-and-t3-ideas.md` §3 and §4 row 6).
//!
//! The real [`WorkHost`] runs the real [`NativeClient`], whose child is `richos-replay`
//! playing back a capture of a real `claude` session (`richos_core::replay`). Nothing between
//! the host and the provider's wire is hand-written: the frames are the provider's own, with
//! their recorded spacing, so the class of defect the six 2026-09/10 incidents shared — a
//! command or helper that ends after the back end's turn has ended, its finish reaching nobody
//! — is caught here in seconds instead of on a real run on his Mac or in the test VM.
//!
//! The only stand-ins are the ENGINE's (the seat binding, the obligation and the worker
//! evidence), the same three the work host's own unit tests stand in for; none of them is on
//! the provider's wire.
//!
//! The captures are `tests/fixtures/replay/`, scrubbed of the account that recorded them by
//! `scripts/replay/scrub-capture.py`. Headless: no live Claude, no network, no Tauri.
