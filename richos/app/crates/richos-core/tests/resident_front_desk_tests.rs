//! **N CONVERSATION THREADS, EACH HOLDING ITS OWN FRONT DESK** — the CEO's Two Riches page.
//!
//! *"a CEO can create a conversation thread (i.e. any number of conversation threads) …
//! each conversation thread always holds one front desk Rich and one back-end Rich …
//! the CEO could open and run multiple things in parallel."*
//!
//! What these suites measure is RESIDENCE: a thread's front desk — its provider session,
//! its priming, its own context measurements — survives another thread taking a turn,
//! instead of being killed and reconstituted from the ledger tail. Before this, a thread
//! switch called `clear_lease()` and the outgoing child died.
//!
//! **What they deliberately do NOT claim is simultaneity.** Two front desks do not hold a
//! turn open at the same instant, because both bind the CEO's single ECS cursor
//! (`native.rs`'s `CONVERSATION_SEAT`, whose doc carries the engine `file:line` for why).
//! Turns take turns; the WORK behind them has run in parallel since the work host took one
//! back end per thread. The test that pins that boundary lives beside the bind, in
//! `native.rs`, and is named for the day it changes.
