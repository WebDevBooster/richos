//! **A TURN THAT DIES TO THE MODEL API DOES NOT LOSE SILENTLY** — row 3.30's second and
//! third answers, driven through the REAL `Spine` against an INJECTED upstream.
//!
//! Nothing here touches a network. The fault is injected at the `Cognition` seam by two
//! doubles that reproduce the two shapes an upstream failure can take, and the failure
//! TEXT is the verbatim `529` line this machine captured on 2026-09-03 (committed at
//! `docs/verification/upstream-failure-2026-09-05/captured-529.txt`, request id
//! `req_011Cegb417YK6i1BEVDFmzU1`).
//!
//! **The second shape is the one that mattered most and would have been missed.** `claude`
//! reports an API failure as an ASSISTANT MESSAGE, so the turn ends with an ordinary
//! terminal and the vendor's diagnostic is persisted as Rich's own reply. A test that only
//! injected an `Err` would have proved nothing about it.
//!
//! **What this suite does NOT cover, named rather than left to be found.** Neither wire
//! shape is captured: the twelve runs in
//! `docs/verification/native-claude-stream-json-2026-08-31/raw/` contain no API error at
//! all. These doubles reproduce what the vendor's own code says it emits and what its own
//! transcripts on this machine contain; they are not a recording of the `claude`
//! stream-json wire under an outage, because no such recording exists.
