//! **THE DESK THAT IS PRIMED BEFORE THE THREAD IT WILL SERVE EXISTS** — the CEO's ruling §55,
//! 2026-09-18, and the half of it `first-words-2026-09-18-sendlock.md` §2.2 could not move.
//!
//! *"Yes, a few seconds is fine. But 35 seconds of waiting for the first response is not. Go."*
//!
//! # The measurement these tests are about
//!
//! Run F measured a contended brand-new thread at **9.647 s** from Send to his first words, of
//! which **2.368 s** was the remainder of a priming turn his message was queued behind. The
//! sendlock slice made the Send itself instant (4 ms) and durable; it did not and could not move
//! those seconds, because the priming is a model turn and the lease is serial (continuity §3.1).
//!
//! And the real path is worse than "a remainder". `ui/main.js:1688` creates the thread INSIDE the
//! Send handler, so the prime and the send are back-to-back: he pays the WHOLE priming turn. The
//! only thing that removes it is a desk that was primed before the thread existed.
//!
//! Every test here runs headless on `MockCognition` — no provider, no network, no model turn. The
//! real-provider numbers are `examples/first_reply_timing_e2e.rs`'s job and are recorded in
//! `docs/verification/first-words-2026-09-18-primed.md`.

// **The measurement these three tests exist for.** Ray's candidate-.12 re-walk put "On it!" on
// the real window at 14.24 s with the turn's own header reading "Working for 8s", so ~6 s went
// somewhere before the turn's clock started
// (`docs/verification/2026-09-19-nightly-1.2.0-nightly.20260919.1-mac-and-android-rewalk-audit.md`
// §2). The cause is in that walk's own committed log, in the ORDER of four lines: the spare
// primed for 5378 ms, and only AFTER it did `the front desk is ready before he types: 0 ms`
// appear — the timeline read that opens his new thread had been queued behind it.
// `create_thread_in` asks for the next spare microseconds before the window issues eight more
// bridge calls, and every one of them takes the same mutex the priming turn was holding.
//
// Re-measured on the real window on 2026-09-19 with per-hop instrumentation, on a debug build
// whose spare costs 18.3 s rather than 5.4 s:
//
//     [richos] a front desk is primed and waiting for the next new thread in sixsec-co: 18318 ms
//     [richos] a window command waited 18314 ms for the spine at src/main.rs:3964
//     [richos] a window command waited 18028 ms for the spine at src/main.rs:746
//     [richos] the front desk is ready before he types: 0 ms
//
// and the turn's own header first read "Working for 1s" at t = 19.61 s after the keystroke.
//
// These tests are the headless, deterministic form of that, and the first of them is the
// POSITIVE PROBE: it asserts the old road really does hold the mutex, so a green result from
// the second one is evidence rather than a test that cannot fail.
