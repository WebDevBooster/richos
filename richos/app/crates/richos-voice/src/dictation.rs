//! **Dictation in any app: every rule, with no device, no AppKit and no clock.**
//!
//! The dictation tool (`richos --richos-dictation`, `src-tauri/src/dictation/`) catches one key,
//! records, transcribes with the model the person chose and pastes at the cursor of whatever app
//! is in front. Every DECISION it makes lives here, so each one is proved by a unit test the way
//! `vad.rs` and `noaudio.rs` are: which key events are his key, the session's phases, the
//! too-short tap, the speech-evidence gate, the annotation rule, the no-audio-with-words rule,
//! the decode bound, which model runs, the spacing rule, the clipboard-restore rule and the
//! no-text-box rule. The tool's macOS edges are thin and decide nothing.
//!
//! Built to `richos-hq/docs/plans/2026-10-08-dictation-anywhere.md` (revision 2), section 2,
//! section 3 and section 5; the problem names match round 19's drawn bar lines
//! (`design/mockups/rounds/round-19/dictation.html`, `PROBLEMS`).
