//! The controller — the only stateful thing in the crate, and the only place threads live.
//!
//! Four threads, each with one job:
//!
//! | thread | job | must not |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | audio capture callback | VAD, barge-in monitor, utterance buffering | allocate much, block, or emit UI events |
//! | supervisor (40 Hz tick) | own the state machine, emit every UI event, dispatch work | do audio work |
//! | recognizer | whisper.cpp per finished utterance | block the mic |
//! | speaker | synthesize sentences and queue them for playout | block the turn |
//!
//! The capture callback owns its VAD/recorder/monitor outright — no locks — and talks to the
//! supervisor over a channel plus two atomics. That is deliberate: a `Mutex` on the audio
//! thread is how a voice pipeline starts clicking.
//!
//! ## The half-duplex TAINT rule — now conditional, and why
//!
//! While Rich is audible the microphone stays open (barge-in needs it), but any utterance that
//! BEGINS during his playout used to be marked **tainted** and discarded unless barge-in
//! actually fired during it. Without that rule, on speakers Rich hears himself, transcribes his
//! own sentence and answers it — the pilot's echo failure, one step worse.
//!
//! The rule's cost was stated plainly here: on speakers, the CEO could not start a new thought
//! while Rich was talking. He had to talk over him for the full 5.008 s debounce or tap "stop".
//! These docs said **"Real AEC deletes this rule. It is interim, and it is named as interim."**
//!
//! It is now deleted, conditionally and honestly. When [`crate::aec::EchoCanceller::confident`]
//! is true — the canceller has MEASURED its residual echo 6 dB below the VAD's speech floor and
//! held it there for 2.000 s — Rich's voice is no longer meaningfully present in the frames the
//! recorder buffers, so an utterance beginning while he speaks is not echo, it is the CEO
//! starting a sentence. It is kept.
//!
//! Whenever the canceller is NOT confident, the taint rule is exactly what it was. That is not
//! a hedge; it is the same fallback the barge-in debounce uses, driven by the same measurement.

    /// volume 85 a spoken turn produced the notice with nobody talking, and the identical turn

    /// **The code says the same thing, and it says it structurally.** `push_residual` sets
    /// `self.tainted = speaking && !self.barged && !confident`, so a tainted discard requires
    /// `confident == false` — the canceller declining to vouch for its own residual. When it IS
    /// confident the utterance is ADMITTED rather than discarded and there is nothing to

    /// CEO is conditional** — `if you said something just then` — because the app genuinely does
    /// not know, and `the_notice_makes_no_unconditional_claim_about_the_ceo` pins that.
    ///
    /// It still states the CONSEQUENCE, for the reason [`VoiceNotice::HeardNoVoice`] does: the
    /// failure this explains is the app sending the TAIL of his sentence as though it were the
    /// whole of it, and "I haven't sent anything" is the fact that makes Rich answering a
    /// fragment make sense. It still ends with a STATUS and not an instruction — "wait until I
    /// finish" would be an instruction to use the product more carefully to work around a
    /// limitation, which is not a thing to ask of him.
    ///
    /// **Latched once per voice session**, not per run — see [`RefusalNotices`]. What it
    /// describes is a standing property of the room and the hardware, not an event.
    ///
    /// **And since 2026-09-17 it spends the SAME budget as the three recognizer lines**, so
    /// it cannot be joined on screen by a second and third apology for the same silence.
    /// It is the strongest sentence in that family and therefore the one that stands.
    ///
    /// ## It KEEPS this trigger after the half-duplex window was widened — decided, with the number
    ///
    /// On 2026-09-17 the window stopped being the playout queue's depth and became the whole of
    /// Rich's answer, gaps and device tail included (`AudibleWindow`), and taint stopped being
    /// decided once at `Started`. That makes this line fire on strictly more discards, so the
    /// question was asked directly: is there anything left for it to say that is TRUE, or is
    /// every discard on this path now indistinguishable from echo, leaving the sentence saying
    /// nothing?
    ///
    /// **It is still true on every firing, and there is no honest narrower trigger.** Two
    /// different things produce a tainted discard here — Rich's own echo, and the CEO genuinely
    /// talking over Rich without meeting the 5.008 s debounce — and the line already refuses to
    /// choose between them: every clause about him is conditional. That is not a hedge, it is
    /// the measurement.
    ///
    /// The candidate narrower trigger was "fire only on a voiced residual standing above the
    /// echo the canceller expects". It does not survive contact with the numbers:
    ///
    /// - **Voicing cannot separate them.** Rich's echo IS voiced speech, so `voiced.rs`'s pitch
    ///   and harmonicity evidence answers yes to both. Only LEVEL is left.
    /// - **Level cannot either, on this path.** Measured over the CEO's own recording with no
    ///   near-end talker present, so every decibel of it is Rich
    ///   (`tests/self_voice_replay.rs::separating_the_ceo_from_richs_echo_by_level_needs_a_margin_this_large`,
    ///   447 far-active blocks): median residual **-48.6 dBFS**, p90 **-40.2**, p99 **-36.2**,

/// is said but *where it goes*. The defect is that the notice reaches the panel and not the

/// `handle` takes the SPEAK sink as a parameter and `controller::tests` asserts the sentence
/// arrived in both.
///
/// ## THE ORDER IS THE DESIGN, AND IT IS NOT INTERCHANGEABLE
///
/// 1. **Drop the dangling fragment.** The chunker holds whatever arrived after the last
///    sentence boundary — half a sentence that will never be completed, because the lease

///    nothing else. That is worse than silence, because trailing off is what a person does
///    while thinking.
/// 2. **Then say the notice**, appended AFTER whatever is already queued rather than
///    replacing it. The sentences Rich already completed are real answer and the CEO is
///    entitled to hear them finish; the generation counter is deliberately NOT bumped and
///    playout is deliberately NOT stopped. Silencing them in order to announce a cut-off
///    would destroy the thing being announced.
/// 3. **Then the reason, if the caller has one.** Voice cannot tell a `529` from a broken
///    pipe and does not try: `richos-core`'s `upstream.rs` classifies, and whatever sentence
///    it authored is spoken after this one. A `None` reason costs nothing — the notice

/// practice it is reachable by no test at all.
///
/// ## ONCE PER VOICE SESSION — changed from once-per-run, and the number is the reason
///
/// It used to clear whenever an utterance got through, on the theory that being heard proves
/// the run is over. That theory assumed the discards were EVENTS — the CEO interrupting now
/// and then. On his actual hardware they are not.
///
/// Measured on this Mac, 2026-09-17 (`docs/verification/2026-09-17-aec-erle-on-the-ceo-rig.md`):
/// Mac mini Speakers out, Elgato Wave:3 in, steady-state ERLE of **−0.5 … +0.7 dB** across five
/// live runs — nothing measurably removed — against a residual that would have to sit at
/// **−52.04 dBFS** ([`crate::aec::CONFIDENT_LEAK_RMS`]) while the microphone reads −42 … −46 dBFS
/// during Rich's speech. The canceller does not reach confidence there, so Rich's own voice comes
/// back into the microphone, opens an utterance, and is discarded as taint **after every single
/// spoken answer**. Cleared-on-heard therefore means: he speaks, he is heard, the
/// latch clears, Rich answers, the echo is discarded, the notice fires. Once per answer, forever.
///
/// The crate's own doctrine on every other notice here is that a line each time is a drip that
/// trains him to ignore the one that matters. A drip about a STANDING property of the room is
/// worse than that — it is a drip that can never stop, because nothing he does changes it.
///
/// So it is said once, the first time the session hits it, and then never again. What is lost is
/// real and is named rather than glossed: a second genuine talk-over later in the same session
/// is silent. That is the honest trade on hardware where the app cannot tell a second talk-over
/// from the echo of Rich's next sentence.
///
/// Pure: no clock, no channel, no observer.
///
/// ## AND IT IS NOW ONE BUDGET FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY — defect 1 of the candidate-.6 walk
///
/// Ray walked the first spoken answer of a voice session on the CEO's screen on 2026-09-17 and
/// **three** notice cards stacked up in his thread while he had said nothing since 21:31:09
/// (`docs/verification/2026-09-17-nightly-1.2.0-20260917.6-onscreen-audit.md` defect 1,
/// frame `a6-08`):
///
/// ```text
///   "While I was speaking, I couldn't tell your voice from my own — …"
///   "That didn't come through as speech, so I haven't sent anything. I'm still listening."
///   "I didn't catch that, so I haven't sent anything. I'm still listening."
/// ```
///
/// **Every one of the three latches was working exactly as written.** Each honored "at most
/// once"; there were three of them, in two different threads, that had never been introduced.
/// *"The brief's expectation — 'On speakers you should see it at most once per voice session'
/// — is literally true of that one notice and not true of what a person sees."*
///
/// ## WHERE THE THREE PATHS MEET — read from source, and the answer was NOWHERE
///
/// | sentence | emitted at | precondition |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | [`VoiceNotice::CouldNotListenWhileSpeaking`] | [`supervise`], `CapMsg::Discarded { tainted: true }` | supervisor thread |
/// | [`VoiceNotice::HeardNoVoice`] | [`RecognizerDesk::handle`] | recognizer thread |
/// | [`VoiceNotice::DidNotCatchThat`] | [`RecognizerDesk::handle`] | recognizer thread |
/// | [`VoiceNotice::SoundButNoWords`] | [`RecognizerDesk::handle`] | recognizer thread |
///
/// **A CORRECTION TO THE OBVIOUS THEORY, because it is wrong and it would have produced a
/// no-op fix.** The natural reading of Ray's three cards is that echo-discarded audio produces
/// all three. It cannot: on the tainted branch of [`CaptureBrain::push_residual`] the
/// `Utterance` value is **dropped** and only `CapMsg::Discarded` is sent, `supervise`'s
/// `Discarded` arm never touches `utt_tx`, and [`RecognizerDesk::handle`] is reachable only
/// through `utt_rx`. So audio discarded as Rich's own echo can never reach whisper and can
/// never raise either recognizer notice. Suppressing them "on the discard path" would suppress
/// nothing, because there is no such path. Pinned by
/// `echo_discarded_audio_can_never_raise_a_recognizer_notice`.
///
/// What actually produced cards 2 and 3 is the defect audit-5 already filed as its #8 —
/// *"One non-speech sound produced two notice cards, back to back"* — an utterance the app
/// ADMITTED (so Rich was not audible for it) whose audio failed the pre-whisper gate and whose
/// successor failed the post-whisper one. Two refusals, two independent latches, two cards, one
/// noise. Card 1 is the echo discard; cards 2 and 3 are that pair.
///
/// ## THE RULE: ONE CARD AT A TIME, REPLACED ONLY BY A STRICTLY STRONGER ONE
///
/// Not a flat "one per session" budget, because that would silence the escalation this crate
/// deliberately has: a run of three discards is supposed to hand over from the short line to
/// [`VoiceNotice::SoundButNoWords`], which says more. So each sentence carries an AUTHORITY and
/// may only be said if it outranks whatever is currently standing:
///
/// ```text
///   3  CouldNotListenWhileSpeaking   the room and the hardware; a standing property
///   2  SoundButNoWords               a RUN of refusals; stronger than any single one
///   1  HeardNoVoice, DidNotCatchThat one refusal, pre- or post-whisper
/// ```
///
/// Equal rank never replaces, which is the double-card fix on its own. Lower rank never
/// replaces, which is the third-card fix. The escalation 1 → 2 still happens, once.
///
/// [`VoiceNotice::ReplyCutOff`] is deliberately **not** a member and there is no method here
/// that can take it: it describes the ANSWER dying rather than audio being refused, it is the
/// one notice that is SPOKEN as well as shown, and it is latched per turn by its own caller. A
/// budget an echo discard could spend on his behalf must never be able to silence the one line
/// he hears with his ears.
///
/// ## WHAT CLEARS IT
///
/// [`Self::recovered`], called when an utterance is admitted AND transcribed to something
/// meaningful — a real turn, which is positive proof the input works. It clears the standing
/// card so a later genuine refusal speaks again. It does **not** clear the half-duplex latch:
