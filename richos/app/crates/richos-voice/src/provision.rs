//! Getting the speech model onto this machine — the judgment half.
//!
//! **WHY THIS EXISTS.** `.github/README.md` told every stranger who downloaded RichOS *"Voice
//! does not work yet. Typing does. Speech needs a model this build does not download for you."*
//! Everything under that sentence was already built: `stt.rs` resolves a model and refuses
//! calmly when there is none, `hardware.rs` decides which model this machine should carry,
//! `toolchain.rs` refuses weights that are not the pinned weights, and
//! `engine/voice/models/model-pins.json` pins the exact bytes of every model RichOS may fetch.
//! The one missing piece was the act of fetching — so a customer's Mac had a product that knew
//! precisely which file it needed and no way to get it.
//!
//! ## The split, and it is deliberately the same split the JavaScript already uses
//!
//! `engine/voice/provisioning/model-integrity.js` is pure and decides everything;
//! `model-fetch.js` does the network and decides nothing. This module is the Rust half of that
//! same shape, and the reason is the same: **the failure paths have to be testable without a
//! network.** Everything here is pure or touches only the local filesystem. The transport —
//! sockets, TLS, redirects, `Range` headers — lives in the Tauri shell (`src-tauri/src/voice_provision.rs`),
//! which makes no judgments of its own and asks this module what every byte it received means.
//!
//! That is also why this crate gains no HTTP dependency. `engine/voice/README.md` states the
//! boundary in as many words — *"The crate stays in its original Cargo workspace and does not
//! call Node"* — so the JavaScript could not simply be invoked, and a `reqwest` in here would
//! drag an async runtime into a crate whose whole job is to stay cheap to build and test.
//!
//! ## Ported, not reinvented — and the port is checked against its source
//!
//! Every rule below has a named counterpart in `model-integrity.js`, including the two that look
//! like details and are not:
//!
//! - **Order of diagnosis: absent → empty → CONTENT → size → hash.** Content beats size on
//!   purpose. A captive portal's login page that happens to be the wrong length must be reported
//!   as a login page: *"you are behind a wifi portal"* is an instruction, where *"expected
//!   487,614,201 bytes, got 3,104"* is a puzzle.
//! - **A failed hash is deleted, never quarantined, and never retried automatically.** Truncation
//!   IS retried, because truncation is what a flaky connection does and resuming is cheap.
//!
//! ## Two vocabularies, on purpose
//!
//! [`Finding::describe`] is the engineer's sentence and carries the numbers, the hashes and the
//! file name — it goes to stderr and into the record, which is where that detail is worth
//! something. [`Finding::ceo_sentence`] is what the CEO reads, and it follows the rule
//! `SttError::ceo_message` already set for this product: no paths, no exit codes, no model
//! filenames. Sizes survive into it, because a size is a fact about his disk rather than a
//! detail of our implementation.
