//! **THE CEO SAYS A SENTENCE OVER RICH AND RICH STOPS — pinned on his own recordings.**
//!
//! On 2026-09-18 the CEO tested barge-in on candidate .7 at his desk and said *"didn't work … no
//! matter what I said, he couldn't hear me"* — *"it all works re audio but not while Rich is
//! talking."* He was heard. The candidate's own log printed six utterances during one answer,
//! every one `tainted=true`, every one discarded, and the reason it gave was the true one: the
//! echo canceller could not vouch for the audio, so the fallback rule was in force, and that rule
//! wanted **5.008 s of UNBROKEN speech** (313 x 256 / 16000, re-derived in `bargein.rs`).
//!
//! Nobody speaks for five seconds without a gap. The debounce was never a discrimination between
//! two voices — it is a continuity race that echo happens to lose, and the CEO loses it too.
//!
//! ## The two tests this file is, and why they are one file
//!
//! A rule that stops Rich has exactly two ways to be wrong, they pull in opposite directions, and
//! the CEO has ruled on the trade: *a regression that makes Rich cut himself off mid-sentence is
//! worse than the current cost.* So both are pinned here, on real recordings of his rig, so a
//! future change cannot improve one without the other failing:
//!
//! | test | asks | fails if |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`richs_own_echo_never_interrupts_him_at_any_volume`] | the FALSE-POSITIVE side | Rich cuts himself off |
//! | [`the_ceos_own_voice_over_rich_interrupts_him_and_his_words_are_kept`] | the MISS side | the CEO is ignored |
//!
//! Each carries the other's positive control, so neither can pass by doing nothing: the
//! false-positive test proves a barge-in IS reachable on the same recording, and the miss test
//! names the echo-only recording of the same passage at the same volume that fires nothing.
//!
//! ## The fixtures — recorded once each, live, and never again
//!
//! ```text
//!   ceo-rig-2026-09-17            9.536 s   echo only, the CEO's morning volume
//!   ceo-rig-2026-09-18-nearend   25.579 s   echo only, output volume 60 — HIS FAILING TEST'S VOLUME
//!   ceo-rig-2026-09-18-nearend2  24.784 s   THE CEO'S OWN VOICE over Rich, 4.880 s of it
//! ```
//!
//! `-nearend2` is the one that matters and it exists because §53 (richos-hq
//! `wiki/ceo-decisions.md`, 2026-09-18) is right: the Mac's own speakers cannot stand in for the
//! person. Anything played through them takes the same acoustic path as Rich's echo and is
//! indistinguishable from it — Ray's `say`-through-the-speakers talk-over reached the microphone
//! at **-44.7 dBFS**, inside the echo's own distribution. The CEO reached **-18.1 dBFS** against
//! a **-46.7 dBFS** echo on the same microphone: **28.6 dB** above it. Those are not the same
//! experiment and only one of them is barge-in.
//!
//! **Nothing in this file plays a sound.** All three fixtures were recorded by
//! `examples/aec_capture --save`, one playback each, at output volume 60 read and never set.
