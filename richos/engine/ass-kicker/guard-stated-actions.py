"""guard-stated-actions.py — THE ANALYSIS HALF of the Stop-time check that a
turn's REPORT agrees with the turn's ACTIONS, in three arms:

  ARM 1  STATED, NOT TAKEN   the text states an action; the tool calls do not
                             contain it.
  ARM 2  THE TURN THAT STOPS a teammate's completion arrived in this turn, and
                             the turn ends having started nothing and declared
                             nothing.
  ARM 3  RECORDED, NOT       the text claims something was recorded, saved,
         WRITTEN             written down, logged, filed or made a rule, and
                             the turn wrote it nowhere durable. An ALERT to
                             the lead, never a refusal.

===========================================================================
ARM 3 — RECORDED, NOT WRITTEN (added 2026-10-02)
===========================================================================
The CEO, 2026-10-02, after "Recorded as a standing rule": recorded WHERE???
— "Get a hook added that HITS YOU WITH A HAMMER every time you claim to have
'recorded' something without actually doing it." The turn behind that claim
wrote one file, in the lead's private memory directory, through
`cd …/memory && cat > feedback_….md`, and the claim was a bulleted line.

THE CLAIM is read from the reply with list items INCLUDED (ARM 1 skips them;
this claim lives in them): a first-person act ("I've saved your ruling"), a
subjectless participle ("Recorded as the first job for the next session"), a
pronoun or rule-noun passive ("It's recorded", "Your ruling is recorded as
§59"), or a rule claim ("now a standing rule", "now on record"). Excluded, each
for a measured reason: denials, questions, conditionals, modals, quotes,
reported speech, other people's acts ("He …, and recorded the anomaly"),
result clauses (", so the gap is written down"), habitual mechanisms ("it's
logged every time"), media senses (a screen recording), noun uses ("Recorded
numbers:"), acknowledgments ("Noted that …") and references to earlier turns
("the thing I recorded an hour ago").

THE EVIDENCE is this turn's own tool calls: Write / Edit / MultiEdit /
NotebookEdit targets, and Bash write targets (redirects, tee, sed -i, python
writes) resolved against the command's own `cd` and shell variables; commits;
engine record commands (escalation ledger, acknowledgement logs, workspace
registry) with the entry ids on their command lines; ECS checkpoints. Each
target is classified: the memory directory and ECS are PRIVATE; scratch and
temp are nothing; a git work tree file is a REPOSITORY record; anything else
durable is a FILE record.

THE ALERT (CEO, 2026-10-02, replacing the refusal this arm first shipped as:
"check whether or not a 'recorded' claim was followed by the appropriate action
and then issue an alert if it wasn't", then "I don't need to see it. YOU need to
see it and do your job."). Per claim, the turn either wrote it to a durable
record or it did not:
  * a repository or durable file, an engine record command's entry, or any
    write at all: backed, SILENT. No SHA recital, no "where" recital;
  * "in my private notes" and the turn wrote the memory directory: backed;
  * the turn wrote ONLY a private note (memory or ECS) and the reply does not
    say "in my private notes", or points at "my notes" without saying private:
    ALERT;
  * the turn wrote nothing at all: ALERT;
  * a citation of an existing record ("it is written in", "already recorded"):
    not an act of this turn, SILENT.
The alert is one stdout line, RICHOS_RECORD_ALERT<TAB>text, which the wrapper
turns into a Stop `additionalContext` (the lead's own context). It is never a
refusal, never a block, and never a user-visible message. It runs on the
re-fire too, because the re-fire carries the reply that ends the turn. The three
misread classes the corpus replay found (a past confession, a teammate's "saved",
a description of an existing document) are not claims.

MEASURED: every Stop point in the governed project's lead transcripts (72
sessions, 2026-08-07 to 2026-10-02), replayed through this file by
ass-kicker/tests/record-claims.replay.py. Counts and the adjudication are in
ass-kicker/docs/stated-actions.corpus.md (ARM 3); the excerpts, which quote the
lead's replies and the CEO's questions, are in the private record only.

WHAT ARM 3 CANNOT SEE: a claim made in an intermediate text block of a turn
(only the final message is read, like ARMS 1 and 2); whether the record says
what the claim says it does; a session the workspace gate holds in recovery
(every Stop guard stands down there, by that gate's own contract); a write by
a command shape none of the parsers know.

Called by guard-stated-actions.sh, which has already resolved the two roots,
read orchestration.config and decided that this repository adopted the engine.
This file reads the turn, reconciles the report against the tool calls, and
returns the verdict. It never decides whether to run.

===========================================================================
THE DEFECT, WITH THE DATE AND THE SENTENCES
===========================================================================
2026-09-02, one session, seven instances of one failure: the lead WRITES A
SENTENCE DESCRIBING AN ACTION AND TREATS HAVING WRITTEN IT AS HAVING DONE IT.
Two of the seven share an exact machine signature and are ARM 1:

    17:49  "Zach builds it tomorrow."        turn's tool calls: Bash x3, no Agent
    18:29  "Frank breaks it first, and I     turn's tool calls: Bash x7, no Agent
            want him attacking ..."

The CEO's next message asked, in blunt terms, where Frank was this time — and
after the apology — "I said 'Frank breaks it first' and then wrote a status
report instead of spawning him" — his reply was that this class of failure will
never end, will it?"*

The same day he sent six messages of one other shape — "No Frank this time?",
"Next Sage.", then a blunter repeat of the same question — each one restarting work
that had paused because a teammate returned and the lead answered it with a
REPORT and no dispatch. That is ARM 2. His question, verbatim, was "when will
this pattern STOP?". There was already a prose rule for it (the working record:
"A land ends by STARTING the top unblocked item, then reports") and there was
already a GUARD for it — guard-idle-land.sh — and the guard's own observation
log shows why it let all three of tonight's turns through:

    finishes: ["Design the elimination of the worktree class"]  dispatched: 0
        verdict: backlog-empty   rows: 41   free: 0
    finishes: ["Break the elimination design"]                  dispatched: 0
        verdict: backlog-empty   rows: 41   free: 0
    finishes: ["Lease-based worktree design"]                   dispatched: 0
        verdict: backlog-empty   rows: 41   free: 0

Its term 4 asks the BACKLOG whether there is something to start, and the next
step after a returned design — stress-test it — is not a backlog row. So the
gate saw the finish, saw no dispatch, and stood down on a table. ARM 2 is that
gate's first three terms with the fourth replaced by a DECLARATION: a stop
after a completion passes only if the lead SAYS, in the documented form, why
this is one of the three legitimate stops. An implicit stop is refused.

The same day's measured lesson: every rule left as PROSE was broken, and every
rule with a GUARD caught the lead — six refusals that evening, from five
guards. So both arms BLOCK. A notice that names the failure and lets the turn
end is the same defect as a reaper that saw 14 unlanded commits and printed
CLEAN.

===========================================================================
ARM 1 — THE SIGNATURE, stated precisely
===========================================================================
    the assistant's final text for a turn states an action, and that turn's
    tool calls do not contain it.

Both halves are read from structure. The tool calls come from the transcript,
scoped to THIS TURN by prompt_id exactly the way turn-manifest.py scopes them
(that module is IMPORTED for the call list rather than re-derived — the
sibling that re-derived it collected session-wide and was silently inverted
for weeks). The stated action is read from `last_assistant_message`.

The prose half is a heuristic over English, and the engine has been here
before: guard-unresolved-claims.py measured `dispatching|spawning|launching`
at 17% precision and refused to enforce it. So the trigger here is NOT a word.
It is a SENTENCE SHAPE, fitted to the two real failures and then measured
against every real turn on disk, and only the arms that fired on NOTHING ELSE
are allowed to block. The rest report, with their rate written down.

Corpus: every orchestrator transcript in ~/.claude/projects/-Users-alex-ab-
femcboost/ (19 sessions, 1,268 turns, 1,213 with a final message, 2026-07-27
to 2026-09-02), replayed by prompt_id span exactly as the Stop payload would
present each turn, through THIS file. Method and adjudication:
ass-kicker/docs/stated-actions.corpus.md.

ARM 1a — ROLE ACT  (BLOCKS — 2 fires over 1,213 messages, both the defect)
    A clause whose SUBJECT is a roster role, whose VERB is present-simple
    third person, and whose OBJECT is a pronoun or a determiner phrase:

        Zach builds it tomorrow.
        Frank breaks it first[, and I want him ...]

    and the turn contains no Agent call for that role and no SendMessage to a
    teammate. Before its exclusions this shape fired 15 times; 13 were false,
    and every false one belonged to one of four classes, each excluded for a
    stated reason rather than by tuning:

      REPORT VERBS     "Frank recommends the hybrid", "Sage rates this the
                       biggest risk", "Sage comes back with", "Echo continues
                       on". Verbs of saying, judging, returning and continuing
                       describe a running or finished agent's OUTPUT, not an
                       act the lead has to take. That class is liveness, and
                       liveness is owned (report-only, on measured grounds) by
                       guard-agent-state-claims.py.
      LIST ITEMS       "1. Zach builds it — in flight now", "- Dean fixes
                       Sterling's definition", "5. ... Iris builds each". A
                       bulleted or numbered line is a plan or a status table.
                       Both real failures were plain sentences in prose. Lines
                       that open with a list marker are not scanned.
      BARE OBJECTS     "Art designs Bootstrap components", "Clark researches
                       what an art director is". A description of a role's
                       craft takes a bare noun; an announced act takes a
                       pronoun or a determiner ("it", "the design", "this").
      CEO PROPOSALS    "Say go and I'll start the hire", "say the word and
                       I'll dispatch it". A clause conditioned on the CEO's
                       word is a proposal, and ending a turn on a proposal is
                       legitimate. Also: an AskUserQuestion call this turn
                       exempts the whole turn, the same term guard-idle-land
                       uses.

    After the exclusions: 2 fires, 2 genuine, 0 false. Recall is deliberately
    the price — "Frank breaks the elimination design" with no determiner is
    not caught, and that is stated here rather than discovered later.

ARM 1b — FIRST-PERSON DISPATCH  (BLOCKS — 0 fires, 0 false, guards a case the
                                  corpus does not contain)
    "I'm dispatching Frank", "I'll spawn Zach now", "Dispatching frank-opus-x1"
    — first person, present or future, a dispatch verb, and a ROLE or AGENT
    NAME as the object — in a turn with no matching Agent call. This is the
    17%-precision word family narrowed three ways: it must be first person
    (past incidents and quotations drop out), it must name who (the "names
    nobody" refinement measured at 10.3% is inverted — a dispatch that names
    nobody is not scanned), and it must not be conditioned on the CEO's word.
    All 10 raw fires in the corpus were "Say the word and I'll dispatch it";
    after the proposal exclusion, none. It ships blocking on the precedent of
    the never-dispatched-role arm: zero cost, and a positive probe in the
    suite proves it can fire.

ARM 1c — ROLE FUTURE  (REPORTS — 2 fires, 2 false, 0% precision)
    "Sage will come back with the actual count", "Sage will fold all of it in
    and I'll land it". Both were predictions about an agent already running.
    Kept as a report with the number, so nobody promotes it without
    re-measuring.

REFUSED OUTRIGHT — measured and not shipped in any form:
    "Landed / merged / pushed" with no git merge or push this turn: 12 fires,
    every one a cross-turn reference ("Landed at `13e3f00ac`" about an earlier
    turn's merge) or a noun ("Landing rule enforced per merge"). The SHA-
    bearing version of this claim is already owned by guard-unresolved-claims
    against the repository, which is the right ground truth for it.
    "Running now: X" with no tool call: 5 fires, all status about work
    dispatched in an earlier turn or the phrase "running tally". Liveness
    class again.

WHAT SATISFIES A STATED ACTION — the quiet direction everywhere
  * an Agent call this turn whose subagent_type is the role, or whose name
    starts with "<role>-"; an Agent call whose input carries neither field
    satisfies every role (a call the guard cannot read is a call, not an
    absence);
  * a SendMessage this turn to anyone but the lead — a resumed teammate is a
    dispatch, and its `to` may be an opaque agent id that cannot be joined to
    a role here, so any teammate message satisfies every role;
  * an AskUserQuestion this turn — the CEO is being asked, and the turn may
    end on his answer.

===========================================================================
ARM 2 — THE TURN THAT STOPS, stated precisely
===========================================================================
    the turn's window holds a host-written <task-notification> saying an
    Agent FINISHED (status completed), AND the turn started nothing (no Agent
    call, no backgrounded tool call), AND nothing is owed to the CEO (no
    AskUserQuestion), AND the reply carries no valid `stop-declared:` line.

    THE TERM THAT USED TO SAY "no hold or end-of-day in his own words" IS GONE
    (2026-09-20, CEO ruling §68). No hook reads his sentences to decide
    anything. What it excused is still excusable, through the declaration.

EVERY ONE OF THOSE TERMS IS guard-idle-land.py's, BY IMPORT. The completion
signal is its agent_finishes() — the host's own summary shape, `<status>
completed</status>` required, a killed agent and a finished shell excluded by
the summary text itself. The declaration is its stop_declaration(), with its
three cases, its six-word and thirty-character floors, and its code-span
strip. Nothing here re-derives a term that gate already measured, and there
is exactly one vocabulary for "this stop is legitimate" in the engine:

    stop-declared: nothing-unblocked    — everything unblocked is genuinely done
    stop-declared: ceo-owns-it          — he stopped this, or his answer IS the deliverable
    stop-declared: waiting-on-teammate  — a teammate is running and the next step needs it

What ARM 2 does NOT import is term 4, the backlog. That is the whole
difference, and it is the reason the three turns above went green.

WHY THIS DOES NOT DOUBLE-FIRE WITH guard-idle-land.sh: the sibling refuses
only when the backlog has a free row; this arm refuses only when there is no
declaration. On a turn where both hold, both refuse, the refusals name the
same three declared cases, and one line satisfies both — a declaration is a
declaration, not a token per gate.

MEASURED (same corpus, same replay, through this file — the corpus file
carries the per-turn adjudication):
    turns whose window carries an Agent-finished notice     (see corpus.md)
      started something (Agent / backgrounded)                silent, correct
      put something to the CEO / held / off duty              silent, correct
      declared                                                silent, shown
      NOTHING — report and stop                               REFUSED
    Every refusal in the corpus was read by hand and every one was a turn the
    operator had to restart by hand. The number is in the corpus file, and
    the three named turns of 2026-09-02 are among them.

===========================================================================
WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE — stated here, not discovered later
===========================================================================
  * a claim about STATE that no tool call established ("three repos clean and
    pushed", "the scheme is untouched"). Five of the day's seven instances.
    Different signature, no monotonic ground truth for most of it; a stretch
    goal, not this file.
  * an announced act whose object is a bare noun, or that sits in a list.
  * a role the entity has not defined. Roles are DERIVED from the entity's
    .claude/agents/*.md and the session roster; an empty set makes ARM 1a
    inert (recorded as such), never guessed.
  * a turn with no final text at all. There is no report to reconcile.
  * anything after the turn ends. Point-in-time, like its siblings.

===========================================================================
IT CANNOT FIRE ON ITSELF, AND IT FAILS OPEN
===========================================================================
The refusal this file prints reaches the model on stderr and is never part of
`last_assistant_message`. The offending clause is printed inside double
quotes, so a reply that pastes it back has it stripped as quoted speech, and
code spans, fenced blocks (including ```ecs``` records, which carry the
sentence as before="…" text), blockquotes and headings are stripped before
any sentence is read. A reply that explains "I wrote 'Frank breaks it first'
and did not spawn him" carries the sentence only inside quotes and only as
reported speech; both defenses stop it. The declaration line the refusal
prints is indented under a code-span strip for the same reason, exactly as
guard-idle-land.py does it.

Every error path returns 0. A Stop guard that fails closed refuses to let the
session end, and the wrapper explains why that is worse than the defect.

Exit codes:
  0  nothing stated-but-untaken, no undeclared stop after a completion, and
     every record claim backed; or exempt, not evaluable, report-only, or any
     error at all
  2  BLOCKED — the final message states an action this turn did not take, or
     a teammate finished this turn and the turn ends having started nothing
     and declared nothing, or the message claims a record this turn did not
     write or does not locate
