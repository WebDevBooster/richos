# Which hooks read the CEO's words, and what they decide from them

**Audited at `dd6fb305` (richos main), 2026-09-20. 172 files: every non-test
script under `scripts/hooks/` and `scripts/lib/`, plus the three `ass-kicker/`
analyzers that registered hooks execute.**

**The ruling this audit answers (CEO, 2026-09-20, verbatim):** *"since when can
a fucking hook be **automatically** inferred from my words??? since when is such
a thing become reliably possible????"* — *"WHAT THE FUCK DO I NEED **YOU** FOR IF
YOU FUCKING BUILD GUARDS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO AUTOMATICALLY INFER **ANYTHING**
FROM MY WORDS???"*

In one line: **a hook may check what Rich DID; it never decides what the CEO
MEANT.**

## The premise this audit was given, and what it turned out to be

The brief recorded, marked unverified, that the only hook reading his words was
`scripts/hooks/guard-stop-live-work.sh`, on the strength of one grep:

```
grep -lE '"role": ?"user"' hooks/*.sh lib/*.py     ->  0 hits
```

**That grep was wrong, and its zero was meaningless.** The harness writes a
transcript record as `{"type": "user", ...}`, never `"role": "user"`, so the
pattern could not match the very file it was run to confirm. The audit therefore
re-derived the question from the shapes that actually occur:

```
rec.get("type")   "role": ?"user"   get("prompt"   ["prompt"]
last_user_message   promptSource   origin.kind   get("origin")   transcript_path
```

run over all 172 files, with comment-only lines discarded, then every hit read
in context. Re-runnable: the script is in the commit message of this file's
commit, and each row below names the line that classified it.

## What was found

| class | count | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **(a)** reads tool input, Rich's brief or reply, or files on disk | 164 | never sees a sentence the CEO typed |
| **(a), was (b)-decides** — the removals in this pass | 2 | `scripts/hooks/guard-idle-land.py` + `ass-kicker/guard-stated-actions.py` |
| **(b)-quote** — reads his words, quotes them, decides nothing from them | 2 | `scripts/hooks/left-off-report.sh` + `scripts/lib/left-off.py` |
| **(b)-literal** — reads his message for a FILE PATH he typed, and acts | 2 | `scripts/hooks/commit-ceo-inputs.sh` + its analyzer — **left in place, escalated** |
| n/a — writes or fixtures a transcript, never reads one | 2 | `scripts/lib/app-evidence.py`, `scripts/hooks/contract-integrity-probe.sh` |

**Exactly one live branch in the engine decided anything from his sentences, and
it is gone.** `scripts/hooks/guard-idle-land.py` carried `HOLD_RE`, `OFF_DUTY_RE` and
`hold_signal()` — "hold", "stand down", "don't dispatch", "going to bed",
"calling it a night" — and TERM 3b, which stood that BLOCKING gate down on a
match; `read_turn()` collected his prompts as `said` to feed it, and
`ass-kicker/guard-stated-actions.py` imported the same predicate for its ARM 2
`ceo-owed` verdict. Deleted, not narrowed: the regexes, the function, the term,
the collection, the import site. The return dict now has **no `said` key**, so a
caller reaching for his words gets a `KeyError` at the line that reaches rather
than a quiet empty string the behavior could grow back inside.

**What the deletion cost, measured rather than argued.** The gate's own replay
of 1,082 real orchestrator turns is in its wrapper header: `0 were held by the
operator` — **the suppressor never fired once.** What it protected is still
protected, by the orchestrator's own act: `stop-declared: ceo-owns-it — <reason>`,
written in its own final message and shown to him every time.

**The defense the deleted code made for itself, and why it does not survive the
ruling.** It argued the error was one-directional: the predicate could only ever
stand a gate DOWN, never accuse anybody, so a false positive cost one un-fired
gate. That is true. It is also beside the point — **standing a blocking gate
down IS a decision**, and it was being taken from a sentence he typed for a
person to read. A direction of error is a property of a mistake; the ruling is
about who is entitled to make the judgment at all.

## The four (b) rows that remain, each stated plainly

**`scripts/hooks/left-off-report.sh` + `scripts/lib/left-off.py` — (b)-quote, KEPT.** They read his
past turns and reproduce the last one **verbatim** under the heading `HIS LAST
MESSAGE BEFORE THE GAP`. Nothing is inferred from the text: the report fires on
`(now - anchor_when)` in seconds, and the only content-derived branch is
`drop_current_prompt()`, a byte-identity comparison that avoids quoting his
message back to him in the same turn he sent it. Quoting him is what the brief
explicitly allows; this is the whole of what they do.

**`scripts/hooks/commit-ceo-inputs.sh` + its analyzer — (b)-literal, KEPT AND ESCALATED.** This one
is a genuine collision between two of his rulings and it is not mine to settle.
It reads his `UserPromptSubmit` message, extracts **path literals** (absolute,
`~`-rooted, backticked, quoted — `candidates()` line 235, whose own header says
`BARE WORDS ARE NEVER GUESSED AT`; there is no intent predicate anywhere in the
file), and **commits** any file he handed over that the record is not holding.
That is a decision taken from his message. It is also the mechanism he ordered
by name on 2026-09-05 — *"'it does not commit for you': Then who commits for me?
Santa Claus?"* — after a specification driving live changes to a public
repository sat untracked on his disk.

The distinction I would draw, and it is a claim, not a finding: recognizing a
**path he typed** is recognizing a reference, not deciding a meaning, in the way
that `HOLD_RE` decided he had ordered a stop. But it is still his message
steering a hook, so it is named here rather than quietly kept, and the call is
his. Escalation raised the same day; ledger id in the final handoff.

## Two things this audit checked because the brief named them, and cleared

* **`scripts/hooks/guard-ceo-ask-first.sh`, `scripts/lib/ceo-asks.py`,
  `scripts/lib/ceo-todos.py`, `scripts/hooks/notice-ceo-asks.sh`** — a TODO is discharged by **Rich asking**, witnessed at
  `PostToolUse[AskUserQuestion]` from the call's own `tool_input` (the question
  Rich wrote). **His answer is never read**, and no reply of his is parsed to
  mark anything answered.
* **`scripts/lib/ceo-ruled.sh` and its analyzer,
  `scripts/hooks/guard-ceo-ruled-ask.sh`, `scripts/hooks/notice-ceo-ruled-prose.sh`** — these match Rich's pending question against
  the **headings** of rulings in the CEO decisions page and the open-items page of the PRIVATE record
  repository, and in this repository's own `CLAUDE.md`. Those are Rich-authored records, and the anchor is a title, not
  his speech. the ceo-ruled analyzer's own header is explicit that it does not attempt
  to decide whether a ruling ANSWERS a question, "no text predicate can".
* **`scripts/hooks/notice-unasked-deferral.sh` /
  `scripts/hooks/guard-unasked-deferral.py`, `scripts/hooks/guard-stated-actions.sh`,
  `scripts/hooks/guard-brief-scope.sh`** — all classify the
  **orchestrator's** `last_assistant_message` or its Agent brief. In
  `scripts/hooks/guard-unasked-deferral.py` a `type == "user"` record is read as a **turn
  boundary** (line 367 `break`s the backward walk) and its content is never
  touched.
* **The `UserPromptSubmit` registrations** in `hooks/hooks.json` are exactly two,
  `scripts/hooks/commit-ceo-inputs.sh` and `scripts/hooks/left-off-report.sh`, both adjudicated above.

## How to re-run this

The twelve files that read the transcript and are classed (a) were each checked
twice: once for the pattern set, and once for a content read of a user record —

```
grep -nE '"user"|"assistant"|type.*==.*user|role.*user' <file>
```

which returns nothing in every one of them (the single hit in
`scripts/hooks/notice-inflight-sends.sh` is the string `"user"` in a list of lead-channel
names, not a transcript read). They join on `tool_use` / `tool_result` blocks and
agent ids — Rich's acts.

## Enforcement

Hooks snapshot at session start. **The removals take effect from Rich's next
session**, not this one.
