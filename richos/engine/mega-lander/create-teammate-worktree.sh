# create-teammate-worktree.sh — THE ONLY WAY TO GIVE A TEAMMATE A WORKSPACE IN
# ANOTHER REPOSITORY. The page: docs/plans/worktree-spec-2026-09-11.md.
#
# NORMALLY YOU DO NOT RUN THIS DIRECTLY. `scripts/spawn.sh` runs it as one step
# of one command, having already resolved the repository by name, recorded or
# repaired the branch this work integrates on, and evaluated every
# PreToolUse[Agent] guard against the payload — so the refusals below are found
# and reported TOGETHER before anything is created, rather than one per round
# trip. This file stays the only creator, and stays runnable on its own.
#
#   1. "Every non-native Claude workspace is named cc/."            (point 1)
#   3. "If registration fails, the spawn does not happen. Creating a
#       non-native workspace not named cc/ is refused."             (point 3)
#
# WHAT IT DOES, in order — and it stops at the first refusal:
#   1. Refuses a name that is not <role>-<model>-<identifier> (the spawn
#      contract), a path that already exists, a branch that already exists,
#      and a base that is a codex/ branch (point 2: an agent works from a copy
#      in its own cc/ workspace, never inside a codex/ one).
#      A SECOND REPOSITORY UNDER THE SAME NAME IS NOT ONE OF THOSE REFUSALS.
#      Run it again with a different <repo> and the same <teammate-name>: the
#      teammate gets a second registered cc/ workspace, and all of an agent's
#      workspaces go together when its work is landed or discarded (point 10).
#      What stays refused is a second workspace in the SAME repository under
#      that name - it would want the same cc/<name> branch, which already
#      exists there (point 3, one registration per repository). Normally you do
#      not run this twice either: `spawn.sh --repo A --repo B` does both.
#   2. REGISTERS the workspace — session, teammate, repository, path, cc/
#      branch — in the workspace registry (mega-lander/workspaces.py) BEFORE
#      anything exists on disk. If the registration cannot be written, nothing
#      is created, so no spawn can name the workspace.
#   3. `git worktree add <dir> -b cc/<name> <base>` in the repository's MAIN
#      checkout (resolved through `git worktree list`, never guessed).
#   4. Seeds every gitignored file matching a `.worktreeinclude` pattern from
#      the main checkout — the same contract native isolation honors.
#  4b. Runs the repository's own `.worktree-setup`, if it has one, inside the
#      new workspace. That is where a repository puts the things every one of
#      its worktrees needs and none of them should build for itself — richos
#      points its cargo target/ at the one shared build cache there. NEVER
#      FATAL: a workspace whose setup failed is a workspace that works and
#      rebuilds more, which is not a reason to refuse a teammate a place to
#      stand. It is reported, loudly, and it is bounded — a setup script that
#      hangs would otherwise hang every spawn on the machine.
#   5. Confirms the registration: created. If creation failed, the
#      registration records that instead; the agent was never spawned, so it
#      counts as finished, and whatever git left behind (a branch) is deleted
#      by the page's own land — an agent that produced nothing counts as landed
#      (point 7). This script deletes nothing.
#   6. Prints the path and the spawn contract that carries it.
#
# USAGE
#   ~/.claude/richos-engine/mega-lander/create-teammate-worktree.sh <repo> <teammate-name> [--dir <path>]
#       [--base <ref>] [--session <id>]

#   <repo>            any path inside the target repository
#   <teammate-name>   the name the spawn will carry, e.g. echo-opus-bt2
#   --dir <path>      where to put it; default <main>-wt/<name> beside the
#                     main checkout (the convention this machine already uses)
#   --base <ref>      branch point; default the main checkout's HEAD. To
#                     continue a finished agent's work (point 7), its branch:
#                     --base cc/<old-name>, and spawn with `continues: <old-name>`.
#   --session <id>    the session the spawn will run in; default the session
#                     this command runs in (its recorded process is an ancestor)
