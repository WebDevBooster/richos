# workspace-spec-fourteen.mutation.sh — EVERY ONE OF THE FOURTEEN CHECKS, WATCHED
# GOING RED FOR ITS OWN REASON. Invoked by workspace-spec-fourteen.test.sh; the
# loop is scripts/lib/mutation-harness.sh.
#
# THE BAR, AND WHERE IT CAME FROM. Round-6 brief §6, after the CEO's ruling of
# 2026-09-12 (lifecycle-failure-record-2026-09-12.md §2d): "why is there any
# need to 'imagine' anything if there is a shitload of transcripts from previous
# sessions and this one?" So every mutant here carries one of two labels, in its
# NAME and in its reason:
#
#   R-  RECORDED      derived from a named incident: the record file, its
#                     section, the date, and the commit where the record has
#                     one. Where the record holds ANY mechanical incident for a
#                     point, at least one R- mutant is required.
#   S-  SPEC-DERIVED  the negation of the CEO's sentence, and labeled as
#                     constructed rather than found.
#
# A point with no R- mutant SAYS SO in the report rather than passing quietly:
# points 1 and 2 have no mechanical incident anywhere in the three records
# (lifecycle-failure-record-2026-09-{10,11,12}.md) — the four pre-spec
# `zach-opus-dor*` trees are excluded by the CEO's own second sentence of point
# 1 and are not a failure of this code, and no codex/ workspace has ever been
# touched — so both carry S- mutants only. The count per point is printed by
# the measurement report from the PASS lines below.
#
# EVERY WANT NAMES A SUB-ASSERTION (`C4.3 `), NEVER A CHECK (`C4 `). Check C14
# was red on the base round 6 was written against (its C14.1: the first spawn
# with no integration branch recorded was not refused), so any mutant wanting
# `FAIL  C14 ` would have been "proven" by a suite that was red before the
# mutation was applied. The trailing space in each want keeps `C1.1 ` from
# matching `C1.10`.
#
# ROUND 7 (2026-09-12) ADDED A MUTANT FOR EVERY SUB-ASSERTION IT ADDED: C14.1
# (green since the spawn refusal), the clauses both round-6 reviewers found the
# fourteen did not ask, and what the census of every sentence then found. Each
# carries its R-/S- label like the rest; the report counts them per point.
#
# Run directly: mega-lander/tests/workspace-spec-fourteen.mutation.sh
# Exit 0 = every property is proven load-bearing.
