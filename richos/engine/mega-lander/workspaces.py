"""workspaces.py — THE CEO'S WORKSPACE SPEC, AND NOTHING ELSE.

The only reference is docs/plans/worktree-spec-2026-09-11.md (fourteen
points). Every rule in this file names the point it implements. Nothing here
asks whether an agent is alive: an agent is FINISHED when a recorded fact says
so (point 11, point 12), and a workspace is deleted when its work is LANDED or
DISCARDED (points 4, 7) — by this file, and by nothing else in the engine.

THE TWO EVENTS (point 3)
    1. spawned   -> every workspace registered   (register_cc, register_spawn,
                                                   bind_agent, record_start)
    2. landed or discarded -> every workspace and branch deleted, as one
                                                  (land, discard; retry)

STATE — outside every repository and session, one JSON file per agent:
    $RICHOS_WORKSPACES_DIR, else $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/state/workspaces,
    else ~/.claude/state/workspaces
      sessions/<session_id>.json   every session records itself (point 12)
      agents/<key>.json            one agent: its workspaces and its facts
      refs/<key>/<call>.json       the refs its repositories held at the START
                                   of ONE of its tool calls, keyed by that
                                   call's own id: its calls overlap, so there
                                   is one window per call and never one slot
                                   per agent (point 3)
      done/<key>.json              an agent whose deletion completed
      ids/<agent_id>               platform agent id -> key
      repos.json                   every repository a record has named
      integration.json             the branch each repository's work integrates
                                   on, RECORDED (point 14). Never inferred,
                                   never derived from what a checkout happens
                                   to be on, and never frozen onto an agent:
                                   the live record is the only answer, which is
                                   why a wrong one can always be corrected
      events.jsonl                 append-only history of every fact
      lock                         one flock for every mutation

WHAT IS RECORDED, AND BY WHOM (never inferred):
    registration   create-teammate-worktree.sh (cc/), PreToolUse[Agent],
                   PostToolUse[Agent] and SubagentStart (native)
    ref creation   the catch-all PreToolUse (barrier -> snapshot_refs) and the
                   catch-all PostToolUse (observe -> observe_created_refs):
                   a ref that appears BETWEEN the two halves of one of the
                   agent's own tool calls, and carries that agent's own
                   unlanded work, was created by it        (point 3, point 10)
    end of run     SubagentStop, and a successful TaskStop  (point 11)
                   a run the platform STOPPED gets neither: it is recorded in
                   the platform's own per-agent record beside the transcript
                   (`stoppedByUser`), which observe_platform_end reads (11)
    handed in      TaskCompleted                            (point 11, hole 7)
    pause/resume   a SendMessage carrying `pause-until: <what ends it>`, a later
                   message to a paused agent, or `workspaces.sh pause|resume`
    session end    SessionEnd, or the operating system saying the recorded
                   process is gone or is a different process  (point 12)

# `_restore_protected_refs` (far below) has to answer "whose land moved this
# ref?", and the answer is written by app.py's `integrate` — which imports THIS
# file as `W`. The import cannot go back the other way. So either the keying
# rule for the lock's path exists in two files, or it exists in the layer that
# already owns machine-wide state. Two copies of a keying rule is the defect
# class this subsystem keeps meeting: the copies agree until one is edited, and
# then two conversations take two locks while believing they share one — which
# is the exact before-state the land lock was written for (app.py, "TWO
# CONVERSATIONS, TWO LOCK FILES"). app.py now calls these four functions and
# declares no keying of its own.
#
# THE ONE CHANGE MADE WHILE MOVING: pathlib is gone. This module is imported by
# a PreToolUse and a PostToolUse hook on EVERY tool call of every agent, and it
# uses os.path throughout; these functions return strings for the same reason
# every other path in this file does.

    shape of an ordinary land.

    Until 2026-09-17 every one of those was silent. That is right for the
    lead's own land and wrong for another conversation's: the CEO runs two
    threads, their back ends share a repository, and the second one's land
    moves `main` under the first one's agents. Their snapshots, their bases and
    anything they recorded from the old tip are stale from that instant, with
    nothing saying so. The lock makes the two lands take turns; this makes the
    turn VISIBLE to the agent it happened under.

    SILENT WHEN NO RECORD NAMES THE MOVE. A land by another conversation is
    exactly the thing that writes a record (app.py `integrate`, under the land
    lock, right after the fast-forward), so a move that NO record names is the
    terminal path — Rich's lands there are a hand-run `git merge` that writes
    no record, and those teammates are already told by guard-inflight-notify.sh
    at the push. Calling every one of those "unattributed" would put an alarm on
    the single most common write a recorded branch ever receives, which is how a
    report becomes wallpaper. That was true of a repository with NO land file,
    and it is exactly as true of one whose file holds an older land: until
    2026-10-01 the first recorded land switched every later hand merge from
    silence to "moved forward by a land this repository's land records do not
    name", once per running agent per merge (hunt part 4, finding 24). The
    presence of the file says which conversation landed only when a record
    names the commit; it says nothing about a move it does not name.

    SILENT FOR THIS CONVERSATION'S OWN LAND. A record carrying this engine's
    own `RICHOS_APP_THREAD` is this conversation landing its own work; its
    agents are the one party that already knows.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# point 14 — the branch a body of work integrates on is RECORDED
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# "Landed doesn't always mean landed on main. Landing means merged into the
#  branch this work integrates on. Usually that is main. When the work cannot
#  reach main yet — not reviewed, or not ready to install — it is that work's
#  dev branch. ... The branch a body of work integrates on is RECORDED when
#  that work starts, before its first agent is spawned. Nothing infers it and
#  nothing guesses it — without that record there is no fact to test a land
#  against, and 'landed' goes back to meaning whatever main happens to have."
#
# WHAT THIS REPLACED, AND WHY IT WAS WRONG. land() used to resolve each
# repository's target with `git rev-parse HEAD` in the main checkout, at the
# moment of the land. So "landed" meant "in whatever the main checkout has
# checked out just now" — which is not a fact about this work at all: it moves
# when Rich checks something else out, it is empty when the main checkout is
# detached, and it can NEVER answer yes for work that integrates on a dev
# branch, which is the case the page's fourteenth point exists for. Work merged
# onto its dev branch was reported "not landed yet" and its workspaces were left
# behind, against point 4.
#
# THE RECORD IS A FILE, PER REPOSITORY, AND THERE IS EXACTLY ONE WAY INTO IT:
#
#   `workspaces.sh integration --repo <r> --branch <b> --why '<this work>'`
#
# Rich records it when a body of work starts. It is the form the page asks for,
# and the only form that can name a dev branch: nothing in this file can know
# that this work is not allowed into main yet. It is read at land time, and a
# land in a repository with NO record REFUSES and names that command — refusing
# is the only answer that is not a guess.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THERE IS NO FLOOR, AND DELETING IT IS THE POINT — 2026-09-12
# ===========================================================================
# Until 2026-09-12 a "first-registration" floor read the main checkout's own
# current branch, wrote it down as though it were the recorded fact, and froze a
# copy of it onto every agent registered afterwards; `integration_target`
# preferred that frozen copy over the live record. It fired from
# `record_session_start` — earlier even than the comment above it claimed.
#
# IT WAS WORSE THAN THE REFUSAL IT REPLACED, and the comparison that shows it was
# reproduced independently by two reviewers:
#
#   with NO record at all      the land refuses, Rich records the branch, and
#                              the land then SUCCEEDS. The refusal HEALS.
#   with the floor's record    the wrong branch is frozen onto an agent already
#                              in flight. Recording the right branch afterwards
#                              cannot reach it, its land refuses FOREVER with
#                              "is not in main", its workspace is left behind,
#                              and point 5 is blocked — against point 14's own
#                              "'it cannot go to main yet' is never a reason for
#                              anything to be left behind".
#
# A derived value that cannot be corrected is not a floor; it is a wrong answer
# with the authority of a recorded one. "Nothing infers it and nothing guesses
# it" (point 14) is the whole sentence, so the derivation is gone, the
# `source: first-registration` record is gone, and the frozen per-agent copy is
# gone with them. THE LIVE RECORD IS THE ONLY ANSWER, and because it is the only
# answer it can always be corrected.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE RECORD IS PER BODY OF WORK, NOT PER REPOSITORY — 2026-09-12
# ===========================================================================
# Point 14 says "the branch THIS WORK integrates on". The record had one slot
# per repository, read live at land time, and the code's own docstring called it
# "the branch each REPOSITORY's work integrates" — which is a different sentence
# and the wrong one.
#
# Point 5 permits a second body of work to start in a repository while the first
# body's work is running or pending integration. With one slot per repository,
# recording the second body's branch — which point 14 requires Rich to do — MOVED THE FIRST
# BODY'S RUNNING AGENTS ONTO IT, retroactively. Their work was merged onto the
# branch they were spawned for, their land was then measured against a branch
# they had never heard of, it refused forever, and their workspaces were
# stranded. The superseded value went into a `history` list that nothing read.
#
# So a recording now names a BODY OF WORK: an id, its repository, and the branch
# it integrates on. Each repository has a CURRENT body of work, which is what a
# new agent binds to when it is registered, and that binding is by ID and never
# by value.
#
# THE INDIRECTION IS THE WHOLE DESIGN, and it is what the deleted floor got
# wrong. Freezing the BRANCH onto an agent gives an answer that cannot be
# corrected. Binding the WORK ID gives one that can: the work's branch stays
# live and correctable — correcting it corrects every agent bound to that work,
# in flight — while starting a DIFFERENT body of work creates a different id and
# cannot reach backwards into the first one.
#
#   `workspaces.sh integration --repo <r> --branch <b> --why '<this work>'`
#       starts a body of work (or re-states the current one, if the branch is
#       unchanged: recording the same branch twice is the same work).
#   `workspaces.sh integration --repo <r> --branch <b> --correct --why '<...>'`
#       CORRECTS the branch of the body of work that is current, keeping its id,
#       so every agent already bound to it moves with it.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE SPAWN IS REFUSED, NOT THE LAND — 2026-09-12, round 7
# ===========================================================================
# Until round 7 an agent registered before anything was recorded was "bound to
# nothing, heals later": `integration_target` fell back to the repository's
# CURRENT body of work at land time. Both round-6 reviewers proved that is not
# a heal but a guess about WHICH body of work the agent belongs to
# (certification-sage-round6-2026-09-12.md §2, S1–S4;
# certification-frank-round6-2026-09-12.md §5): an agent bound to nothing was
# judged against whichever body of work happened to be current when it landed,
# so a second, unrelated recording made in between MOVED its land verdict,
# while a properly bound control agent was unmoved. "Nothing infers it and
# nothing guesses it" (point 14) is the whole sentence, and "current at land
# time" is an inference.
#
# So the page's own ordering is enforced where it says: "RECORDED when that
# work starts, BEFORE ITS FIRST AGENT IS SPAWNED." `register_cc` and
# `register_spawn` REFUSE when any repository the agent will work in has no
# current body of work, naming the recording command — point 3's shape, "if
# registration fails, the spawn does not happen". Every spawned agent is
# therefore bound at its spawn, and `integration_target` has no fallback: a
# chain bound to nothing refuses and names the command.
#
# The one kind of record that is never spawned through the guard — an
# UNREGISTERED workspace the point-3 sweep found (an orphan), or a native start
# the platform reported for a spawn no guard registered (provisional) — has no
# spawn at which to be refused. It binds at the first sweep after a body of
# work exists for its repository (`scan_unregistered`), and that binding is
# recorded on it by id and never moves afterwards; until then its land refuses
# and names the command. That is the only path left that reads "current", it
# is written down as a recorded fact the moment it is read, and it covers no
# agent this system spawned.

    Point 3 is "if registration fails, the spawn does not happen", and its other

    that then could not be made is a registration for work that will not happen.
    Leaving it costs the name (names are used once) and leaves a directory and a
    branch behind for a land to puzzle over.

    IT REFUSES ANYTHING THAT EVER RAN. No agent_id, no tool_use_id, no
    spawned_at, no disposition - if any of those is set this is not an
    un-happened spawn, and `workspaces.sh land` or `discard` is the answer, not
    this. The record is then deleted rather than dispositioned: there is no work
    to account for, and the event log keeps the trace.

    THE DELETION IS `_delete`'s, NOT ITS OWN, and that is the whole design of

    remove_workspace, then delete_branch, in a loop - and it was correct on the

    quietly kept leaving those containers behind, and nothing would have said
    so. "Land, discard and the retry are the only code in the engine that

    restarted agent is refused every tool, so it cannot write anywhere,
    including after its workspace is gone."

    THE LOCK-OUT FINDS AN AGENT THROUGH ITS REGISTRATION, and a read-only type
    had none. READONLY_ALLOWLIST answers one question — does this agent need an
    isolated workspace? — and the spawn guard returned exit 0 on it before
    clause 7, so the type that needs no workspace also got no registration.
    barrier() then answered UNREGISTERED for it forever: it could never be
    found finished, so point 9 never fired for it once.

    That would be harmless if a read-only agent could not write. `Explore`'s
    allowlist is every tool EXCEPT Edit/Write/NotebookEdit, so IT CARRIES BASH:
    a restarted finished Explore can write anywhere a shell can, including
    after its workspace is gone. The exemption from isolation was never an
    exemption from the lock-out; it only looked like one.

    So a read-only spawn is registered here, with NO workspaces, and nothing
    else about it changes. It carries no name contract (a read-only spawn is
    not required to have a name, so the key is its tool_use_id), and it does
    is independent of pending integration and has never stopped an
    Explore spawn and widening it is not this fix. Because an agent that
    produced nothing counts as landed (point 7) and land() returns landed for
    an empty workspace list, it is landed the moment it finishes and never
    becomes pending work blocking the CEO's turn ends."""

# POINT 3'S REGISTRATION, WHEN THE HOOK THAT WRITES IT WAS KILLED. The spawn is

# hooks, and a hook the platform kills still lets the tool run. Measured
# 2026-09-17 on this machine: `guard-worktree-isolation.sh` was killed at
# 10.027s against its 10s budget (orchestrator transcript, `hook_cancelled …
# timedOut: true`, tool_use_id toolu_01C3dCBDwFksv5tBHramMDch) and the agent
# launched anyway. The registry was then left with a NAMED record holding a cc/
# workspace and no agent id — `started_at` None, `end` None — beside a
# PROVISIONAL record holding the platform's own SubagentStart (10:57:50Z) and
# SubagentStop (11:13:58Z) for the very same run. `land` refused the finished
# work with "its run has not ended", and the only ways left to retire it were
# the ones point 11 forbids ("automatically and never by Rich noticing").
#
# The facts were never missing — only the JOIN between them was, and the
# platform records that join itself, in the same per-agent file
# `observe_platform_end` already reads: `{"name": "sage-opus-nightly1",
# "toolUseId": "toolu_01C3…", "agentType": "sage"}`. So the registry adopts it,
# at the next moment anything asks, exactly as it adopts `stoppedByUser`.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT. It does not certify a spawn: the guard's checks never ran
# for that call and cannot be run after the fact, so the adoption is recorded on
# the record (`registration_reconciled`) and in the event log, where a reader
# sees that this registration was repaired rather than made. It never invents an
# ending either — a registration with no provisional twin adopts an id and stays
# unfinished, because nothing has recorded that its run ended.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# point 3 — "any branch an agent created": ATTRIBUTION BY RECORDED CREATION
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A ref an agent created is the agent's, however it was made and whether or not
# it is checked out. A ref that already existed is never the agent's, however
# long the agent holds it. So the fact that decides is CREATION, and it is
# recorded at the moment it happens, against the agent's id.
#
# THREE EARLIER ANSWERS WERE WRONG, EACH IN ITS OWN DIRECTION, AND ALL THREE ARE
# WORTH KEEPING WRITTEN DOWN.
#
# THE REFLOG. git writes `branch: Created from <X>` identically whoever ran the
# command and wherever they ran it, and writes NOTHING to a workspace's HEAD
# reflog for a plain `git branch`. It missed the agent's own branch and handed it
# Rich's rescue copy: wrong in both directions at once.
#
# A WINDOW OVER THE WHOLE REPOSITORY, BETWEEN TWO OF THE AGENT'S TOOL CALLS.
# Every ref that appeared anywhere in the repository in that window was called
# that agent's. TWO AGENTS IN ONE REPOSITORY IS THE NORMAL CASE, and reproduced
# on this machine agent A's record held `cc/zach-opus-b1` and
# `worktree-agent-azachopusb10000` — B's, both of them. A's land was refused
# because B's branch was not in main, and `discard(A)` DELETED B's branch.
#
# POSSESSION: a branch git reports checked out at one of the agent's own
# registered workspace paths, sampled at its tool calls. That fixed the window
# and left three holes, which are one defect — it answers WHERE a ref is, and
# the question is WHO MADE IT:
#   the stray        `git branch spare` checks nothing out, so it was never
#                    attributed and was left behind (against point 10, "none is
#                    left behind").
#   the side branch  an agent that commits on a branch and switches away leaves
#                    work that nothing attributes: land() reported SUCCESS,
#                    pending() listed nothing, and the work was in no
#                    integration branch (against points 5 and 8).
#   the borrowed     a PRE-EXISTING branch the agent merely checked out became
#     branch         the agent's, and a discard deleted it with `git branch -D`
#                    (against point 8, in the destructive direction).
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE PAIR OF EVENTS, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES CREATION OBSERVABLE
# ===========================================================================
# The platform gives a tool call two halves, and both carry the agent's id:
# PreToolUse and PostToolUse. A ref that is absent at the first and present at
# the second appeared DURING that agent's own tool call. There is a catch-all
# PreToolUse (the lock-out, which calls snapshot_refs); the catch-all PostToolUse
# in hooks/hooks.json is the other half, and until 2026-09-12 it did not exist —
# which is why creation could not be recorded and possession was the only fact
# left to read.
#
# The pair is per tool call, not per agent-lifetime, and that matters: the
# window is the duration of ONE call, so it is measured in seconds rather than
# in the minutes between two calls.
#
# ===========================================================================
# ONE WINDOW PER TOOL CALL, KEYED BY THE CALL — NOT ONE SLOT PER AGENT
# ===========================================================================
# Until 2026-09-12 the snapshot was written to ONE path per agent,
# `refs/<key>.json`, and the first PostToolUse to arrive consumed it. AN AGENT'S
# OWN CALLS OVERLAP: this project's own agent instructions require independent
# calls to be issued in one block, and a backgrounded Bash call was measured
# returning 4.0 s before its process finished. Pre(A) Pre(B) Post(A) Post(B)
# therefore lost a whole window — B's snapshot overwrote A's, Post(A) consumed
# what was left, and Post(B) had nothing to compare against. A ref created in
# call B was attributed to NOBODY, and a side branch created that way took real
# commits with it: land() reported LANDED, pending() listed nothing, and the
# commit was in no integration branch (reproduced by two reviewers at 84e12d32,
# against points 5, 8 and 10).
#
# THE PLATFORM GIVES EACH CALL ITS OWN ID and both halves carry it: `tool_use_id`
# is the same string at PreToolUse and at PostToolUse of one call — the spawn
# registration has relied on exactly that pairing since it was written
# (register_spawn stores it at the Pre; bind_agent looks it up at the Post). So
# the snapshot is keyed by the CALL, in a directory per agent, and a Post
# consumes ITS OWN call's window and no other. Overlapping calls of one agent can
# no longer clobber each other, and a Post whose Pre never ran (a guard refused
# it) still attributes nothing, exactly as before.
#
# WHEN NO CALL ID IS PRESENT — a caller driving these entry points directly —
# the only pairing available is arrival order, so an unkeyed snapshot is written
# under its own name and a Post consumes the OLDEST unkeyed one. That is still
# one window per call; it is merely paired by order rather than by name. A Pre
# and a Post that DISAGREE about whether there is an id find nothing to consume
# and attribute nothing, which is the safe direction: under-attribution leaves a
# stray, and the land refuses while that stray carries anything unlanded.
#
# The open windows of one agent are bounded (_MAX_OPEN_CALLS): a PreToolUse that
# a guard then REFUSES leaves a snapshot no Post will ever consume, so the oldest
# are evicted rather than accumulating. Every open window is consumed at the
# agent's end of run, which is the last observation (record_end, stop).
#
# ===========================================================================
# TIME ALONE IS STILL A GUESS, SO IT IS NEVER THE WHOLE TEST
# ===========================================================================
# Other things happen while an agent's tool call runs: Rich cuts a branch, a
# second agent is spawned, a human commits in a worktree of his own. "It
# appeared while this agent was working" is co-occurrence, and the closing
# section of the page allows no guessing. So a candidate must ALSO carry THIS
# AGENT'S OWN UNLANDED WORK, which is a fact about the agent and not about the
# clock. Four filters, each one load-bearing and each one with its own mutant:
#
#   1. NEW      absent from the snapshot this agent's own PreToolUse took, and
#               present now. codex/ is never a candidate at all (point 2).
#   2. NOBODY   not a ref recorded on another agent's record — its workspace
#      ELSE'S   branch or a ref it is already recorded as having created — and
#               not the branch the main checkout itself holds.
#   3. AT       its tip is NOT already contained in the branch this work
#      STAKE    integrates on (point 14). A ref that is entirely landed carries
#               nothing, so attributing it decides nothing; leaving it is a
#               stray, and the page's own bound on the cost of that is below.
#   4. THIS     its tip is on one line of history with a commit of this agent's
#      AGENT'S  OWN that is itself not yet in the integration branch — equal to
#      WORK     it, or one is an ancestor of the other. "Its own" means every
#               commit its own workspaces have pointed at: their branch tips,
#               their current HEADs and their own private HEAD reflogs. An agent
#               that has produced no unlanded commit of its own in that
#               repository is attributed NOTHING, which is what keeps a second
#               agent's refs, and a human's, out of its record.
#
# WHEN, still: only at a moment the platform vouches for with this agent's id,
# and only while the agent is not finished. A finished agent's restarted call is
# refused before it gets here (point 9), and its open snapshot is thrown away, so
# a branch Rich cuts in the workspace afterwards to rescue the work stays his.
#
# THE ONE THING THIS STILL CANNOT TELL APART, named rather than papered over: a
# ref Rich cuts, DURING one of the agent's own tool calls, AT that agent's own
# unlanded tip. git keeps no record of where a ref was created, so `git branch
# spare` inside the workspace and `git branch rich/copy <the agent's tip>` in the
# main checkout are the same event seen from outside. It is decided for the
# agent, because the agent's stray is the case the page names ("any branch an
# agent created") and because the cost is bounded in both directions: a land
# refuses while such a ref carries anything not in the integration branch, so the
# only one a land can delete is one already fully landed, and a discard records
# every tip it deletes. Rich does not rescue a running agent's work — he rescues
# a finished one's, which is outside every window by construction.
#
# Cost, per tool call: one `git for-each-ref` per repository the agent has a
# workspace in (one or two) at each half, plus one small write. The registry lock
# and the scan of other agents' records are touched only when a ref that is not
# already accounted for is actually sitting there, which is rare.

# A REFUSED PreToolUse LEAKS A WINDOW, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE OF ITEM 2.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The barrier runs at PreToolUse and writes this call's window. If ANOTHER
# PreToolUse hook then refuses the call, the tool never runs and no PostToolUse
# ever arrives: the window stays open for the rest of the agent's run. Two
# things used to go wrong with it, and they need different answers.
#
#   THE WIDENING (fixed in `_before_set`). The end-of-run pass consumed every
#   open window and INTERSECTED their before-sets, so "the widest one decides".
#   One window leaked at minute one turned the last comparison of the run into
#   "everything that appeared during this agent's entire run" — and a branch
#   RICH cut between two of the agent's calls was then attributed to the agent
#   and destroyed by its discard. The answer is the opposite operation: the
#   before-sets are UNIONED, and the most recent snapshot this agent ever took
#   is always part of that union even when its own call already consumed it.
#   A leaked window can then only ever NARROW what is attributed, never widen
#   it, which is the safe direction: an unattributed stray is a branch left
#   behind and named by the point-3 sweep, while an over-attributed one is
#   somebody else's work deleted.
#
#   THE EVICTION, MEASURED AND LEFT ALONE. The cap evicts the OLDEST window by
#   position, so a burst of refused calls opened while a live call is in flight
#   evicts the LIVE one. That looks like a second bug and it was going to be
#   fixed here. It was measured instead, and it is not one: once the
#   before-sets are UNIONED, a window opened before the ref still decides, and
#   after a burst of refusals there is always one of those still open. Both an
#   age-based cap and the unpaired-Post fallback below rescue the case
#   independently, and neither can be told from the other by any scenario --
#   so the age-based cap was an unproven claim and is not here. What actually
#   rescues it is the fallback, which has its own case and its own mutant.

    The empty old value means "the ref must not exist at the time of the update"

    do nothing else: it cannot move a ref, cannot clobber one somebody re-created
    between the deletion and this call, and cannot oscillate with another agent's
    check, because repeating it is refused rather than repeated. It is therefore
    incapable of dropping a commit.

    The `-m` is not decoration. Until 2026-09-14 this call site passed none, and

    EMPTY message — which is why a day was spent working out who had moved main

    is written first, into the lease home the fence reads (baked into its
    launcher, never this process's environment): the ref, the value, and this
    process's pid and start time. The fence passes the creation of a missing
    `main` only when the new value equals the intent's and the intent's process
    is an ancestor of the Git call. It is removed afterwards. With the fence off,

    """ITEMS 2 AND 3 OF ROUND 8, THE EFFECTS CHECK. A protected ref — a RECORDED
    integration branch of THIS repository, or any codex/ ref — that is gone or
    has moved since the snapshot this agent's call started with is REPORTED,
    whatever verb moved it: a named one the Bash guard missed, an unnamed one
    (`checkout <it>` then `commit`/`reset`/`merge`/`rebase`, the doorway class
    no verb list can close — brief-audit-frank-round8 §2), from the agent's own
    worktree or from the main checkout, or a non-git write.

    A MOVE IS NEVER PUT BACK. THE CHECK REPORTS IT AND LEAVES THE REF ALONE.
    From 2026-09-14, and the reason is measured, not argued. Until then a move
    was "restored" with `git update-ref --no-deref refs/heads/<b> <snapshot
    tip>`, and on 2026-09-13/14 that line moved `refs/heads/main` in
    /Users/alex/ab/richos three times, twice within twelve seconds in opposite
    directions, while Rich was landing (docs/verification/
    ref-write-forensics-2026-09-14.md, events 3, 4, 5; reproduced from nothing by
    docs/verification/protected-ref-oscillation-2026-09-14-logs/repro.py).

      * THE SHAPE CANNOT IDENTIFY THE WRITER. This check infers who moved the
        ref from the shape of the result, and Rich's ordinary land has the same
        shape as the abuse it hunts — a land is the most common write the
        recorded branch ever receives. The old docstring conceded this for "Rich
        rewinding the branch"; the reproduction shows it fires on his plain
        `git merge` of the very agent whose window is open.
      * ITS OWN WRITE WAS AN INPUT TO ITSELF. Every restore manufactured the
        non-descendant condition that made the NEXT agent's check fire, so two
        agents holding different snapshots alternated for as long as both kept
        making tool calls. A report is not an input to the check, so the loop
        cannot exist.
      * A "RESTORE" OF A MOVE IS AN ASSIGNMENT IN EITHER DIRECTION, and it drops
        every commit made between the snapshot and the write. `--mode
        destruction` of the reproduction loses a merge Rich had just made.
      * THE SNAPSHOT IT WOULD RESTORE TO IS NOBODY'S DECISION: the oldest still-
        open window of ONE agent, which can be minutes stale, and which a second
        running agent does not share.

    A DELETION IS STILL RESTORED, AND ONLY A DELETION. A deleted protected ref
    is unambiguous — point 2 says a codex/ branch is never deleted without the
    CEO's express word, and nothing in the spec deletes the branch a body of
    work integrates on while an agent is running — and re-creating it is
    information-preserving: the objects are still there and the ref goes back to
    the tip it held. The write is CREATE-ONLY and carries a reflog message:

        git update-ref -m <msg> --no-deref refs/heads/<b> <snapshot tip> ""

    The empty old value means "the ref must not exist" (git refuses with
    `reference already exists` otherwise, measured on git 2.52.0), so it can
    never clobber a ref somebody re-created in between, can never move one, and
    cannot oscillate: re-creating a ref that is already there is refused rather
    than repeated. `-m` is free, and its absence is what cost a day of
    forensics.

    NOT REPORTED: the lead's legitimate move. Rich lands FINISHED agents' work
    onto the recorded branch while other agents run, so a move to a DESCENDANT
    of the snapshot tip carrying none of THIS agent's own unlanded work is his
    and is passed over in silence. Reported: the ref is DELETED (and restored);
    or it moved to a tip that is not a descendant (a rewind, a force-move, a
    symref); or it moved to a descendant carrying this agent's own unlanded
    commits (it committed or merged onto it — which is ALSO what Rich's land of
    that same agent looks like, and is now reported rather than undone).

    AND, FROM 2026-09-17, THE ONE DESCENDANT THAT IS NOT HIS. The CEO runs two
    conversation threads whose back ends share a repository; their lands take
    one machine-wide lock per repository, so they never collide — but the
    second one's land moves the recorded branch UNDER the first one's running
    agents, and until now that was the silent case above, indistinguishable
    from the lead's own land. It is no longer inferred from the shape: app.py's
    `integrate` appends a land record naming the conversation that landed, and
    `land_by_another_conversation` reads it. A land by THIS conversation stays
    silent; one by another conversation is reported, with its thread, its time
    and its two tips. A fast-forward that no record names is the terminal path
    whether or not the repository holds older records, and it stays silent —
    Rich's hand-run `git merge` writes no record, and those teammates are told
    by guard-inflight-notify.sh at the push instead.

    Returns [(action, repo, branch, snapshot_tip, found_tip_or_"", why)], with
    action "RESTORED" (a deletion put back), "MOVED" (seen, reported, left
    alone) or "LANDED" (another conversation's land, announced to this one).

    THE OWN-WORK RULE APPLIES ONLY INSIDE A WINDOW. A descendant that carries
    the agent's own unlanded commits is evidence of the AGENT's move only while
    one of its calls is open — the doorway commit happens inside a call. With no
    window open (the end of the run, compared against the last snapshot, which
    may be minutes old) the same shape is what Rich's fast-forward of the
    agent's OWN branch onto the recorded one looks like, made after the agent's
    last call and before its end signal; measured undoing exactly that in
    certification-sage-runner-round case R8 on 2026-09-13, and the land then
    refused. So outside a window only a deletion or a non-descendant move is
    reported."""

def integration_target(chain, repo):
    """(branch, tip, why_not) — the ref a land is proved against (point 14).

    THE ONE ANSWER. "Every part of the system that needs to know whether work
    has landed asks the same question: is it in the branch recorded for this
    work? None of them is allowed its own answer, and none of them assumes
    main." This function is that question. A consumer with no agent in hand asks
    `integration_for(repo)`, which is this with an empty chain.

    The branch comes from the body of work THIS CHAIN IS BOUND TO, and nowhere
    else. Nothing is inferred, no branch is frozen onto an agent, and nothing
    falls back to whatever the main checkout happens to have checked out: a land
    that cannot name its target REFUSES and names the command that records it.

    `chain` is the unit of work, and it is now a real input rather than a
    courtesy: a second body of work started in the same repository — which point
    5 permits while this one's agents are still running — must not move this
    chain's target. Each agent carries the work ID it was registered under; the
    branch is read live from that work, so a CORRECTION still reaches an agent
    in flight and a DIFFERENT body of work never does.

    THERE IS NO FALLBACK TO "CURRENT" FOR A CHAIN. A spawned agent is bound at
    its spawn or the spawn is refused (register_spawn, point 14), and an
    unregistered or provisional record binds at the first sweep after a body
    of work exists (scan_unregistered). A chain that is still bound to nothing
    REFUSES and names the command — reading the repository's current body of
    work at land time would be a guess about which work the agent belongs to,
    and both round-6 reviewers reproduced that guess moving a land verdict.
    Only a caller with NO chain (`integration_for`, a consumer asking about the

    `./RichOS.app/Contents/MacOS/richos-tauri`, which names no absolute path at
    all. Both tests miss it, which is exactly how it survived its own land.

    WHAT IS IN SCOPE HERE, AND WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT. This collects
    instances rooted under the paths being deleted -- the landing agent's own
    workspaces -- and nothing else. It does NOT sweep every scratch root on the
    machine, because a live peer agent's test instance is rooted under a scratch
    root too, and quitting a running colleague's app mid-test would be a new
    defect wearing this fix's clothes. The machine-wide arm belongs to the
    reaper, which knows which sessions are still alive; here we only know about
    this agent.

    A SURVIVOR DOES NOT BLOCK THE WORKSPACE DELETION, and that is on purpose. A
    window that will not close is not a reason to keep a landed worktree on
    disk; the two failures are unrelated. It is made DURABLE instead, so the
    §54 alert names it at session start and every turn end until it is gone.
    Never raises: tidying up must not be able to break the deleter it hangs off.

    passed the deny-list and spent the CEO's allowance. A textual ALLOW-list is
    wrong the other way: the CEO's own `[Image #5] …` turns (11 rows, origin
    human, promptSource typed/queued) begin with a bracket.

    Measured over every persisted transcript on this machine on 2026-09-13
    (2,591 files; 4,675 main-session user text rows; the census script and its
    output are in docs/verification/round8-fixes-2026-09-13-logs/): a row a
    person typed carries `origin.kind == "human"` (1,861 typed + 52 queued + 24
    suggestion_accepted + 92 through the SDK, all versions 2.1.217–2.1.269); the
    RichOS app's prompts through the `sdk-cli` entrypoint carry NO origin and
    `promptSource: sdk` (670 rows, v2.1.250–2.1.267 — an origin-only rule
    rejects every one of them); a notification carries `origin.kind ==
    "task-notification"` and `promptSource: system` (1,320 rows); a peer's
    message carries `origin.kind == "peer"` with `isMeta` (53 rows); hook
    feedback, image metadata and local-command caveats are `isMeta` with no
    origin (283 rows, none starts a turn); a compaction summary is
    `isCompactSummary` (8 rows, none starts a turn); and every main-session row
    with NO origin and NO promptSource is the platform's — `<command-name>`,
    `<local-command-stdout>`, `[Request interrupted by user]`, the 68 old-shape
    peer rows — 212 rows, not one of them a person's words. Both sides are

    """Reclaim the landed agent's scratch, right here, while somebody is looking.

    ONLY THE LANDED AGENT'S (2026-10-01). This used to run the whole machine's
    sweep, so landing one agent took every other agent's and session's eligible
    scratch with it: two lands that night deleted 141 entries, none of them the
    landed agent's. Now it passes the agent's name, session and workspaces
    (land_sweep_scopes) and the reaper plans only what provably belongs to it:
    allocations made from its workspaces and directories named for it
    (scratch-reaper.py scan_agent). Everything else it looks at is counted as
    unattributed and left to the scheduled sweep, and the printed line says how
    many. No scope, no sweep.

    A LAND IS THE MOMENT THE GARBAGE BECOMES GARBAGE. The agent has finished, its
    workspace is gone, and every temporary directory its harnesses made is now
    owned by nothing. Waiting up to six hours for the scheduled sweep means the
    next agent starts on a disk carrying the last one's leavings — and on
    2026-09-17 one agent's leavings were 105.3 GB.

    NEVER FATAL, AND NEVER NOISY ON SUCCESS. The land has already happened and
    printed its result by the time this runs; a sweeper that raised here would
    turn a completed land into a traceback and leave the operator unsure whether
    the land took. So every failure is one line on stderr and nothing else, and a
    sweep that reclaims nothing says nothing at all.

    It calls scripts/scratch-sweep.sh — the app-facing entry point, whose whole
    contract is "safe to call constantly, safe to call concurrently, one line of
    JSON" — rather than the reaper directly. That gets the flock for free, so a
    land that overlaps the launchd job or an app-triggered sweep collapses into
    one instead of two runs measuring a tree the other is deleting.
