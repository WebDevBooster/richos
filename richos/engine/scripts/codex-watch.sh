# codex-watch.sh: Codex's messages to the lead wake the lead.
#
# On 2026-10-05 Codex's "READY TO LAND" entry in to-rich.md sat unlanded for
# about five hours because the watcher on it had to be started by hand and was
# not. This one is started by Claude Code itself with every interactive
# session: the engine's plugin monitor (monitors/monitors.json), as
# quota-watch and stall-watch are.
#
#   codex-watch.sh --monitor   THE WATCHER. Looks at both channels
#                              (~/.richos-coordination/rich-codex/to-rich.md and
#                              rich-codex-questions/to-rich.md) every 15 s and
#                              prints each new entry ONCE, as one block with
#                              every one of its lines; each block reaches the
#                              lead as a notification. Ends with its session.
#   codex-watch.sh --tick      one look, printing what the monitor would print
#
# It only reads and prints. The logic: scripts/lib/codex_watch.py.
