# appinstances.test.sh — TESTED BY DEFEAT. A collector is judged on what it
# leaves running and on what it refuses to touch, never on a happy path.
#
# Every case launches a REAL process from a REAL executable named richos-tauri,
# with REAL open files, and asks the shipped module about it. Nothing here
# stubs the process table or lsof: the whole reason this module is built on
# lsof rather than on `ps eww` is a measurement of the real machine, and a
# suite that mocked the machine would have passed against the design that
# cannot work here.
#
#   A1  an instance under a SCRATCH HOME is COLLECT, and quitting it works.
#       The §54 addendum-4 case: the candidate-.7 instance left on his screen.
#   A2  THE NEGATIVE, WITH A POSITIVE CONTROL. An instance whose app state is
#       the operator's real home is LEAVE — and the control is that the same
#       binary, same name, same argv, under a scratch home, is COLLECT in the
#       same run. Without the control this case passes against a module that
#       collects nothing at all.
#   A3  an instance that IGNORES the quit request and SIGTERM is still ended,
#       and the module says how it ended rather than claiming it quit.
#   A4  an instance that survives EVERYTHING is a SURVIVOR, reported, never
#       silently dropped — the §54 "clean-up failed" branch that must alert.
#   A5  a process merely NAMED richos-tauri with no scratch evidence is LEAVE.
#       Deny-by-default: nothing is collected for failing to be on a list.
#   A6  scratch evidence AND real-home evidence is INDETERMINATE, and is left
#       RUNNING. Three states, never two.
#   A7  the executable's own location does not decide it: the SAME binary under
#       the operator's home, run against a scratch home, is COLLECT (this is
#       how ~/Applications/RichOS.app launched for a test must behave).
#   A8  an unreadable process table is INDETERMINATE, never "nothing running".
#   A9  the quit is addressed BY PID: the osascript the module emits names the
#       unix id and never `application id com.richos.app` / `application
#       "RichOS"`, either of which would reach the CEO's own window.
#   A10 the root set is DERIVED from the reaper's keys — changing
#       SCRATCH_TMP_PATTERNS changes what is collected, with no second edit.
#   A11 a directory under $TMPDIR matching NO declared family is not a root.
#   A12 the collector never reports itself or its own shell.
#
# Exit 0 = every case passed; exit 1 = at least one failed.

# A real executable, really named richos-tauri, which really opens a file under
# whatever state path it is given and then waits. That open file is the ONLY way
# a scratch HOME is observable on this OS (ps exposes no environment), so a fake
# that did not open it would be testing a signal the module does not use.
# IT IS A COMPILED BINARY, NOT A SHELL SCRIPT, AND THAT IS A CORRECTION THE
# SUITE FORCED ON ITSELF. The first version was a bash script named
# richos-tauri, and three cases failed against a module that was already
# behaving correctly: `bash` keeps the script it is running open on file
# descriptor 255, a NUMERIC descriptor, so the fixture's own path showed up as
# an ordinary open data file and every instance looked as though its data lived
# wherever its executable did. The real app is a Mach-O binary whose image
# appears only under lsof's `txt`, which the module excludes by design.
#
# A fixture that carries a signal the real subject does not have tests the
# fixture. Compiling it removes the difference instead of teaching the module to
# tolerate it.
