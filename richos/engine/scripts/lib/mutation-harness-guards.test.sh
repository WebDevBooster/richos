# mutation-harness-guards.test.sh — THE TWO REFUSALS, AND A REAL kill -9.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
# ===========================================================================
# mutation-harness.sh gained two refusals on 2026-09-18 after one killed harness
# left 105.3 GB, and a refusal nobody has watched fire is a refusal nobody should
# trust. These are the cases that decide whether that night can happen again.
#
#   G1   THE DESTINATION IS INSIDE THE SOURCE -> refused. This is the exponential
#        case directly: mutant-2 copies the engine plus mutant-1, mutant-3 copies
#        the engine plus both, and 13.0 -> 26.2 -> 52.8 GB is what that looks
#        like.
#   G2   THE SOURCE IS ITSELF UNDER $TMPDIR -> refused. A harness mutates the
#        SHIPPED engine; a source that is already scratch means a mutant is
#        running mutants.
#   G3   THE SOURCE IS INSIDE THE ALLOCATOR ROOT -> refused, which holds even
#        when $TMPDIR has been reassigned (several suites here do that).
#   G4   CONTROL — a legitimate copy of a real engine still WORKS. Without this,
#        G1-G3 pass just as well against a function that refuses everything, and
#        every mutation harness in the engine would be silently dead.
#   G5   the refusal NAMES the paths and the 105 GB, so whoever hits it at 3 AM
#        does not have to go looking for why.
#   G6   A SCRATCH ROOT ALREADY OVER THE CEILING -> the next mutant refuses to
#        START. The ceiling is on the ROOT and not on one copy, which is the
#        opposite of the obvious design and the only version that would have
#        helped: no single copy that night was implausible (13, then 26, then 52
#        GB) and asking "is this copy too big" answered no, four times.
#   G7   CONTROL — under the ceiling it is silent.
#   G8   kill -9 MID-HARNESS. A real allocation, a real SIGKILL, and then the
#        real sweeper. The EXIT trap cannot run, so this is the exact condition
#        of 2026-09-17 — and the sandbox must still be reaped, by the sweeper,
#        with no session and no cooperation from the dead process.
#   G9   CONTROL for G8 — while the owner is ALIVE the same sandbox is kept.
#        Without it G8 passes against a sweeper that deletes everything.
#
# Exit 0 = every case passed; exit 1 = at least one failed.
