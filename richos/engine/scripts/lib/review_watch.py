"""review_watch.py: THE SECOND REVIEW STARTS BY ITSELF, WITH NOBODY ASKING.

===========================================================================
WHAT THIS EXISTS FOR
===========================================================================
On 2026-10-08 the CEO fetched a Codex review of an agent's work by hand four
times, and each one found defects the author's own tests had passed. His words
(ruling §113): "A regular RichOS user can never be expected anything even
remotely close to that. So, this all must be completely automated."

scripts/second-review.sh (slice 1) does one review. This is slice 2 of richos-hq
docs/plans/2026-10-09-automatic-second-review-and-t3-ideas.md (§2.1, §2.4,
§2.5), with Sage's check beside it (...-sage-check.md §2, §4 row 2): the
watcher that starts that command by itself. It is the engine's plugin monitor
`review-watch` (monitors/monitors.json), started by Claude Code with every
interactive session as stall-watch and codex-watch are.

===========================================================================
WHEN A REVIEW STARTS (plan §2.1). Level-triggered: every look compares what
exists (the workspace registry, git, Codex's channel) with what has been
reviewed (the review ledger and the locks). Nothing waits for an event.
===========================================================================
  1. HANDOVER. A teammate's run has ended (the registry's finished_state: its
     SubagentStop, a stop, or its session gone) with commits ahead of its
     base, and no handover verdict exists for its newest commit. A worker that
     dies silently is read from the registry, not from its report, so its
     commits are reviewed anyway. A mid-job verdict does not stand in for the
     handover one: a mid-job reviewer is told to list what is not yet claimed
     instead of reporting it, so it never judged the work as handed over.
  2. A LONG JOB. A teammate still running has commits with no verdict, and 60
     minutes (LONG_JOB_MINUTES, an estimate taken from echo-fable-dict5's run)
     have passed since its clock started. THE CLOCK (Sage §1.2): the
     registry's start for the teammate, then the start of each review of its
     work; where the registry has no start, the moment this watcher first saw
     a commit of it. Never git's commit dates, which an author sets: a
     teammate branched from a day-old main commit is not "long" five minutes
     in.
  3. GONE QUIET. stall-watch's silent-teammate signal (no commit and no
     transcript write for 20 minutes, STALL_WATCH_SILENT_MINUTES) for a
     running teammate with unreviewed commits.
  4. CODEX'S HANDOVER (Sage §2 catch 1). codex/ work never enters the
     registry, so a READY entry in ~/.richos-coordination/rich-codex/to-rich.md
     naming a codex/ branch starts its review (Claude reviews Codex's work;
     second-review decides that from the branch). The original words are the
     to-codex.md entries naming the branch, else the one written just before
     Codex first named it; the READY entry is what the author claims.

THE RANGE IS THE AGENT'S OWN COMMITS: the base is the merge base of the tip and
the integration branch the registry records for the work (workspaces.py
integration_target), passed to second-review explicitly. On 2026-10-09 a run
over richos 2d5aaf844 with a wider range reviewed unrelated main commits.

Only repositories listed in SECOND_REVIEW_REPOS (the governed repository's
orchestration.config) are reviewed; record-only repositories are not (plan §6).

===========================================================================
ONE TIP IS NEVER REVIEWED TWICE AT ONCE (Sage §1.3)
===========================================================================
A file per repository and tip under <state>/locks/, created exclusively, holds
the review's process id and its start time. A watcher's memory is not the
guard, so a second watcher (a twin session, or the lead's own monitor beside a
host child) is harmless. When a handover arrives while a mid-job review of the
same tip runs, that review is stopped by its recorded process id and replaced
by the handover review; nothing else is ever stopped. No cap on how many
reviews run at once: second-review admits each by the engine's CPU rule.

A REVIEW THAT ENDS WITHOUT A VERDICT (crashed, refused, past its own 60-minute
limit, or running past OVERRUN_MINUTES, when it is stopped by its recorded
process id) is started ONCE more; a second loss is told to the lead, once.

===========================================================================
WHAT IS TOLD (plan §2.4, §2.5). Each printed block wakes the lead.
===========================================================================
  * every verdict, once, from the review ledger (second-review's
    reviews.jsonl): what was reviewed, by which model, its findings and what
    the lead can do;
  * a changes-requested handover nobody has acted on (no continuation spawned
    with `continues:`, the work not landed or discarded), again every 30
    minutes (REPEAT_MINUTES);
  * a finding still open through two rechecks in a row ("not converging"),
    once: the lead decides; the CEO is not paged;
  * a second lost review of one commit, once;
  * a Codex handover it could not turn into a review, once.
Starting a review is not told: the verdict is.

It never edits, lands, merges, pauses or messages anything. The only processes
it ever stops are reviews it (or another watcher) started and recorded: every
process of this user that carries the review's own mark (MARK_ENV, a random
value set at its start, which everything the review starts inherits however it
is parented or grouped), and every process in the session the review leads.

===========================================================================
COMMANDS (review-watch.sh passes --engine-root and --config)
===========================================================================
  --monitor  the plugin monitor's body: one per session, a look every 60 s,
             ends with its session
  --tick     one look, printing what the monitor would print
  --status   one line per running review and the last look's time

Test seams (review-watch.test.sh only): REVIEW_WATCH_STATE_DIR,
REVIEW_WATCH_NOW, REVIEW_WATCH_POLL_SECONDS, REVIEW_WATCH_SECOND_REVIEW,
REVIEW_WATCH_TO_RICH, REVIEW_WATCH_TO_CODEX; second-review's own
SECOND_REVIEW_STATE_DIR places the ledger.

    A regular RichOS user's app runs this as the host's own child (richos-core review_watch.rs),
    because a product lease loads no settings and no monitors (`--setting-sources ''`, Sage's
    check §1.3). What differs from his team's watcher, and why:
      * The registry is partitioned, one per company and conversation
        (<app state>/workspaces/<sha256>), so each look reads every partition.
      * Every connected repository is reviewed: the user connected it for this work; there is no
        orchestration.config to list it in.
      * WORKERS ONLY: an item is a registry workspace whose receipt says request.role worker; a
        handover reviewer's cc/ workspace is never itself picked for a review.
      * MID-JOB ONLY (long-job, gone quiet). A handover in the app is already reviewed, and
        `integrate` refuses without that review's pass (DESKTOP.md step 5, app.py integrate);
        a second handover review would only spend the user's subscription twice.
      * Claude reviews, on the CLI the app ships (--claude), with the user's own turn, kept
        beside the worker's receipt by app.py prepare, as the original words. Each review runs on
        the Claude account the app's work runs on when its reviewer starts: second-review reads
        the app's account list (--accounts) then, as a work lease is given the account in use.
      * Codex reviews instead when the user turned on the Settings switch "Let Codex review
        your team's work" (round 20.2, ruling §114; --codex-reviews, read when each review
        starts, app_reviewer), whenever Codex is installed and signed in; Claude otherwise.

        tool's background task reparented to PID 1, a command in a group or session of its own and

        read again, SIGSTOP whatever was not stopped yet, until a read finds every process stopped
        (a stopped process starts nothing) or FREEZE_SECONDS pass. Then every process outside the

        start; or this watcher's own child) and no read has found it empty, unless its pid now
        leads a session again, which only a new process can (owned_processes).

        A READ THAT FAILS IS NOT AN EMPTY SESSION (the real second review of 16c154f5a, finding 1):
        a process table that cannot be read leaves each review unknown, never gone: it keeps its
