"""publication-boundary.py — the content half of the publication-boundary guard.

Why this is a separate file rather than a heredoc inside the shell library:
scan-secrets.sh embeds its scanner because exactly one hook uses it. This
predicate is shared by TWO hooks — the write-time guard and the commit-time
guard — and a predicate that exists in two copies is the defect this whole
mechanism was built to stop. One implementation, two callers.

Contract with the caller (scripts/lib/publication-boundary.sh):

  argv[1] is a JSON job file:

      {
        "min_speech_lines": 8,
        "min_quote_words": 8,
        "corpus_max_files": 4000,
        "corpus_max_bytes": 67108864,
        "items_max_files": 5000,
        "corpus_may_be_empty": false,
        "sources": ["/abs/path/to/private/tree", ...],
        "private_files": ["<64-hex-digest>:<name>", ...],
        "items":   [{"label": "docs/x.md", "path": "/tmp/blob"},
                    {"label": "docs/y.md", "text": "inline content"},
                    {"label": "docs/notes/", "path": "/repo/docs/notes"},
                    {"label": "docs/z.png", "path": "/tmp/blob", "identity_only": true}]
      }

  "private_files" is material that is private BY IDENTITY rather than by
  resembling a recording — see the identity section below. An item marked
  "identity_only" is judged by that rule ALONE: it is how a binary blob, and a
  write to a gitignored destination, get an identity verdict without being
  handed to the text detectors. When EVERY item is identity_only the corpus is
  never built at all, so that path costs nothing and cannot fail on a corpus
  it did not need.

  An item whose "path" is a DIRECTORY is expanded to the files beneath it and
  every one is scanned. It is spelled out in the contract because the opposite
  behavior is what a scanner does by accident: `open()` on a directory raises,
  the unreadable-path branch skips it, and the run reports CLEAN having read
  ZERO BYTES. See expand_items for the shape that walked past this.

  stdout is one line per finding, tab-separated, and nothing else:

      BLOCK <TAB> label <TAB> detector <TAB> evidence
      BROKEN <TAB> reason
      CLEAN

  plus, as the LAST line of every completed analysis, what the run examined:

      CORPUS <TAB> member-files <TAB> corpus-words

  That trailer is the oracle for "this verdict was reached by looking". A CLEAN
  from a scanner whose corpus was empty is indistinguishable, from the outside,
  from a CLEAN that examined 130,000 words — and a regression test can pass for
  precisely the reason the scanner failed. It is emitted last because both
  shell callers dispatch on `head -1 | cut -f1` and pb_refusal skips non-BLOCK
  lines, so it extends the contract without altering it.

  An EMPTY corpus is not a CLEAN. When sources were declared and resolved and
  none of their files qualified as private speech, the answer is BROKEN — see
  the vacuity floor in main(). CORPUS_MAY_BE_EMPTY in the declaration is the
  committed way to state that a repository has no private corpus yet.

  Any other output shape is a contract violation the caller treats as
  fail-closed. Exit status is 0 for a completed analysis (clean or blocking),
  2 for BROKEN — but the caller reads the LINES, not the status, because a
  scanner that says CLEAN on stdout and 2 on exit is ambiguous and ambiguity
  here is what gets content published.

A note on the leading class, because it was measured and then narrowed.

It began as `[\\s>*-]*` — leading whitespace, blockquote markers, and markdown
list bullets. The bullet was the mistake. A CHANGELOG line

    - 12:03 Dana: rewrote the loader so it no longer reads the whole file

is a list item, not speech, and eight of them tripped the detector. So `*` and
`-` are gone and only `>` survives: a transcript pasted into a blockquote is a
real shape, a transcript pasted as a bullet list is not one anybody produces.
The cost is stated rather than hidden — a quote inside a markdown LIST is now
invisible to this detector — and it is covered by the corpus detector, which
does not care about line shape at all.

# --- media provenance: the third way into the corpus ------------------------
#
# THE HOLE THIS CLOSES, measured 2026-08-30. The two routes above are (1) the
# recorded-speech SHAPE and (2) the closure, which admits another RENDERING of
# something already admitted. Between them they cannot admit the FIRST
# rendering of a recording that was only ever transcribed to plain text.
#
# whisper's plain `.txt` output carries no timestamps and no speaker labels, so
# it has zero transcript-shaped lines and route 1 rejects it. Route 2 can only
# EXTEND a seed, never create one — so a recording with no timestamped
# rendering anywhere is invisible to the corpus entirely, whole.
#
# That was not hypothetical. Three real private recording transcripts sat in a
# declared PRIVATE_SOURCES tree — 5,713, 6,424 and 22,375 words — and the corpus
# contained NONE of them: it held ten files, every one a rendering of a single
# other recording, admitted because ONE timestamped rendering of that recording
# happened to exist. A 6,000-character extract of the first of those transcripts
# was written into the publication-bound repository and BOTH guards returned
# exit 0, silently. The write guard and the commit
# guard share this predicate, so the commit chokepoint — the backstop that
# exists precisely to catch what the write hook misses — missed it identically.
#
# THE SIGNAL, and why it is provenance rather than content. There is no
# reliable content shape for plain whisper output: it is prose, and every
# content-side widening tried against the real trees was rejected with numbers
# (see the closure constants below). But the tree knows something the bytes do
# not — the transcript is sitting NEXT TO THE RECORDING IT CAME FROM, under a
# name derived from it:
#
#     002 Jane Marsh podcast.mp3          <- the recording
#     002 Jane Marsh podcast transcript.txt   <- a rendering of it
#
# A text file in a declared-private directory whose stem extends the stem of a
# media file in that same directory is a rendering of that recording. That is a
# fact about the tree, not a heuristic about words, and it is the least
# ambiguous case there is: the whole incident this mechanism exists for was
# "the audio was correctly gitignored, the transcript was not".
#
# MEASURED, both directions, across 5,353 tracked text files in eleven
# repositories:
#
#   admits              exactly the 3 recording transcripts. The closure then
#                       pulls in a fourth file on its own merits — a reference
#                       worksheet 80.9% covered by them (763 of 943 windows),
#                       i.e. genuinely another rendering. Corpus:
#                       10 files / 83,793 words -> 14 files / 130,466 words.
#   costs               ONE new colliding phrase across all eleven trees: a
#                       single 10-word run, 8 of its 10 words function words,
#                       sitting at the MIN_QUOTE_WORDS floor and extending no
#                       further, which appears in 4 files in one repository that
#                       declares no publication boundary, so no guard ever runs
#                       there.
#   where it counts    ZERO, before and after, in the only repository on that
#                       machine that declares a boundary: the count of legitimate
#                       files it would block is unchanged.
#
# THE WIDER RULE WAS REJECTED. "Any text file in a directory that holds media"
# needs no stem match and reaches the SAME 14-file corpus — but it gets there by
# admitting a 51 KB mixed reference worksheet DIRECTLY, on the strength of a
# coincidence of directory rather than of derivation. Admitting mixed documents
# on weak evidence is the exact move that put engineering boilerplate into the
# "private" corpus and blocked LICENSE files (see below). The narrow rule
# reaches the same place by the principled route and leaves the coincidence
# unused, so the narrow rule is what ships.

# --- private BY IDENTITY, not by resemblance --------------------------------
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS BESIDE THE OTHER TWO, AND NOT INSTEAD OF THEM.
# The corpus and shape detectors above answer "does this LOOK like private
# speech?", and they were measured against the material that leaked:
# two-channel transcripts, and prose quoting them. They are sharp for that and
# they are BLIND to a small named file that is private for a reason no scoring
# function can see — a short note about a design decision, resembling nothing.
#
# Measured, both halves: that file's exact bytes were written into the
# publication-bound tree and staged, and both guards returned 0. The
# mechanism was sound for what it was aimed at and had nothing to say about
# identity. This is the addition; the scanners above are untouched.
#
# IDENTITY IS DECLARED, AND THE DECLARATION IS SELF-CONTAINED.
# Each PRIVATE_FILES entry is `<64-hex-digest>:<name>`, committed in
# .publication-boundary. Nothing here reads the private repository at guard
# time — deliberately. A guard whose coverage depends on a sibling checkout
# existing is a guard that does NOTHING on a fresh clone, which is the machine
# that matters: the one where somebody who has never seen the rule is about to
# break it. The digest and the name travel with the repository they protect.
#
# WHAT A DIGEST OF PRIVATE CONTENT DISCLOSES: nothing. sha256 is one-way, and
# recovering a document from it means already having the document. The NAME is
# in the clear, because a refusal that cannot say which file it means teaches
# nobody anything, and a refusal nobody understands gets worked around. That
# trade is stated in .publication-boundary's own header so an operator declaring
# the next file makes it knowingly.
#
# WHAT DEFEATS THIS, said plainly rather than discovered later:
#
#   * A REWRITE. Add or remove a word and the content digest changes. Identity
#     is exact by construction — the alternative is a similarity score, and a
#     probabilistic accusation is what index_corpus refuses to make.
#   * A REWRITE **AND** A RENAME, together. Either one alone is caught: the
#     digest survives renaming, and the name rule survives rewriting. Both at
#     once is a different file wearing a different name, and no rule short of
#     reading the private repository can call that.
#   * A PARTIAL EXCERPT under a different name. Half the file is not the file.
#     The corpus detector covers excerpts only for material that qualifies as
#     private SPEECH, which is precisely what this class of file is not.
#
# WHAT DOES NOT DEFEAT IT — and this is the point of hashing the WORD SEQUENCE
# rather than only the bytes: re-encoding (the seeded file is UTF-16 with a BOM,
# because it came out of a Mac text editor), re-wrapping, re-indenting, changing
# markdown emphasis, changing case, or pasting the words into a differently
# formatted document. All of those produce different bytes and the same words.
# Both digests are compared, so an operator may declare either flavor and a
# binary file — which has no words — is still covered by its bytes.

# A file larger than this is not content-hashed: the name rule still applies,
# and reading half a gigabyte inside a PreToolUse hook to compare it against a
# note is a guard that times out, which is a guard that did not run.

#
# WHY THE SHAPE FILTER ALONE IS NOT THE CORPUS.
#
# Measured on the real private record on 2026-08-30: 481 candidate text files
# under the declared PRIVATE_SOURCES, and the shape filter kept TWO. The
# verbatim-quote detector — the half that catches speech quoted inside ordinary
# prose, which is how quotes reached the public tree in the first place — was
# matching against 26,339 words, one recording, while the same private tree
# held SEVEN MORE two-channel transcripts of real recordings that the
# shape filter cannot see: whisper `.txt` output carries no timestamps and no
# speaker labels, so it has zero transcript-shaped lines. 3,764 to 13,880 words
# of private speech each, invisible.
#
# THE RULE. A private file joins the corpus when it is ANOTHER RENDERING of
# speech already in the corpus — not when it merely quotes it. Two conditions,
# both required, because each alone fails in a direction that was measured:
#
#   CLOSURE_MIN_WINDOWS    at least this many DISTINCT non-overlapping
#                          min_quote_words-windows of the file appear in the
#                          corpus. Absolute, so a document that quotes one
#                          sentence cannot join; distinct, so a file that repeats
#                          the same quoted line — which is exactly what a
#                          transcript with a hallucination loop looks like —
#                          cannot accumulate its way in on one phrase.
#   CLOSURE_MIN_COVERAGE   and that many as a FRACTION of the file's own
#                          windows. Scale-free, so a large document cannot
#                          accumulate its way in on boilerplate either.
#
# NON-OVERLAPPING is a cost decision, stated because it is a real approximation.
# Hashing every position of every candidate is 10x the work and measured at
# +0.8s on every single Write, Edit and commit in the repository — a guard that
# taxes every keystroke is a guard someone turns off, which is the same failure
# as one that blocks ordinary work. Every tenth position is an unbiased estimate
# of the same ratio, it is deterministic rather than sampled, and it left the
# admitted set and the margins where they were.
#
# MEASURED, not chosen. Against the real private record:
#
#   admitted (8 files)   73 - 269 shared windows, 25% - 45% coverage. Every one
#                        a genuine transcript of a real recording: two channels
#                        x two recordings x two model runs.
#   nearest EXCLUDED     14 windows / 2.8% coverage — an engineering brief that
#                        QUOTES the transcript. 2.9x below the gate; the lowest
#                        admission is 1.8x above it, and has to clear the
#                        coverage condition as well.
#
# and the reason that margin matters is the direction this fails in. An earlier
# draft admitted any file sharing ONE 10-word run. That pulled 251 private
# engineering documents into the "private" corpus, whose ordinary boilerplate
# then blocked 206 of 5,333 files across the real public trees — including
# LICENSE files, .gitignore and package.json. Admitting one mixed brief is
# enough to do damage: at a 40-word inbound threshold the corpus took in a
# single brief and its boilerplate header line and a scratchpad PATH promptly
# blocked five legitimate public files,
# one of them the technology evaluation .publication-boundary names as
# deliberately public. Under the rule above, both of those documents are
# excluded and the false-positive count across those same 5,333 public files is
# ZERO — unchanged from the narrow corpus.
#
# WHAT WAS REJECTED, with its numbers, so nobody re-proposes it as an
# improvement: harvesting every quoted prose run out of every private file
# (1,339 runs) raises recall on the one shape this cannot see — typed words in
# a private wiki page, quoted nowhere else — and blocks 98 public
# files, 23 of them in the publication-bound repository itself, including its
# README, its WALKTHROUGH and two agent definitions. Doctrine sentences live in
# both trees on purpose. That widening is not available at any threshold and
# the gap it leaves is stated in the header of publication-boundary.sh.

    THE WALK-PAST THIS EXISTS TO CLOSE. `git status --porcelain` reports a

    that passes that entry through hands this scanner a DIRECTORY. `open()` on a
    directory raises IsADirectoryError, the unreadable-path branch in main()
    treats it exactly like a deleted or binary file, and the scan reports CLEAN
    having examined zero bytes. Every leak this was built after was a file inside a
    directory; a new directory of transcripts arriving in one go would have been
    waved through by a guard reporting, on its own terms, the truth.

    So a directory item is EXPANDED here, once, for every caller — the write
    guard, the commit guard, and any by-hand run over a diff.

    Binary files are skipped by a NUL test rather than by extension: an image or
    an audio file carries no reproducible speech TEXT, and media was already
    covered by the check this mechanism replaced. Oversized files are read up to
    the same 8 MB bound the corpus uses.

    WITH IDENTITY DECLARED, a binary file is kept as an identity_only item
    instead of being dropped. It has to be: the first file this mechanism was
    seeded with is UTF-16, so it CONTAINS NUL BYTES, and every text-shaped
    filter in this pipeline calls it binary. A rule that says "this exact file
    never enters the repository" and then hands the file to a filter that
    discards it would be enforcement wearing the shape of enforcement. The cost
    is opt-in: with no PRIVATE_FILES declared nothing changes, and with them
    declared a binary blob is hashed and never text-scanned.

    # It has already bitten once, silently. pb_resolve_sources documents it: in
    # a linked worktree `../richos-hq` resolved to a path that does not exist,
    # the corpus detector went inert in exactly the place all the work happens,
    # and the only symptom was one honest line in a message nobody reads on a
    # PASS. That fix made the path resolve. This makes the SILENCE impossible.

    # The condition is derived, not chosen: sources were declared AND they
    # resolved to trees that exist AND not one file in them qualified as private
    # speech. A declared source that is simply not on this machine is skipped
    # upstream and never reaches here, which is deliberate and documented.
    #
    # Deliberately NOT a size threshold. "Unexpectedly small" cannot be derived
    # from anything — any word count would be a magic number that either never
    # fires or fires on a legitimate small private record — and this file's own
    # rule is that a number nobody measured does not ship. Empty is the one
    # threshold that means something on its own.
    #
    # The way through is CORPUS_MAY_BE_EMPTY in the declaration: committed,
    # diffable, reviewed by whoever lands it — the same affordance ALLOWLIST is,
    # for the same reason, and pointedly not an in-the-moment override.

    # can fail: because the corpus was empty and there was nothing to find. That
    # is the exact defect this file is about, and a suite with no way to tell the
    # two apart would be the defect reproduced one level up — which has happened
    # here before, in this suite's own tally and its own fixture filenames.
    #
    # Emitted LAST, never first: both shell callers dispatch on `head -1 | cut
    # -f1`, and pb_refusal skips every line that is not a BLOCK, so a trailing
    # line is additive to the contract rather than a change to it.
    # IDENTITY is on its own line for the same reason CORPUS is: an
    # identity-only run reads no corpus at all, so CORPUS 0 0 would be the only
    # thing a caller saw and "this run compared against nothing" and "this run
    # compared against four declared files" would look identical. The count is
