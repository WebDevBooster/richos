"""testdevices.py — a simulator or emulator a test made is garbage when the test is over.

CEO, ceo-decisions §54, verbatim: "There now needs to be a ROCK-SOLID,
UNBREAKABLE, UNDEFEATABLE mechanisms that always guarantees that garbage like
this will be always cleaned up afterwards. Or if the clean-up fails or
impossible for some reason, then Rich must get a MASSIVE ALERT about it". And
addendum 4: "Test app windows must always close/quit when testing is finished.
Same hygiene as with any other garbage."

WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-09-22 the CEO stopped ten agents from his own screen.
Three iOS simulators their test runs had booted stayed booted after he exited:
one `rios-ui-<pid>-...` from richos/app/scripts/native-ios-ui.test.sh and two
`RichOS native-ios <key>-app` from native-ios-app.test.sh. Each script deletes
its simulator in an EXIT trap, and a killed run never reaches its trap.
appinstances.py, the engine's one definition of a test instance, looks only for
the desktop app's process, so nothing collected them; Rich deleted them by
hand the next session.

THE RULE: OWNERSHIP, NEVER A NAME. A name says which family of tool made a
device; it never says whether anyone is still using it. A device is collected
only when its owner is PROVEN gone, by one of:

  registered owner   the exact simulator UDID or emulator process generation
                     records every live user; all registered processes or agent
                     runs have ended. A cache path alone never proves ownership
  creator pid        `rios-ui-<pid>-...` names its creator; the pid no longer
                     exists, or it started AFTER the device was created (the
                     number was reused)
  checkout           the per-checkout families (`RichOS native-ios <key>`,
                     `RichOS mobile loop <key>`, `randroid-<key>`) are keyed by
                     a hash of the checkout's path; the device is collected when
                     that key belongs to a checkout the engine RECORDED and that
                     checkout no longer exists (or is being deleted by the land
                     running this). An existing checkout without a live owner is undecided

Anything in those families that none of the three can decide is UNDECIDED: it
is never deleted, and while it RUNS it is written to the failure record, which
the disk watchdog raises as the MASSIVE ALERT with the exact command Rich runs
(a shut-down one is reported by the collector and not alerted; see
record_failures). A device
that would not close when collected is recorded the same way. A row resolves
the moment its device no longer exists, however it went. Devices outside the
families (an engineer's own "iPhone 16") are never looked at.

Every simulator command addresses one UDID (never `booted`); an emulator gets a
signal only through the pid its own launcher recorded, and only after its
arguments are read back and still name that AVD.
