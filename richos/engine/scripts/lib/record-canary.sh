# scripts/lib/record-canary.sh — DID THIS RUN TOUCH THE OPERATOR'S RECORD?
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHERE THIS CAME FROM — three instances of one class in two days
# ===========================================================================
# The leak canary (leak-canary.sh) watches CHECKOUTS. It says so in its own
# header: "It does NOT watch the rest of the filesystem or $HOME." Three suites
# then wrote into $HOME, and every one of them was green:
#
#   2026-09-10  finish-row-completion.test.sh wrote 130 `feedbeef` fixture rows
#               into ~/.claude/worker-events.jsonl, the platform's fallback
#               event log (Sage D4, round three).
#   2026-09-10  detect-nonnative-worktree.test.sh created
#               ~/.claude/teams/session-deadbeef/ with 25 KB of fixture names
#               (round 14, D4's sibling).
#   2026-09-11  session-start-stdin.test.sh case 9b ran the real SessionStart
#               reaper with a sandbox entity and an unredirected HOME. The
#               reaper read the operator's REAL team directories, discovered
#               the operator's REAL richos registry, judged a REAL agent's
#               cross-repository tree with an entity in which its shell could
#               not exist, and appended a `terminated` row (witness
#               platform-terminal-record, 2026-09-11T00:02:34.984941+00:00,
#               agent ae904aac1949e5696, sage-fable-cert3) to
#               ~/.claude/state/worktree-ledger.jsonl — for an agent whose
#               shell was LOCKED by a running pid. Both round-four reviewers
#               found it independently; the suite reported all 11 passed.
#
# Each was fixed in its suite with a both-arms control (F15/F16, L1/L2, 9l/9m).
# This file closes the CLASS: the runner takes a baseline of the operator's
# record before EVERY suite and compares after it, so the next suite that
# reaches $HOME is named on the day it is written, not found by a reviewer.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT IS WATCHED, AND WHAT THE WITNESS IS FOR EACH
# ===========================================================================
# `<config>` is `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}` AS IT WAS WHEN THIS FILE
# WAS SOURCED — captured, never re-read, for the reason global-state-witness.sh
# gives: a suite that moves HOME halfway through would otherwise be compared
# against its own sandbox and always pass.
#
#   <config>/state/worktree-ledger.jsonl   THE OWNERSHIP LEDGER. Witness: every
#        row EXCEPT `event: finished`, by content hash. The exclusion is
#        deliberate and it is the one thing this canary cannot see: the
#        platform's own worker-ended-handoff.sh appends a `finished` row at
#        every helper turn of every live agent on the machine (68 rows during
#        Sage's round-four pass, 48 during Frank's), so a witness that counted
#        them would be red on nearly every suite of a live-machine run, and a
#        canary that cries wolf gets muted — the escalations suite's own reason
#        for counting fixture rows rather than total rows. A `finished` row is
#        advisory and never decisive (worktree-ledger.judge: "advisory, never
#        decisive"), so a leaked one is residue, not a false witness. Every
#        other event — registered, prepared, terminated, retracted — is
#        witnessed, and those are the rows that decide whether a workspace
#        may be destroyed.
#   <config>/worker-events.jsonl           THE FALLBACK EVENT LOG. Witness:
#        every line, by content hash. Only a session with NO team directory
#        writes here (worker-*-handoff.sh resolve_team_dir), so on a machine
#        where the running session has one it is stable across a run (250
#        lines before and after both round-four passes).
#   <config>/teams/                        THE TEAM DIRECTORIES. Witness: the
#        names of the `session-*` entries and of their immediate children —
#        never contents, which the live session's own logs churn.
#   <config>/state/workspaces/             THE WORKSPACE REGISTRY
#        (mega-lander/workspaces.py). Witness: the names of its session and
#        agent records and every events.jsonl line, by content hash. A suite
#        that registers, lands or discards against it is writing the record
#        the Stop gate and the lock-out decide from (added 2026-09-11, the day
#        two suites wrote 55 test registrations into it before they were
#        sandboxed).
#
# ITS FALSE-POSITIVE VECTORS, NAMED: a real spawn during the run (a
# `registered`/`prepared` row from detect-nonnative-worktree.sh or
# create-teammate-worktree.sh), a real reap or removal (a `terminated` row), a
# session with no team directory writing to the fallback, or the platform
# creating a team directory or a first log file of a type in one. Each prints
# the row or entry it saw, so a reader recognizes the machine's own activity
# at once — the same trade the leak canary made for an engineer's own save.
# In CI none of the three paths exists, so there the witness is exact.
#
# ===========================================================================
# AMENDED 2026-09-27 — THE RUNNERS NOW HAND EACH UNIT A RECORD OF ITS OWN
# ===========================================================================
# The paragraph above called those vectors a readable trade. On a busy session
# they stopped being one. The canary compared the LIVE record before and after
# a unit, so every spawn, land and message elsewhere on the machine during the
# unit failed it as RECORD-TOUCHED: zach-opus-amspell3's proof went red three
# times on `contract-integrity.test.sh --only SCR`, and each diff held only
# other agents' spawn and land events. Engine proofs could pass only on an idle
# session, so every engine change waited for quiet.
#
# The question this canary exists for is "did THIS unit write to the record?",
# and a before/after diff of a shared file cannot answer it while anything else
# writes there. So the runners (ci-shard.sh, run-all-tests.sh) call
# rc_sandbox <home> before each unit: it builds a throwaway home, points the
# canary at the record INSIDE it, and fills RC_SANDBOX_ENV with the env(1)
# arguments the unit is run under: HOME set to that home (the ownership ledger
# resolves from expanduser("~") alone, so moving only the config directory
# would leave it on the operator's file), and every variable whose value is the
# operator's record or lies inside it removed — CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR and
# RICHOS_WORKSPACES_DIR included whenever they point there, so the engine's own
# defaults (<HOME>/.claude, <config>/state/workspaces) resolve inside the home.
# They are REMOVED, never SET: a unit that moves HOME or CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR into
# a world of its own expects the other names to follow from its choice, and an
# exported RICHOS_WORKSPACES_DIR overrode that for scratch-reaper.test.sh S30
# on this change's first proof run (its session records went unread).
# Nothing else on the machine writes into that home, so the diff is exactly the
# unit's own writes: a unit that WOULD have written the operator's record
# writes this one instead, and is still red.
#
# The throwaway home is CI's shape, measured against engine-self-verify.yml: no
# record at all, and a git identity (the workflow declares one because fixtures
# commit). Nothing of the operator's own home is carried in; in particular not
# the operator's git configuration, which is read from $HOME.
#
# The home lies inside the runner's temp directory. A unit that makes a claim
# about the account's REAL home reads it from the password database, as
# disk-watchdog.test.sh W22d does: judged against the throwaway home, the
# declared $TMPDIR is "a folder holding the home" — a verdict about the runner.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT SEE NOW, named: a unit that reaches the operator's record by a
# path fixed BEFORE it started (an absolute path baked into a script) or from
# the password database (pwd.getpwuid) rather than $HOME. Measured 2026-09-27:
# the engine's only two getpwuid readers (cpu_guard.py hook(), probe Q7) use it
# to DECLINE real state when HOME is redirected, never to write it.
#
# A PATH IT CANNOT READ IS A FAILURE, NEVER A QUIET PASS. RC_HEALTHY carries
# it, exactly as LC_HEALTHY does for the leak canary.
#
# Safe to source repeatedly. Never writes anything under <config>.
