"""operator_fences_admin.py: `operator-fences.sh install|on|off|status|uninstall`.

ONE INSTALLER OWNS THE CHAIN (spec r3 e8; Frank §3). `install` writes the
launcher as <common>/hooks/reference-transaction in each repository and moves
whatever hook was there into reference-transaction.d/, where the launcher runs
it on every transaction, refused ones included:

    reference-transaction.d/20-ref-transaction-forensics.sh   the recorder
    reference-transaction.d/50-repository-hook                  any other hook

`install-ref-forensics.sh` and femcboost's `.githooks/install.sh` learn the
launcher and write into those two slots instead of over it.

THE SWITCH LIVES IN THE LAUNCHERS (Frank G12). `on` and `off` rewrite one line
in each launcher this command owns; nothing in any repository's working tree is
touched, so an emergency `off` needs no lease and leaves every repository as
clean as it found it. The entity's orchestration.config line OPERATOR_FENCES is
the DECLARATION: `on` refuses unless it says "on", and `status` (and the
integrity probe through it) reports any disagreement.

THE LEASE HOME IS BAKED IN (Frank G10). The installer resolves the home and
the per-repository key with workspaces.py's own land_lock_path() and writes
both into the launcher, which is the only place the fence reads them from.

NOT DONE HERE, on purpose: ~/.codex/AGENTS.md is never edited by this command.
r3 e1 had the installer write a Codex block there; the brief for this build put
that text in the handoff for Rich to apply by hand, because it changes how the
CEO's Codex works. See the as-built record.
