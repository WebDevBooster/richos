"""build_caches.py: the build output RichOS keeps on the external drive, and when it is garbage.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-10-08). /Volumes/E1TB was 98% full, three weeks after it was added:
930 of 954 GB used, 824 GB of it under caches/. Measured that morning:

  cargo-target/workspaces              183 GB  one folder per checkout that ever ran Cargo
  cargo-target/shared-build-v1         121 GB  dependency units every checkout shares
  cargo-target/{richos-app,...}/       175 GB  three more Cargo trees, each with both of the above
  cargo-target/{debug,release}          44 GB  a Cargo tree from builds without the wrapper
  richos-native-ios{,-proof,-ui}       142 GB  one folder per checkout that ran an iOS build
  richos-native-android                 30 GB  one folder per checkout that ran an Android build
  richos-claude-quota                   12 GB  a Cargo tree last built on 2026-09-25

NOTHING EVER REMOVED ANY OF IT. Each tool keys its folder by a hash of the checkout's path
(lib/cargo_identity.py, bin/rios, bin/randroid, the native test scripts), so a checkout that is
landed and deleted leaves its folder behind with nothing pointing at it, forever. And Cargo
never deletes a dependency unit it no longer uses: every version bump, feature change and
toolchain update adds a unit and keeps the old one. The scratch reaper covered temp folders,
never these caches.

TWO RULES, BOTH TAKEN BY THE SCHEDULED SWEEP (scratch-reaper.py scan_build_caches):

  1. A FOLDER KEYED TO A CHECKOUT THAT NO LONGER EXISTS is deleted. The key is recomputed
     here from every live checkout exactly as each tool computes it; a folder whose key no
     live checkout produces is an orphan. It is kept while anything inside it was written or
     read within SCRATCH_BUILD_CACHE_ORPHAN_HOURS (a copy of a checkout outside git, a test
     fixture building right now) or while a Cargo build holds its lock.

  2. A CARGO UNIT NO BUILD HAS READ FOR SCRATCH_BUILD_CACHE_IDLE_HOURS is deleted. Cargo reads
     every unit's fingerprint at every build that depends on it, so a unit's last access time
     is the last time any build needed it (measured on this drive: atime is updated). A unit
     that is deleted and needed again is rebuilt by Cargo, which checks that its outputs
     exist. The profile directory's Cargo lock is held for the deletion, so no build runs
     while its units are being removed, and a build that holds it keeps all of them.

THE LANDER TAKES A WORKSPACE'S OWN FOLDERS AT THE MOMENT IT IS DELETED (owned_paths, used by
mega-lander/workspaces.py), so rule 1 only catches what that missed: a crashed agent, a
workspace removed some other way, and everything from before 2026-10-08.

NO SIZE CAP ANYWHERE. What stays is what is in use or was used recently.
