"""blocking_ask.py: THE LEAD MUST NOT GO DEAF WHILE IT WAITS FOR THE CEO.

Item B of richos-hq docs/operations/2026-10-01-escalation-wakes-the-lead.md,
built past Sage's review of it (richos-hq 8ba32b71, items 8 and 9).

===========================================================================
THE FAILURE
===========================================================================
2026-10-01, 13:02:02Z: the lead put a question to the CEO with AskUserQuestion.
The tool holds the lead's turn open until he answers, and every task
notification and monitor event waits in the queue behind it: the R1 merge
result (13:02:48Z) and isaac-opus-d3c's final report (13:09:19Z) reached the
lead only at 13:39:01Z, when he came back. For 37 minutes nothing could wake
it: not a teammate finishing, not the stall watcher, not the 93% quota rule.

===========================================================================
TWO HALVES, ONE FILE
===========================================================================
  check       the PreToolUse half (guard-ceo-ruled-ask.sh, the deaf-lead
              check). While a teammate of this session is live, an
              AskUserQuestion is refused and the lead is told to end its turn
              with the question as its FINAL MESSAGE, under the fixed lead-in
              `QUESTION FOR YOU:`. He reads the same words in the terminal, his
              answer arrives as his next prompt, and meanwhile the lead can be
              woken. It is ALLOWED, with nothing to declare:
                - with no live teammate of this session (nothing to be deaf to);
                - when this turn was already refused at Stop. A blocking Stop
                  gate (guard-resource-waits.sh, which "CLEARS ONLY WHEN THE
                  WAIT ENDS") would otherwise keep pushing the turn on, the
                  question would stop being the final message, and the lead
                  could neither block on it nor leave it on screen (Sage 8);
                - when liveness cannot be read (fail open, as the rest of this
                  guard does: a gate that can wedge every question to the CEO
                  is worse than the failure it prevents);
                - after a declaration for this session, with a reason:
                  blocking-ask-exempt.sh (the ceo-ruled-exempt.sh shape: the
                  only text of an AskUserQuestion is what the CEO reads, so a
                  marker line inside it would be put in front of him).
              Teammates the registry does not know (55 of 166 escalations
              since 2026-09-24 had no registry match) are invisible here, so
              the ask is allowed for them: the safe direction, stated so
              nobody reads this as complete coverage.

  unanswered  the Stop half (notice-unanswered-question.sh). The final-message
              route has one cost AskUserQuestion did not: the question
              scrolls away under every later turn the lead is woken for, and
              he comes back to the newest notification, not to the question
              (Sage 9). So while a question put under `QUESTION FOR YOU:` in an
              earlier turn has no later human prompt, it is repeated in the
              Stop systemMessage at every turn end. That channel is shown to
              the PERSON and never to the model (measured, escalations.py), so
              it re-surfaces the question without waking anything.

The lead-in is matched mechanically, never by a prose classifier.
