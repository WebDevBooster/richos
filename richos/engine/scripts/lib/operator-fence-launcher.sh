#
# A repository's `reference-transaction` hook, written by
# <engine>/scripts/operator-fences.sh install from the template at
# <engine>/scripts/lib/operator-fence-launcher.sh. Do not edit it by hand: every
# OPERATOR_FENCES_* value below is rewritten by that command, and
# `operator-fences.sh status` compares this file with the engine and with the
# entity's declaration.
#
# WHAT IT DOES, IN ORDER (spec r3 e2 and e8, Frank G1, G12):
#   1. With OPERATOR_FENCES_STATE="on" only: when the transaction names
#      refs/heads/main, or names HEAD, ORIG_HEAD, CHERRY_PICK_HEAD or REVERT_HEAD
#      inside the MAIN checkout, it runs the fence (operator-fences/operator_fences.py,
#      a copy of the engine's). In `prepared` the fence refuses a move of main,
#      ORIG_HEAD in the main checkout, or switching the main checkout away from
#      main, unless the writer holds the land lease. In `committed` it only
#      records who started a merge, cherry-pick or revert.
#   2. Always, whatever the state and whatever the fence decided: every
#      executable in reference-transaction.d/, in name order, gets the same
#      arguments and the same lines. That is the forensic recorder and the
#      repository's own previous hook. A refused transaction is still recorded.
#   3. Exits 1 if the fence refused, else with the chain's status.
#
# WITH THE STATE OFF, THIS FILE CANNOT REFUSE ANYTHING. Step 1 is skipped
# entirely, no interpreter is started, and step 2 is the whole behavior. This
# launcher sits on every ref write in the repository, AUTO_MERGE on every commit
# included, from the day it is installed with the switch off; a defect in it must
# not be able to reach his terminal before the switch is ever turned on (G12).
#
# WITH THE STATE ON, A FENCE THAT CANNOT DECIDE REFUSES, and the refusal names the
# way out (spec e8): Rich runs `<engine>/scripts/operator-fences.sh off`.
