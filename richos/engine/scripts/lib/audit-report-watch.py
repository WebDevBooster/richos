"""audit-report-watch.py - AN AUDIT REPORT THAT CHANGES AFTER ITS FIXES WERE
BRIEFED REACHES THE LEAD, BY ID.

THE FAILURE (2026-09-30). Codex rewrote two hunt reports after the fix briefs
had been written from the earlier versions: part 1 in richos-hq bf59c54b and
part 5 in 800a9969. The rewrites added findings (part 1: 40, 44, 46; part 5:
P5-36, P5-60, P5-61). Nothing told the lead, so six severity 1 findings sat
unfixed until a count found them. The report was updated; the people fixing
from it were not.

THE MECHANISM. A sweep, not a commit hook, because the rewrite came from a
different agent in a different repository, and a hook in one repository's
.git is invisible to the engine and to every other committer. The sweep keeps,
per report, the finding IDs and a hash of each finding's text as last seen.
Each run compares the report at the record repository's HEAD with that memory.
A finding that is new, or whose text changed, raises ONE escalation through
escalate.sh naming the report, the commit that last touched it and the IDs.
The escalation then reaches the lead through the path every escalation takes
(scripts/hooks/notice-escalations.sh, at every turn end, in the lead's own
context). notice-escalations.sh runs this sweep just before it reads the ledger.

ORDER MATTERS. The escalation is raised first and the memory is written
second, so a raise that fails is retried at the next turn end instead of being
lost. A crash between the two costs one duplicate escalation, never a silent one.

THE FIRST SIGHTING OF A REPORT IS A BASELINE AND SAYS NOTHING. Announcing
every finding of every existing report the day this ships would be noise
that teaches the lead to skip the line. A report first seen later than the
baseline run, with findings, is announced whole: that is new work to fix.

A FINDING is a markdown heading of level 2-4 that begins with an ID: digits
("## 40. Title") or a prefixed ID ("### P5-36: Title"). Its text is everything
up to the next heading of the same or a higher level.

Exit 0: swept (raised or quiet). Exit 2: could not sweep; the reason is on
stderr, and the caller says so audibly.
