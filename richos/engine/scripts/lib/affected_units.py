# The hold-leak merge (34c54f9f4) changed one hook's timeout from 5 to 86400 in hooks/hooks.json
# and in .claude/settings.local.json. Those two lines alone selected 54 and 29 engine units: a
# timeout is a field of a registration, so the event counted as changed and every inventory
# reader of PreToolUse was selected with all its sections, and every suite whose text names
# settings.local.json was selected by basename. No selected suite read the real value (richos-hq
# docs/operations/2026-10-04-merge-check-speed.md, section 1). So when the ONLY difference
# between the two documents is the `timeout` of one or more registrations (same commands,
# matchers, events, order and every other field), the change selects what the changed commands
# themselves select (their sibling suites and the suites that name them) and the suites that
# declare they read hook timeouts with this line of their own:
