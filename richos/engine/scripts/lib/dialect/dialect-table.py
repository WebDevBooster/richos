"""dialect-table.py - generate the British-to-American spelling table from pinned VarCon data.

    dialect-table.py              regenerate dialect-en-US.generated.dict in place
    dialect-table.py --check      exit 1 when the committed table differs from a fresh generation
    dialect-table.py --stdout     print the generated table instead of writing it
    dialect-table.py --report     print how the table was assembled, with every count
    dialect-table.py --deny-lists one-time check: run the engine's named-person and publication
                                  write guards over the generated table (prints verdicts only)

Exit: 0 done; 1 a check failed or an input was refused; 2 usage error or an unreadable or
changed pinned input.

WHY A GENERATED TABLE (step 0 of the American spelling auto-fix, 2026-09-27). The CEO's goal:
"a guard that is as fast as possible and eliminates the need for slow inference as much as
possible". A fixed British-to-American lookup is milliseconds; the work is deciding which pairs
are safe to apply without looking at context, and VarCon already records that. The method is
Clark's, measured in richos-hq docs/research/2026-09-27-american-spelling-autofix.md ("How the
safe and ambiguous sets are produced"), and this file reproduces its varcon_split.py rules
exactly, then applies the RichOS lists:

  1. CANDIDATES. Every form VarCon tags B (British "ise" spelling) at any variant level except
     x (improper) on a line that also has a preferred American form (tag A, no variant mark).
     Possessives and multi-word forms are dropped; the base word covers them.
  2. AMBIGUOUS, and never emitted: the form is a PREFERRED American spelling in some sense
     (tag A or A. anywhere in VarCon), or it maps to more than one American form. Those words
     are correct American where they stand, so leaving them is the right default.
  3. VERIFIED ONLY, SCOWL LEVEL 70 OR BELOW. A form that appears in any unverified cluster is
     out: the unverified clusters hold nonsense pairs that an automatic fix must never apply.
     Forms American dictionaries merely tolerate as variants (tags Av, AV, A-) are IN, by the
     one product rule "always the preferred American form".
  4. LOWERCASE KEYS ONLY. Capitalized VarCon entries are names; a reader re-cases on its own.
  5. THE RICHOS LISTS, beside this file and in ../:
       dialect-en-US.leave.tsv       removals (the Harper review list's leave column, names,
                                     editorial calls); each must remove something
       dialect-en-US.overrides.dict  additions VarCon's verified data lacks
       ../dialect-en-US.dict         the hand-kept dictionary guard-dialect.sh reads today;
                                     every line of it is carried, with its per-file-type options

Every disagreement between those lists and VarCon is REFUSED rather than resolved here: a
generator that quietly picked a winner would be the second vocabulary the engine forbids.

THE OUTPUT FORMAT is the one guard-dialect.sh already parses, so both readers can use it:

    <lowercase British form><TAB><American form>[<TAB>ext-exempt=css,...]

Comment lines start with '#'. The engine hook reads it with python3 at run time; the RichOS app
compiles it in with include_str! at build time (the precedent is richos-voice's model pins).
The file is the product; this script only makes it again, identically, from pinned bytes.

This file carries no word the table would change, so no dialect exemption is needed for it;
dialect-table.test.py proves that on every run.
