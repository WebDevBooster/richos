"""review_delivery.py: A SECOND-REVIEW VERDICT REACHES THE RUNNING TEAMMATE, ONCE.

Ruling §113 (2026-10-08): "A regular RichOS user can never be expected anything
even remotely close to that. So, this all must be completely automated." Slice 3
of richos-hq docs/plans/2026-10-09-automatic-second-review-and-t3-ideas.md
(§2.5, "Changes requested, mid-job": "Delivered to the running teammate once, at
its next tool call, by a hook (no mailbox). The lead is told; nothing is
stopped.") review-watch starts a mid-job review of a long or quiet job and tells
the lead; this tells the teammate whose work it is.

It is the body of scripts/hooks/deliver-review-verdict.sh, a matcherless
PreToolUse hook. For a call made inside a teammate (the payload carries
agent_id), every verdict in second-review's ledger (<state>/reviews.jsonl) on
that teammate's work (its own record, or one it continues) that finished after
that work was registered (the continued record's registration for a verdict on
continued work), and was not yet delivered to this teammate, is printed as
additionalContext, which reaches the teammate's model with that call. "Once" is
a marker file per teammate and review, created exclusively, so two calls made
at the same moment cannot both deliver it.

It never blocks, never stops, edits or messages anything: every outcome is exit 0.
A verdict waits for the teammate's next call however long that takes: which
verdicts are still owed is decided by registration and the delivery markers,
never by age. The lead's own calls cost no interpreter, and a teammate's call
while the ledger holds no verdict on any teammate's work costs one read of it;
the workspace registry is loaded only when one could be this teammate's.

Test seams (second-review-land.test.sh, the class
SecondReview_AMidJobVerdictReachesTheRunningTeammate of
mega-lander/tests/workspaces.test.py): SECOND_REVIEW_STATE_DIR (the ledger),
REVIEW_WATCH_STATE_DIR (the markers), RICHOS_WORKSPACES_DIR (the registry).
