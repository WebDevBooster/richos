every threshold arrives in the environment already declared. The header on that
file carries the reasoning; this one carries the mechanism.

WHY ONE PROGRAM AND NOT A PIPELINE OF SHELL STEPS: the state file is a
read-modify-write. It holds the previous reading (which the drop arithmetic
subtracts from) and the time each notification level was last sent (which makes
"once a day" possible for a job that has no memory between runs). Split across

    # Codex's temporary files, and one stale figure. Four different responses —
    # fix it, ignore it, run this command, and nothing — presented as one alarm.

    #   (a) OUR garbage that FAILED to delete, and test instances that would not
    #       close: §54's "the clean-up failed" branch. MASSIVE ALERT, exit 1,

    #       its retention, a running throwaway container. A person acts, but
    #       nothing is broken and nothing is at risk. Its own heading, with the
    #       exact command, and no alarm.
    #   (c) ANOTHER PROGRAM'S or the operating system's temp. Counted so it is
    #       visible; never ours to touch. One quiet line. No alarm, ever.
