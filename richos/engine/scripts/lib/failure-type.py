failure-type.py — WHEN HE PUTS "TYPE" AND "FAILURE" TOGETHER, THE ANSWER COMES
                  FROM THE FAILURE REGISTER, BY NUMBER, AND IS RECORDED.

The analysis half of two hooks:

    scripts/hooks/failure-type-lookup.sh        UserPromptSubmit   `inject`
    scripts/hooks/guard-failure-type-answer.sh  Stop, BLOCKING     `stop`

===========================================================================
THE RULE, AND WHOSE IT IS
===========================================================================
The operator asked, in capitals, what must ALWAYS happen whenever he mentions
the words "type" and "failure" close to each other, and when that would start
happening with guaranteed reliability. It had been promised the same morning,
in a sentence, and broken the same day, because a sentence is not a mechanism.
The rule this file enforces:

    1. The lead READS the register (the type catalog) before answering.
    2. The reply NAMES each matching type as `Type <N>: <its heading,
       verbatim>`, where N exists in the register; or says it is a new type.
    3. The instance is RECORDED in the register and COMMITTED, in the same
       turn: a new type as the next free number, a repeat as a
       `### 5.<n> Type <N>, again` entry.

The register's location is DECLARED, never guessed: `FAILURE_TYPE_REGISTER` in
the entity's orchestration.config, absolute or relative to the entity root.

===========================================================================
WHAT THIS READS OF HIS WORDS, AND WHY THAT IS NOT INFERRING WHAT HE MEANT
===========================================================================
This engine's standing ruling is that a hook may check what the lead DID and
never decides what the operator MEANT. This file reads his message for two
WORDS, because the trigger is his own and he stated it in terms of words: "the
words TYPE and FAILURE close to each other". Nothing here classifies intent,
tone or topic. The predicate is lexical and literal: an inflection of *type*
(type, types, typed, typing) and one of *failure* (failure, failures), in
either order, at most WINDOW words apart. Its whole effect is to require a
lookup and a record; it never decides which type applies, which is the one
judgment the gate leaves with the lead and states that it leaves there.

Measured before the window was chosen, over every transcript on the machine
the rule was written on (2026-09-26): 2,645 messages whose origin is the
operator, 36 containing both words, and in all 36 the words are one or two
apart. Every window from two upward selects the same 36; six is headroom for
phrasings not yet seen, not a fitted number. The corpus beside the suite is
synthetic (the engine is public); his real lines are in the private record.

HIS TEXT ONLY. The words in a hook's output, a tool result, the lead's own
reply, a teammate's message, another session's message, a task notification or
pasted material never trigger anything. At UserPromptSubmit the payload holds
only the text, so machine envelopes are stripped by shape (the list below). At
Stop the transcript holds each record's `origin`, and the predicate is the one
scripts/lib/left-off.py derived and measured for "which messages are his",
imported rather than copied.

===========================================================================
THE STOP GATE — THREE CHECKS, EACH READ FROM AN ARTIFACT
===========================================================================
  (a) READ       a Read or Grep of the register, or a Bash command that runs a
                 reader (cat, grep, sed, awk, head, tail, python...) naming it,
                 in THIS turn's tool traffic, whose result is not an error. Any
                 copy of the register counts (a worktree holds one).
  (b) NAMED      the reply (every assistant text block of the turn, plus the
                 final message from the payload) contains `Type <N>` followed by
                 that type's heading, verbatim up to formatting (bold, backticks,
                 line breaks, a final period), for an N the register has. Or it
                 says "new type" AND (c) found a `Type <M>:` heading ADDED this
                 turn. A number alone is not enough: a heading copied out of the
                 register is the evidence that the register, not recall,
                 answered.
  (c) COMMITTED  a commit in the register's repository, on ANY ref, whose
                 committer time is at or after the turn's first record, and
                 which changes the register file.

"The turn" is scoped by prompt_id, the way turn-manifest.py scopes it: from the
first record carrying the payload's prompt_id to the end of the file.

===========================================================================
IT DOES NOT STAND DOWN ON THE RE-FIRE, AND THAT IS A DELIBERATE EXCEPTION
===========================================================================
Most Stop guards in this engine return 0 when `stop_hook_active` is true, so
each refuses a turn at most once. That is a pattern, not a rule:
guard-workspace-gate.sh keeps refusing. This gate keeps refusing too, because
each of its three steps is something the lead can do inside the same turn, in
under a minute. The bound is the host's: after CLAUDE_CODE_STOP_HOOK_BLOCK_CAP
consecutive refusals (default 8, read from the 2.1.283 binary) the host ends the
turn itself.

AND WHEN THE HOST DOES END IT, THE DEBT IS NOT FORGIVEN. An unpaid obligation
is written to the entity's state and carried into the NEXT turn, which is
refused for it whatever his next message says, until a turn reads, names and
commits. That is the answer to "the cap makes it less than 100%": the cap can
end a turn, it cannot make the record stop being owed.

===========================================================================
WHAT IT CANNOT GUARANTEE — stated so it is never read as more
===========================================================================
  * That the type named is the RIGHT type. That is judgment; the gate checks
    that a real type was named from the register and a record was committed.
  * That the commit records THIS instance. It checks that the register changed
    in a commit made during the turn, not what the change says.
  * A second session committing to the same register during the same turn
    would satisfy (c) for both.
  * Hooks load at session start: nothing here acts in a session that began
    before it was installed.

Usage:
    failure-type.py inject            UserPromptSubmit payload on stdin
    failure-type.py stop              Stop payload on stdin
    failure-type.py classify          one message per line on stdin -> 0/1 lines
    failure-type.py classify-json     one JSON string on stdin -> 0/1
    failure-type.py classify-corpus F  a private corpus (JSON lines with
                                       "text" and "want") -> summary, exit 1 on
                                       any disagreement

Environment (set by the wrappers):
    RICHOS_FT_ENTITY_ROOT   the governed repository
    RICHOS_FT_REGISTER      FAILURE_TYPE_REGISTER as declared (may be empty)
    RICHOS_FT_STOOD_DOWN    1 when CHECK_FAILURE_TYPE=0
