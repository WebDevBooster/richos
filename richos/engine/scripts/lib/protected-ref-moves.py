"""protected-ref-moves.py — THE READER FOR A CHECK THAT STOPPED WRITING.

===========================================================================
WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
===========================================================================
On 2026-09-14 `_restore_protected_refs` in scripts/lib/workspaces.py stopped
moving a protected ref back. It had moved `refs/heads/main` in /Users/alex/ab/
richos three times in one night — the second and third twelve seconds apart, in
opposite directions, while the lead was landing (docs/verification/
ref-write-forensics-2026-09-14.md; re-derived from the store's own event log:
three `protected-ref-restored` rows, at 22:41:29Z, 00:09:14Z and 00:09:26Z).
The check cannot tell the lead's ordinary land from the abuse it hunts, so it
now REPORTS a move and leaves the ref alone.

That trade was raised by the engineer who made it, in his own words: *"who
reads that notice is not mine to decide."* It is the right trade and it opened
a real gap, because of where the report went. Measured, not assumed:

  1. a row in the store's event log      nothing reads it   (no hook, no
     (`protected-ref-moved`)             script, no gate — grepped)
  2. a row on the agent's own record     nothing surfaces it
  3. a `=== PROTECTED REF MOVED ... ===` stderr of a PostToolUse hook that
     line from observe-created-refs.sh   exits 0 — the transcript, never the
                                         operator's scroll (the measured
                                         channel table in
                                         scripts/lib/stop-hook-notice.sh),
                                         and it is printed into the session of
                                         the AGENT THAT MADE THE MOVE, which
                                         is the one party that cannot decide
                                         whether the move was allowed.

So the automatic action was replaced by a notice with no reader. This file is
the reader. It is deliberately NOT a guard: it refuses nothing, blocks nothing
and writes to no repository. The check stopped writing because its inference
was wrong; a blocking version of the same inference would be the same defect
wearing a heavier coat.

===========================================================================
THE PREDICATE — ONE MECHANICAL QUESTION, ASKED LATER
===========================================================================
    IS THE TIP THE BRANCH HELD WHEN THE AGENT'S CALL STARTED STILL ON THE
    BRANCH?

That is the whole rule. It has no threshold, no heuristic and no opinion about
who moved anything, and it answers the only question a person actually has to
decide about: WERE COMMITS LOST.

  * `git merge-base --is-ancestor <snapshot tip> <branch now>` succeeds
    -> HEALED. Everything that was on the branch is still on it. This is the
    lead's ordinary land, the agent's doorway merge that was then landed, a
    deletion that was re-created — every benign shape collapses here and is
    never mentioned. It is also what the three real 2026-09-13/14 incidents
    look like today, because a human recovered them.
  * it fails -> OPEN. Commits that were on a protected branch are not on it
    any more. Nothing about that is ambiguous and nothing about it self-heals.
  * it cannot be asked (the repository, the branch or the object is gone)
    -> UNDECIDABLE, and an undecidable finding is announced exactly as loudly
    as an open one. Absence is never evidence, and INDETERMINATE is never
    collapsed into either answer.

WHY THE CHECK ITSELF CANNOT ASK THIS. `_restore_protected_refs` runs at a
PostToolUse, in the middle of a land, with one agent's minutes-stale snapshot
and no idea what the next ten seconds hold. At that instant "main moved" and
"commits were lost" are indistinguishable — the reproduction's two modes have
the identical shape and opposite consequences. At REST, after the turn, they
are two different facts and one `is-ancestor` separates them. The split is the
point: the check observes, the reader decides, and neither guesses.

===========================================================================
WHAT CLOSES A FINDING
===========================================================================
Two things, and the first is why this does not become wallpaper:

  * THE TREE HEALS ITSELF. The commits come back — by a merge, a reset, a
    cherry-pick, anything — and the finding is silent from the next turn on,
    with nobody told to close it. Most findings will end this way.
  * THE PERSON SETTLES IT. Rewinding a recorded branch to drop a bad land is a
    legitimate act and it loses commits on purpose, so it must be closable by
    saying so:

        protected-ref-moves.py review --repo <r> --branch <b> --tip <sha>
                                      --why "<why this loss was intended>"

    which appends one `protected-ref-move-reviewed` row to the SAME event log,
    through workspaces.py's own `event()`. One writer, one substrate, no
    sidecar ledger: two ledgers written by one writer and read by nobody is how
    the waiver count on this machine reached 251.

`--why` is required and is not allowed to be blank. A settlement with no reason
is a mute button, and a mute button on the last surviving notice over a ref
that only the lead may move is how this mechanism dies quietly — which is the
one outcome the CEO named when he asked for an owner.

===========================================================================
WHAT IT NEVER DOES
===========================================================================
  * It never writes a ref, never moves one back, and never runs a git command
    that mutates anything. Every git call here is a read.
  * It never edits, closes or re-stamps a row it did not write this run.
  * It never decides that a loss was acceptable. It decides whether commits
    are missing, which is a fact, and says so until a person answers it.

===========================================================================
COMMANDS
===========================================================================
    protected-ref-moves.py hook-summary   three lines for the Stop hook:
                                          state key / count / one sentence
    protected-ref-moves.py list           one readable block per finding
    protected-ref-moves.py review ...     settle one finding, with a reason

Exit codes: 0 clear, 1 findings outstanding, 2 the predicate could not run.
A caller that cannot tell 2 from 0 is a caller that reads an absent reader as a
clean report, so 2 is never returned quietly.
