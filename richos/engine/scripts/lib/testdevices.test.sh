# 2026-09-22: three iOS simulators booted by killed test runs outlived their
# agents and the session. The cases are in testdevices.test.py; this file only
# allocates the sandbox with the engine's own allocator, so a cleanup suite is
# never the thing that leaves garbage, and releases it however the run ends.
# Simulators here are rows in a fake simctl; the machine's own are never read.

# Exit 0 = every case passed; exit 1 = at least one failed.
