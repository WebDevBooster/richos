"""resource_waits.py — NO JOB WAITS ON A SHARED RESOURCE FOR MORE THAN TEN MINUTES
                       WITHOUT THE LEAD BEING STOPPED AT TURN END.

===========================================================================
WHAT THIS EXISTS FOR
===========================================================================
The CEO, 2026-09-25: "A free Mac is used whole; nothing waits in a line."
The CEO, 2026-09-27, after a day on which jobs waited about six and a half
hours in total for the single test VM: "do I want the work to be BLOCKED AND
PISSED AWAY like this because the current worker might need the VM for a
5-second-long fart? Do I want HOURS OF DEVELOPMENT TIME TO BE PISSED AWAY FOR
EVERY 5-SECOND FART???" and then "how many more times will this exact
fuckshit keep repeating itself?"

The rule was written down on the 25th and it had no mechanism. On the 27th
three escalations, each raised after a 90-minute wait for the VM, were each
answered "keep waiting" within a minute (esc-20260927T135514Z-79cdca76,
esc-20260927T161022Z-59234edf, esc-20260927T170831Z-b7177ad3 in the ledger).
A disposition closed each demand and the wait went on. A rule enforced by
attention lasts exactly as long as the attention.

So this is a Stop gate on the lead: while any job has waited more than
RESOURCE_WAIT_MINUTES (10) on a shared resource, the lead's turn does not end.
The refusal names the waiter, what it waits for, who holds the resource, and
whether the holder is actually using it right now. IT CLEARS ONLY WHEN THE WAIT
ENDS. There is no acknowledgement, no disposition and no marker line that
clears it: "keep waiting" is exactly the answer the CEO asked to make
impossible.

===========================================================================
THE TWO SOURCES OF A WAIT, AND WHAT ENDS EACH
===========================================================================
A WAIT IS RECORDED, NEVER INFERRED. An earlier draft also read slot-queue
callers out of the process table by their script names; the lead ruled it out
(esc-20260927T192047Z-fb31d4e2): guessing waiters from process names is the
matched-process pattern the working rules forbid, and it breaks on any rename.
The waiter says it is waiting, through `waiting()`, or it is not counted.

1. WAIT RECORDS — `~/.richos-waits/<pid>-<token>.json` (RICHOS_WAITS_DIR).
   A process that waits on a shared resource writes one while it waits, with
   `waiting()` below, and removes it when the wait is over. Written by the CPU
   admission loop (app/scripts/testvm/reserve.py `cpu_admission`, which
   run-walk.py and every `reserve.py --wait` go through), by proof-run.py when
   it has nothing of its own running and admission refuses the next check, and
   by the test VM's slot queue (app/scripts/testvm/slots.py `guest_slot`, which
   `slots.py run --wait` and run-walk.py go through).
   `resource_waits.py wait --until-exists PATH` records a hand-rolled wait for
   a file (the lead's `vm-queue/<name>-go` protocol) the same way.
   ENDS: the record is removed, or its process is gone (a dead pid, or a pid
   reused by a process that started after the wait did).

2. THE ESCALATION LEDGER — an Escalation whose title, question or meanwhile
   says the teammate is WAITING for a shared resource (the VM, a guest, a
   go-file, a slot, CPU admission). Its wait began when it was raised, minus
   the minutes it says it has already waited ("has waited 90 min", "waiting
   since 12:23Z"). Repeated escalations for one wait are one wait.
   An EscalationAck NEVER ends it. That is the whole point.
   ENDS: the go-file it names exists; its worktree no longer exists; or the
   waiter records the end itself with `resource_waits.py wait-over <id> --note
   "<what ended the wait>"`, which refuses a note that says to keep waiting.

===========================================================================
WHO HOLDS IT, AND IS THE HOLDER USING IT
===========================================================================
TEST VM. Holders are read from the slot files' own holder records
(`<TESTVM_ROOT>/guest.lock`, `guest-2.lock`: `{"pid", "since", "purpose"}`
while held) and from any wait record whose `holding` names a slot file (a
walk that holds guest.lock while it waits for CPU is a holder that is NOT
using the VM). Whether a run executes is read from `<TESTVM_ROOT>/run/<vm>/`:
a live `vm.pid` is a booted guest, its process CPU is how busy the guest is,
and a `hold-walk.py` among the holder's own descendants (found from the
holder's pid, never by searching for the name) is a guest held open for
hand-driven steps rather than a scripted run. That only changes the WORDS of
the refusal; whether a turn is refused never depends on a process name. The lock files are NEVER probed with flock:
a probe that took the lock for a microsecond could refuse a real walk
(run-walk.py takes the lock without waiting). An older checkout that holds
guest.lock without writing a holder record is reported as such.

CPU ADMISSION. There is no single holder; the refusal names the processes
using the most CPU right now (`ps` %CPU) and the other waits, so the lead can
decide what to stop or reorder.

===========================================================================
COST
===========================================================================
Per turn end: one directory listing, one read of the escalation ledger and a
few stat calls. One `ps` call (37 ms median, measured) is added only when a
wait has reached the threshold: to confirm its pid was not reused and to say
who holds the resource. BUDGET_SECONDS bounds it. The whole hook's cost,
measured, is resource-waits.test.sh's RW36 line.

Exit codes of `stop`:
    0  the turn may end; stdout is one `RW<TAB>kind<TAB>detail` line
    2  REFUSED: a wait is over the threshold; the refusal is on stderr
    3  this file could not evaluate
