"""Run native builds with one machine worker, one shared native build lane and
explicit compiler/JVM caps. A healthy external circuit breaker is required on Mac.
No environment variable exempts a caller from admission.

HOW MANY CORES (2026-10-02). From September 24 every native build ran on one core
(one Gradle worker, one Swift/Xcode job, CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1, every JVM told it had one
processor) whatever the Mac had free. The protection that one-core rule was written for
is kept by the rest of this file and the watchdog: one compiler lane, the machine worker
budget, admission below the 80 percent line, and cpu_guard's per-process runaway stop.
A build now gets the cores free at admission below a target that leaves the CEO room:

    cores = max(1, floor(cpus * (target - busy) / 100 / sharers))
    target  = the admission line (80) minus CEO_HEADROOM_PERCENT (20) = 60 percent
    busy    = total CPU (user + system) measured at admission, in percent
    sharers = machine worker permits held at admission, this build's own included

On a 10-core Mac: alone and quiet (busy 5) 5 cores; four workers admitted at once 1
each; busy 40 percent 2 cores; busy 59 percent or more 1 core. The most any build gets
is cpus * 60 / 100 (6 here), so a lone build at its allowance leaves the Mac at about
60 percent, 20 points (2 cores here) below the line where admission closes. An
unmeasured host gets 1. The decision is printed on stderr for every admitted build.

A BUILD IS JUDGED BY ITS GRANT (2026-10-02). native-work registers each admitted build with
the CPU watchdog as a native-build root carrying its grant and its workspace (cpu_guard
NATIVE_ROLE). While the build's whole process tree, plus the workspace's warm Gradle daemon,
stays within the grant, no process in it is held to the watchdog's per-process line
(JOB_CORES, 3 cores for 10 s); above the grant that line applies again, and anything
unregistered keeps it. That line had kept every JVM at one processor: a Gradle JVM given
four ran at 6.08 cores and was stopped (cpu-guard events.jsonl, pid 3022).
  - Gradle gets the grant: its daemon JVM's processors and --max-workers are
    gradle_processors(cores) = cores - JVM_OVERHEAD_CORES (at least 1), because a JVM runs
    about two cores above its processor count in JIT and GC threads (measured 2026-10-02:
    1 processor peaks at 1.2-2.3 cores, 4 at 6.08). Every other JVM (JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: the
    Gradle client, test and worker JVMs) keeps JVM_CORES (1).
  - Cargo keeps at most PROCESS_CORES (2) jobs and release Swift/Xcode compiles 1 job, as
    before (not part of this change). Debug Swift and Xcode builds get the allowance.

GRADLE STAYS WARM WITHIN A JOB (2026-10-02). The first Gradle build in a workspace starts a
daemon in that workspace's private registry; the supervisor releases it at the build's end
instead of ending it, and later builds in the same workspace reuse it. It has Gradle's
2-minute idle timeout and ends when the workspace is landed or discarded. Ownership, CPU
accounting and every way it ends: gradle_daemons.py. RICHOS_GRADLE_DAEMON=0 turns it off
(every Gradle build cold, --no-daemon, as before) and RICHOS_GRADLE_MAX_PROCESSORS=N caps the
daemon's processors; neither changes anything about admission, and neither can raise a grant.
