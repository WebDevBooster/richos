"""stall_watch.py: THE LEAD IS WOKEN THE MOMENT TEAMMATE WORK STALLS.

===========================================================================
WHAT THIS EXISTS FOR
===========================================================================
The CEO, 2026-09-28, after three teammates made no commit for 70 to 85 minutes
while he was away: "everyone is fucking WAITING ALL THE FUCKING TIME AND
NOTHING EVER MOVES FORWARD", "WHY THE FUCK DO I ALWAYS HAVE TO MANAGE ALL THIS
FUCKSHIT??? IS THAT MY FUCKING JOB???" and "WHERE THE FUCK WAS THAT FUCKING
WATCHER BEFORE???". His build points (2026-09-25): "He never has to ask; every
step and failure reaches him unprompted." "A free Mac is used whole; nothing
waits in a line."

What happened: the three were queued behind the Mac's single proof-run slot
(limit 1, one holder, three waiting 32 to 41 minutes) while the Mac sat at 26
to 38% CPU, and one of them (buildguard1) was queued behind its OWN proof run.
Nothing woke the lead: no teammate finished, guard-resource-waits.sh fires only
when the lead ends a turn, and the lead had no turn. A watcher that must be
started by hand is the same defect one step later, so this one is started by
Claude Code itself with every interactive session: the engine's plugin monitor
(monitors/monitors.json), exactly as quota-watch is.

===========================================================================
WHAT IS A STALL (every threshold, and why)
===========================================================================
1. A RESOURCE WAIT OVER 10 MINUTES (RICHOS_RESOURCE_WAIT_MINUTES, the same
   number and the same variable as the turn-end gate, resource_waits.py).
   Read from the records waiters write themselves (resource_waits.py: CPU
   admission, the test VM slot, a go-file, and any other resource a waiter
   names, such as a device), from the escalation ledger's stated waits, and
   from the proof-run slot line itself (app/scripts/lib/proof_slots.py
   status), which says who holds each slot and where each waiter stands.
   A wait is recorded, never inferred from process names.

2. A SILENT TEAMMATE: a live teammate of THIS session (the workspace registry
   says its run has not ended and it is not paused) with no new commit on any
   of its workspaces AND no new write to its transcript for 20 minutes
   (STALL_WATCH_SILENT_MINUTES). Why 20: a working teammate writes its
   transcript at every tool result. The longest honest gap between two is one
   tool call: the Bash tool's ceiling is 600 s (a longer foreground command is
   moved to the background at 600 s and the move is a result), and a teammate
   waiting on a background command runs `agent_hold.py wait`, which returns at
   most every 270 s. So a long honest test run keeps writing the transcript at
   least every ten minutes however long the run itself takes, and twenty is
   twice the longest honest silence. A commit is not required: a teammate that
   is working but has not committed for an hour is not silent.

3. A SELF-WAIT: a teammate process waiting for a proof-run slot or a test VM
   slot that another process of the SAME teammate holds, reported after 2
   minutes (STALL_WATCH_SELF_WAIT_MINUTES): the Mac getting freer never ends
   it, only its own other run ending does. Ownership is read, in order, from
   the process's inherited owner tag (agent_hold.py's RICHOS_AGENT_OWNER,
   captured at spawn), from the registered workspace its recorded working
   directory is in, and from the waiter name the slot library recorded. When
   the holder is the waiter's own ANCESTOR it is a DEADLOCK: a nested run that
   did not borrow its caller's slot, which only the 3-hour timeout ends.

4. A TEAMMATE ESCALATION (2026-10-01; its own section below, ESCALATION). Not a
   stall: a `proceeding` or `work-complete` escalation is a record, and the
   ledger's design depends on never calling it one. It is told here because
   this monitor is the one thing that can start a lead turn: on 2026-10-01 a
   teammate's question that needed the CEO at the test iPhone waited 82
   minutes for a turn that no hook could start. It prints its own
   ESCALATION-WATCH block, first in the look's output.

===========================================================================
HOW OFTEN IT SPEAKS (nothing spams)
===========================================================================
It looks every 60 s (STALL_WATCH_POLL_SECONDS). A stall is announced ONCE when
it is first seen, again only when it has lasted another 30 minutes since the
last notice (STALL_WATCH_REPEAT_MINUTES), and once more, in one line, when it
has been gone for two consecutive looks (one look that misses it is not an end:
a source can fail to read once). Everything due in one look is ONE notification
block. What was announced is kept in its session's state directory, so a
restarted monitor does not repeat itself.

===========================================================================
IT ONLY REPORTS
===========================================================================
It never kills, stops, pauses, signals or messages anything, and it takes no
lock that anything else waits for (the slot library's own status probe is a
shared, non-blocking lock dropped at once). Each notice names the teammate,
what it waits on, who holds it, since when, and what the lead can do. The lead
acts.

===========================================================================
COMMANDS (stall-watch.sh passes --engine-root, --config and --command)
===========================================================================
  --monitor  the plugin monitor's body: runs for the whole session and prints
             each notification block; ends with its session
  --alive    one line: is this session watched, and when did it last look.
             0 watched; 1 nothing is watching (or the watcher stopped
             looking); 2 no session here to check
  --watch    the fallback where plugin monitors do not run: the same loop, run
             as a BACKGROUND command; it exits after the first notification,
             so start it again after each one
  --once     every stall right now, whatever was announced; 0 none, 1 some,
             2 could not look at all. Keeps no state
  --notice   the SessionStart notice body (session-start-stall.sh wraps it)
  --tick     one look against the session's state, printing what the monitor
             would print (the test suite's clock is STALL_WATCH_NOW)

# step cost about 4.5 minutes (a background Bash call, then `agent_hold.py wait`
# returning only at its bound). It wrote its transcript every 4.5 minutes, so the
# SILENT rule (20 minutes) never saw it, and the CEO had to ask.
#
# THE RULE: a live teammate whose last SLOW_STEPS_N tool results each came at
# least SLOW_STEP_SECONDS after the call they answer. The step time is the
# timestamp of the tool_result row minus the timestamp of its tool_use row in
# the teammate's own transcript. A step whose command really ran that long (a
# test run, a build, a phone measurement) is exempt: its command is a
# reserve.py, run-tests.sh, perf, xcodebuild or gradle command, or its output
# says it was still working. A "STILL RUNNING" or "STILL WAITING" from
# `agent_hold.py wait` is never exempt: it is the defect itself.

# predicate, escalations.outstanding) by STATE, never by wording, so no phrasing
# slips past, and prints the ones due in an ESCALATION-WATCH block FIRST in the
# look's output. The printed block is what starts a turn for an idle lead.
#
# WHAT IS DUE, every rule from the design and its review (Sage, richos-hq
# 8ba32b71), and why:
#   FIRST WAKE, once per delivery key, when all of these hold:
#     - raised (or reopened by an expired ack) AFTER this session started.
#       The SessionStart block and the Stop hook own the backlog; a block over
#       the host's 10,000-character cap would otherwise wake the lead at once
#       and then every minute until it drained (Sage 6a).
#     - it has not already reached this session's model
#       (escalations.reached_scan / has_reached over the host transcript: the
#       SessionStart block, a Stop delivery, an earlier monitor event).
#     - it is not owned by ANOTHER live session (twin Rich): suppressed only on
#       exactly one registry record with the row's worktree and teammate name
#       whose session is positively running. Zero matches, several, a dead or
#       unknown owner: told (Sage 4). It is better to wake twice than to miss.
#   TOLD AGAIN while unacknowledged, once it has reached this session's model
#   (by this monitor or by the Stop hook):
#     - needs=ceo-hands: every 10 min (STALL_WATCH_CEO_HANDS_REPEAT_MINUTES).
#       Each minute burns a waiting teammate; d3c gave up after 89.
#     - state=stopped: every 30 min (the stall repeat, STALL_WATCH_REPEAT_MINUTES).
#       A stopped teammate is a stall by the ledger's own definition.
#     - any other: once at each age bucket the ledger defines (1h, 24h, 72h),
#       never on a clock. A `proceeding` escalation is not a stall.
#   An ACKNOWLEDGEMENT ends every repeat SILENTLY: the lead made the ack, so a
#   line about it would be a wake about nothing.
#
# THE BLOCK STAYS UNDER 2,000 CHARACTERS (ESC_BLOCK_CHARS). The largest monitor
# event ever delivered on this Mac was 2,352 characters and nobody has measured
# whether the host cuts a longer one; if it records the text before a cut, the
# transcript would claim a delivery the model never saw (Sage 5). So one line
# per escalation (key, title, from, state, for, needs, the question's start)
# and a pointer to the full text. What does not fit goes in the next look.
#
# A SOURCE THAT CANNOT BE READ changes nothing: the ledger or the transcript
# unreadable is one NOT READ line through the stall machinery, and every
# escalation key is carried forward unchanged, so the next good read does not
# re-announce everything (Sage 6b). Its state is its own (`esc` in this
# session's announced.json); it never reads or writes the Stop hook's memory.
