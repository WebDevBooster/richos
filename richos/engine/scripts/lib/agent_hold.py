"""Hold an agent's running commands when it is paused; continue them on RESUME.

A pause is a message, and a message reaches an agent only at its next tool call,
so the command it is already running keeps the CPU until it ends. This module
makes the pause take effect at once: it suspends (SIGSTOP) exactly the processes
the paused agent owns and continues (SIGCONT) exactly those on RESUME. Nothing is
terminated, so nothing is lost. Measured on Claude Code 2.1.283: a suspended
foreground command that passes its Bash timeout is moved to the background, not
signaled, and finishes normally once continued.

OWNERSHIP IS CAPTURED AT SPAWN, BY THE PROCESS ITSELF. Every Bash call made by a
subagent is rewritten (shell-evidence.py calls rewrite()) to record its shell
through a literal helper call keyed by session, agent and tool call, and to export an
inherited owner tag. A process is owned only when it is alive, still has its
recorded parent and started between the hook and the record's write. A reused PID
fails that test. Names, paths and working directories never choose a process.

THE OWNED TREE is those shells, their descendants, the members of process groups
an owned process leads, and processes carrying this agent's own inherited tag
(detached and reparented children). Never pid 1, never the session process, never
this process or its ancestors. A proc_tree.py supervisor inside the tree IS held
with its check (it registers as a cpu_guard "session" root, which protects it from
cpu_guard's CPU kills, not from a pause): left running, it watched a frozen check
and its bounds expired (Sage's catch 2).

SHARED DAEMONS ARE LEFT RUNNING. A tagged process that was reparented to launchd
and leads its own session is a daemon the agent started for everyone (an adb
server, a Gradle daemon): other agents' work talks to it, so freezing it would
hold their work too. It is named in the report. (Sage's catch 5.)

THE TEST VM GUEST IS LEFT RUNNING. A walk that holds a guest slot (its holder
record is validated against the holder's start time) keeps running with
everything under it, and so does every recorded VM process and the run's login
keeper, which run.sh detaches (so neither is under the walk by parent link).
Freezing them would keep a shared slot locked for the whole pause and fail the
walk's own cleanup. The walk ends by itself and releases its slot; its boot,
push and cleanup steps are bounded (480, 120 and 120 s) but its scenario step is
not, and during a quota pause the guest keeps using the quota until it ends.
(Sage's catches 4 and 7.)

NOTHING STAYS FROZEN AFTER ITS LEAD. Every hold starts a watchdog, a detached
process outside every agent's tree. It releases the hold on its own when every
recorded session process is gone (a lead that crashed without SessionEnd: each
Bash shell is a session leader under `claude`, so the kernel never continues its
stopped group) or when the registry records the agent finished (a stop made from
the CEO's screen, which runs no hook). (Sage's catches 6 and 1.)

A PAUSED AGENT WAITS INSIDE ITS RUN. A background subagent that ends its turn
ends its run, and a later message starts a new run (Rich, brief addition 1). The
generated WAIT therefore tells it to run `agent_hold.py wait`, which returns
RESUMED only once the hold is released.

A HELD AGENT MAKES NO MODEL CALL WHILE IT WAITS (2026-10-04). Every return of a
tool call is a model call that reads the agent's whole context. The wait used to
return STILL WAITING every 270 s to keep the prompt cache warm, and each held
agent re-ran it: on 2026-09-29 fifteen held Fable workers made 44 such calls in
17 minutes, reading 22.0 million context tokens, after the five-hour quota had
switched to the API. Now gate(), run first by the PreToolUse[Bash] rewriter
(shell-evidence.py), holds a held agent's wait call before it starts, for as
long as the hold stands, once that agent has been handed this hold's WAIT
notice; the model is not called until the release lets the call run and print
RESUMED. Measured on Claude Code 2.1.288: a PreToolUse hook held a subagent's
tool call for 700 s with no model call, and a test agent held 5 minutes made
none until its release. The bound is that hook's timeout in hooks.json (86400 s;
not measured beyond 700 s): when it expires the call runs, returns STILL WAITING
once and the next wait is held again.

NATIVE TASKS KEEP THE TOOL ROUND FREE (2026-09-28). The previous foreground
wrapper used trap, $$ and a subshell job. Claude Code 2.1.283 rejects those
constructs for worktree-isolated agents. New calls retain the original command
at top level after a literal helper invocation and owner exports. The helper
records its own parent; it never reads or executes the user's command.

With RICHOS_AGENT_BASH_FOREGROUND=1, ordinary CLI subagent Bash calls get six
seconds to deliver their result in the foreground, then use the harness's
automatic native background handoff. This remains opt-in pending installed
acceptance. SDK callers and explicit background calls keep their existing path.
RICHOS_AGENT_BASH_FOREGROUND=0 restores forced background execution. This is a handoff grace, not a process execution deadline;
the host's own background limits still apply. A directly delivered result needs
no collector call and is marked consumed at the next tool boundary.
The agent waits with this module's foreground `wait` command, which checks for
new holds every half second. A hold freezes the native task's entire owned tree;
the wait returns promptly so the queued WAIT message reaches the agent. The next
wait stays inside the same run until release, returning at most every 270 s to
retain the prompt cache. Native task completion retains the original output and
exit status. The wait binds the exact tool result in this agent's transcript to
the host's output file and returns its output/status, so no extra Read is needed
for ordinary results. A finished call's result is returned as soon as it is
ready, even while another of the agent's calls is still running; that call is
named as not finished and a later wait returns it (2026-10-04: one long test
run held every later wait at its bound, about 4.5 min per step).
A nonzero task makes that wait nonzero too. A missing
native result is explicitly unavailable, never inferred to be successful.

A held agent's new Bash calls are denied by the hook. The mark helper checks the
hold again at execution to close the hook-to-spawn race. Wait calls are exempt
and forced into the foreground. Legacy wrappers already in flight still use
_detach/_collect and keep their frozen results until collected.

KNOWN LIMITS: held work keeps its file locks (the hold report lists the lock
files it has open: a Cargo target lock, a worker token, a git index lock), and a
command started before capture was installed has no record and is not held (and
one started under the previous capture is frozen whole, round included). Timers
inside held work keep counting unless they use proc_tree.HeldClock. A wrapped
foreground command's output reaches the harness when it ends, not line by line,
and stdout and stderr arrive as one stream. Non-Bash tools are not refused while
held; the WAIT reaches the agent at their return anyway.
