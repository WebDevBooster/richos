"""hook-dependencies.py — the predicate behind scripts/lib/hook-dependencies.sh.

Prints one engine-relative path per line: every file under scripts/, mega-lander/ or ass-kicker/ that a
registered hook needs, transitively, and that is not itself a registered hook.

    hook-dependencies.py <engine-dir>

The whole decision — what counts as a reference, why a sentence containing a
path is not one, what the anchor is and why a broken deriver must print nothing
— is stated in hook-dependencies.sh. This file is the implementation of it, kept
separate for the reason ceo-todos.sh keeps ceo-todos.py: one predicate, callable
from shell, with no heredoc inside a command substitution (bash 3.2 on macOS
mis-parses that shape, which is how this file came to exist).

Exit codes, identical to the wrapper's contract:
  0  complete closure printed
  1  no such engine directory, or no hooks/hooks.json in it
  2  hooks/hooks.json unparseable, or registering no hook script at all
  4  ANCHOR FAILED — nothing printed
