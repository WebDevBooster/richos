"""shared_scratchpad.py — a teammate never deletes inside the lead session's directory.

WHAT HAPPENED, 2026-10-01. Claude Code gives every session a scratchpad,
<root>/<project-slug>/<session-id>/scratchpad, and tells every IN-PROCESS teammate
of that session that the same directory is its own "session-specific" scratchpad.
It is shared: the lead and every teammate of the session write into one folder.
The working-material rule then told each teammate to "delete your disposable
scratch before reporting". Two teammates did exactly that, as their last step:

  22:08:59Z  echo-opus-hunta       rm -rf <session>/scratchpad/* && ls -A ... | wc -l
  22:34:19Z  quint-sonnet-huntb4   rm -f <session>/scratchpad/*

The first took the lead's briefs/ folder. The second took a live teammate's helper
scripts, its logs and its backup copy of a source file it had just mutated, 12
seconds after that teammate parked them there. Both obeyed the rule they were
given; the rule pointed them at a directory they did not own. (The land sweep was
suspected first and is innocent: ~/.claude/state/scratch-reaper.log names no path
under the session directory for either land that night.)

THE RULE. A call made inside a subagent (its payload carries `agent_id`) may not
delete anything inside a session directory under a Claude scratch root, nor that
directory, nor any directory above it. Not "anything it did not create": in a
folder every teammate writes into, nothing on disk proves which teammate wrote a
file, so no delete there can be shown to be the deleter's own. Nothing is lost by
refusing: the scratch reaper removes the whole session directory once the session
has ended. A teammate's own scratch is /Volumes/E1TB/tmp/claude/<its-name>/, and
deleting there is not this rule's business. The lead's own calls are not refused.

WHAT IT SEES: rm, rmdir, unlink, trash, srm, and find with -delete or an
-exec/-execdir of one of those, after `VAR=value` assignments made earlier in the
same command are substituted and relative paths are resolved against the working
directory (including a `cd` earlier in the command). IT IS A TEXT CHECK AND IT
LEAKS (a script file, `sh -c "$X"`, a Python rmtree): its job is to stop the
habitual cleanup command, not an adversary. An operand it cannot resolve (a
variable it never saw assigned) is let through. Any error in the check is a pass.

Usage:
  shared_scratchpad.py bash-check < payload.json     exit 2 refused (reason on stderr), else 0
  shared_scratchpad.py verdict <command> [cwd]       prints the refusal or "allowed"; exit 1/0
