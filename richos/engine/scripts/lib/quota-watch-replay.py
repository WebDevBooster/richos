"""Historical quota timelines without wall-clock waits.

Only quota_watch's clock is replaced. Its poll loop, payload parsing, registry,
rule decisions and (R04) subprocess control transport execute unchanged. Real
deadline, polling and registry journeys remain in quota-watch.test.sh.

Since 2026-09-28 the poll loop never stops on an event, so the replay runs ONE
loop for the whole timeline: the simulated lead reads what the loop printed
before each sleep, answers a REFRESH or STALE wake-up by rendering the true
value (its reply re-renders the status line), and the replay ends at the pause
(QUOTA-THRESHOLD) or at the end of the timeline.

# Ruling §108. Seconds after the watcher's poll phase, and the five-hour value.
# r05: 2026-09-29, 15 Fable workers, the lead's transcript (session 30e3850f).
# The watcher's monitor started with the session at 18:28:05Z and polled at
# 18:28:10Z + k * 300 s (its wake came at 18:53:10Z). Readings: 7% at 18:29:11Z,
# 91% at 18:50:15Z, 98% at 18:53:10Z, and 100% at 18:54:16Z (a cap: 100 can be
# reached sooner). Between readings the value is interpolated; after the last
# uncapped one the 91->98 rise goes on, which reaches 100 at about 18:54:00Z,
# before the 18:54:16Z read. The window reset at 21:50:00Z. R05 also shifts the
# watcher's poll phase through every 30 s of its cycle (PHASES): where the
# polls happened to fall that evening is luck, and the rule must not need it.
# r07: the fastest normal rise in every logged pair of polls, 2026-09-26
# 07:04:46Z 6% to 07:10:01Z 10% (4 points in 315 s, session c11805a4), started
# at 80% so that it crosses 93 (the level is invented, the speed is real).
# r09: the same run had it not slowed at the end: its own measured speed from
# 18:29:11Z to 18:50:15Z (84 points in 1264 s, 3.99 points per minute) held to
# 100%. The recorded run slowed to about 2.4 per minute after 91%, where the
# check alone is enough; at 3.99 the early wake is what holds it.
# r10: usage flat at 20% (21% after 15 minutes) while the suite has just
# registered 10 teammates: the expected rise, nothing measured.
# r11: 80% and flat for 4 minutes, then a JUMP to 7 points a minute (invented:
# 1.75 times the 15-worker run, about 26 such workers).
# r12: a burst at 20 points per 5 minutes (the 15-worker run's speed) from 10%
# to 70%, then back to 3 per 5 minutes (normal work's fastest, 3.8, rounded
# down), crossing 93% at normal speed.
