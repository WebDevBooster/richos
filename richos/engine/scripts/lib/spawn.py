"""spawn.py - STARTING ONE TEAMMATE IS ONE COMMAND THAT EITHER SUCCEEDS OR NAMES
EVERY PROBLEM BEFORE ANYTHING IS CREATED.

The page: docs/plans/worktree-spec-2026-09-11.md. The registry: workspaces.py.
The command: scripts/spawn.sh.

===========================================================================
WHY THIS EXISTS - CEO, 2026-09-13, his third time asking
===========================================================================
  "it was taking you 10 fucking minutes to spin up one fucking agent properly
   at the beginning of the session. how much longer do I fucking have to wait
   for that retarded fuckshit to be fixed once and forever?"

Starting one teammate was FOUR commands plus a hand-authored JSON file, with at
least four independent ways to fail AFTER work had already begun:

  1. create-teammate-worktree.sh <ABSOLUTE-repo> <name>
       - refused a bare repository name                     (one round trip)
       - refused with "no branch is recorded as the one this work integrates
         on", naming a SECOND command to run first          (one round trip)
       - the richos record was STALE: it named dev/workspace-spec, deleted from
         the remote, so it needed --correct                 (one round trip)
  2. a hand-written JSON input file
  3. prepare-agent-spawn.py --file <input.json>  (adds the ack contract, runs
     no guard at all)
  4. the tool call - where the PreToolUse[Agent] guards finally run, so a
     wording mistake in the brief surfaced only at the very end, one refusal
     per attempt.

On one brief, on one night, that cost: two refusals from
guard-brief-verification-scope.sh, one for a reused name, one for an
unrecorded integration branch, one for a relative repository path. Every one
was fixable in seconds. Every one cost a full round trip in front of him.

===========================================================================
WHAT THIS DOES DIFFERENTLY, AND THE ONE IDEA UNDER ALL OF IT
===========================================================================
EVERY REFUSAL IS EVALUATED BEFORE ANYTHING IS CREATED, AND THEY ARE REPORTED
TOGETHER. A brief that breaks three rules is fixed once, not three times.

  1. The integration branch is RESOLVED, and RECORDED when it is absent and
     the answer is not a human's to give - rather than refusing and naming a
     second command. A STALE record (one naming a branch that no longer
     exists) is CORRECTED in place, keeping the body of work's id so agents
     already bound to it move with it. Where the answer genuinely is a human
     decision - the repository is not on its default branch, or this work must
     not reach main yet - it says WHICH decision, in one line, and stops.
     It never guesses one: point 14 is "nothing infers it and nothing guesses
     it", and the deleted first-registration floor is what guessing costs.
  2. The repository is accepted by absolute path AND by bare name where that is
     unambiguous; an ambiguous name is answered with the candidates.
  3. EVERY PreToolUse[Agent] guard is evaluated against the payload, FROM BOTH
     SURFACES - the engine's hooks/hooks.json and the governed repository's
     .claude/settings*.json - and every failure is reported together. Reading
     only the engine's list is the exact hole that cost two refusals that
     night: guard-brief-verification-scope.sh lives in femcboost, not here.
     A matcherless PreToolUse group matches EVERY tool, so it is collected too;
     the stopgap this replaces missed those.
  4. Only then is the workspace created, and the guards are evaluated a SECOND
     time against the real thing - because clause 7a asks a question about a
     workspace that must exist to be answered.
  5. On ANY failure nothing is left behind: before creation there is nothing to
     leave, and after it the workspace, its branch and its registration are
     withdrawn (workspaces.sh withdraw-cc), which frees the name for the retry.
  6. A TEAMMATE MAY HAVE A WORKSPACE IN SEVERAL OTHER REPOSITORIES: --repo is
     given once per repository, and each gets its own registered cc/ workspace
     under the ONE name, with its own `cross-repo-worktree:` line in the
     payload. Point 10 is "All of an agent's workspaces go together"; the
     example in that sentence is two, and the rule is "every workspace and
     branch it has". Until 2026-09-17 this command took ONE --repo, so a
     teammate needing a second repository had to be given a SECOND NAME -
     which made it a second agent, landed separately, and on 2026-09-17 the CEO
     found the stray branch of one (`cc/norm-opus-wireguide1`) left behind by a
     land that named only `norm-opus-wire1`. Nothing else needed widening: the
     registry has always held a list of workspaces, land and discard have
     always deleted every one of them across every repository, clause 4c of
     guard-worktree-isolation.sh has always read EVERY marker line, and
     register_spawn has always required a registration for each.

THE CLAUSE-7 FALSE POSITIVE IS GONE, NOT SPECIAL-CASED. The stopgap
(femcboost/scripts/preflight-agent-spawn.sh, deleted with this) always reported
guard-worktree-isolation.sh as refusing, because a synthetic envelope has no
session_id or tool_use_id and only the host mints those. A check that always
fails protects nothing and teaches its reader to skip it. So workspaces.py
grew `check-spawn`: the SAME code as `register-spawn` with the write removed,
reached only when the platform minted no tool_use_id. See `is_spawn_check`.
