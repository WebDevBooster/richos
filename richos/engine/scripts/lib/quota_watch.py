"""quota_watch.py — the CEO's 93% quota rule, as one reusable reader and watcher.

HIS WORDS ARE THE WHOLE BEHAVIOR (ruling §87, richos-hq/wiki/ceo-decisions.md):

    "quota polling: every 5 minutes from now. And once it crosses the 93%
    threshold: PAUSE subagents. Then resume after quota rest."

HIS UPDATE, 2026-09-25 (ruling §87, and the boundary cases in
richos-hq/docs/plans/claude-five-hour-quota-rule-2026-09-25.md). At or above
the threshold, do NOT pause when the reset is LESS than 20 minutes away;
exactly 20 minutes still pauses. A hold already in place releases inside that
window, keeping the same agent. The same day he dropped the adaptive schedule
he had also given: "Well, I've changed my mind. Let's drop the 30-minute check
nonsense. Keep it consistent at 5 minutes." So polling is 300 s at every
usage level, and the stale bound stays one 300 s poll.

The five-hour policy below is retained. Weekly support is in quota_weekly.py:
all reported windows are printed; at 99% overall weekly use, the shared reset
service consumes a prior user approval or the lead receives the standard pause
message. Weekly holds release only after fresh weekly allowance and an allowing
five-hour verdict. The twenty-minute exception applies only to five-hour quota.

The original five-hour watcher READS the five-hour window,
it POLLS every 300 seconds, and it WAKES THE LEAD at the threshold, at the
hold's release (the reset less than 20 minutes away) and at the reset, with
the exact messages to send. The lead does the pausing and the resuming; this
file never messages, stops or spawns anything.

THE LAST 20 MINUTES, and how it matches the desktop app (Codex, branch
codex/claude-quota-settings, richos-core/src/quota.rs: RESET_EXEMPTION_MS and
its threshold_and_twenty_minute_boundaries test): the exception applies when
0 < resets_at - now < 1200 s. It applies to a stale reading too, because
resets_at does not move inside one window. A window that has ended is
UNKNOWN, as before, never "inside the exception".

PAUSE MESSAGES ARE NOT WRITTEN BY THE LEAD. scripts/lib/pause_protocol.py renders
the one standard message used here and by manual pauses. The terminal and desktop
SendMessage gates validate its complete text before delivery. The lead may not
append termination, cancellation, hand-in or restart instructions. The pause-until
line retains the existing registry binding; delivery is a request, not evidence
that execution is already held. No subagent implementation is changed here.

THE READING, FIRST: CLAUDE CODE'S OWN `get_usage` (2026-09-25). Each poll starts
`claude` as a CONTROL-ONLY connection and asks it for the account's usage,
exactly as the desktop app does (Codex, codex/claude-quota-settings at
c53f85c9, richos-core/src/quota/probe.rs; spec: richos-hq
docs/plans/desktop-claude-quota-settings-2026-09-25.md, "Data source and
process ownership"): stream-json in and out, no setting sources, no session
persistence, no tools, strict and empty MCP config, CLAUDECODE removed, an
`initialize` then a `get_usage` control request, each bounded at 20 s, frames
capped at 256 KiB. It never sends a user message, so it is not a model turn.
One difference, on purpose: the desktop keeps one connection open; this
watcher is a short-lived script with 5 minutes between polls, so it starts
the process in its own process group, captured at spawn, and ends that group
on every read. The working directory is `/`, which this user cannot write, so
a read cannot leave anything behind. Measured here on 2026-09-25 with claude
2.1.282: initialize 1.2 s, get_usage 7.2 s, five_hour answered, the only
message type on stdout `control_response`, nothing written to the working
directory and no transcript under ~/.claude/projects.

Why it is first: the status-line file below re-renders only when the lead
speaks, so an idle lead left the reading 10 minutes old at the 91%/95%
readings of 07:57Z and 08:07Z. get_usage is fresh at every poll. When it
fails (no `claude`, a timeout, an error, no subscription limits reported, or
an answer this file cannot read), the watcher says why and falls back to the
status-line file, where every rule below still applies, including waking the
lead to refresh it.

THE FALLBACK READING (design notes: richos-hq/docs/plans/budget-self-management-2026-09-10.md)
  ~/.claude/statusline-payload.json -> rate_limits.five_hour.used_percentage and
  .resets_at (epoch seconds). ~/.claude/statusline.sh copies the host's payload
  there on every status-line render (since 2026-09-10). Nothing else is read,
  and no credential is ever touched.

  R6 of the design notes: a reading that is missing, stale or unreadable is its
  OWN state and is never rounded to "plenty left". The file only refreshes when
  a status line renders, so its AGE is checked on EVERY poll.

  HOW THE RULE FAILED ON 2026-09-25, AND WHY STALE IS ONE POLL. The lead's own
  one-off watcher read five_hour stuck at 56% from 00:43Z to 01:08Z, at 71%
  from 01:13Z to 01:33Z and at 89% from 01:53Z to 02:13Z, then 100% at 02:18Z.
  The lead was idle waiting on teammates, its status line did not render, the
  payload did not refresh, and the 93% crossing was never seen. The threshold
  was right; the reading was old. So a reading older than ONE poll interval is
  UNKNOWN — never the current value — and the watcher wakes the lead with
  QUOTA-STALE, because the lead's own reply is what re-renders the status line
  (the host runs it when "a new assistant message arrives"). The replay of
  that log is quota-watch.test.sh case R01.

  WHAT ELSE REFRESHES IT, checked 2026-09-25: only ~/.claude/statusline.sh
  writes the file (grep over ~/.claude's scripts and settings, and this engine,
  which only reads it). The host runs that script at session start, on a new
  assistant message, after /compact, on a permission or vim mode change, when a
  rate-limit window's resets_at passes, and on an optional statusLine
  `refreshInterval` timer (code.claude.com/docs/en/statusline, "When it
  updates"; not set on this machine). Teammate activity is not on that list.
  A refreshInterval would re-render while the lead is idle, but whether the
  host's rate_limits figure moves with teammates' API responses is NOT
  verified, and a re-render that rewrites an old figure would make the file's
  age a false freshness signal. So nothing here depends on it.

  Within one window usage only grows, so a STALE reading at or above the
  threshold is still at or above it: it is reported as "at least", and the
  lead is woken to pause. A stale reading BELOW the threshold proves nothing
  and is UNKNOWN. A reading whose window has already ended describes a window
  that no longer exists and is UNKNOWN.

THE THRESHOLD is data, declared once: QUOTA_PAUSE_PERCENT in the entity's
orchestration.config, beside MODEL_CEILING. quota-watch.sh resolves the entity
and hands the raw value in; an undeclared or malformed value is UNKNOWN, never
a default, because a second place holding 93 is how the number drifts.

THE POLLING NEVER STOPS (2026-09-28). Until today --watch EXITED to wake the
lead, because a background command's exit is what reaches an idle lead. It did
so at the 14:30Z reset and on a get_usage timeout at 15:32Z, and each time
nothing polled until the lead noticed and started it again by hand. Waking the
lead was right; ending the polling to do it was the defect. So the two are now
separate processes:

  THE POLLER polls every 300 s for as long as its session lives and never
  stops on an event. It writes each poll line to polls.log and each wake-up,
  once, to events.jsonl, in ~/.claude/state/quota-watch/<session>/
  (QUOTA_WATCH_STATE_DIR overrides, for tests). One per session: it holds
  poller.lock for its whole life, and it ends when the session's own claude
  process has gone (its pid and start time, recorded at spawn).

  THE DOORBELL is how a wake-up reaches the lead:
    --monitor  the engine's plugin monitor (monitors/monitors.json), which
               Claude Code starts with EVERY interactive session and stops
               when the session ends. Each line a monitor prints reaches the
               lead as a notification without the monitor ending, so it prints
               every wake-up and keeps going. It starts the poller if none is
               running, and starts it again if it ever dies.
    --watch    the fallback, for a session where plugin monitors do not run:
               a background command that exits on the next wake-up, as before.
               The poller keeps polling between one --watch and the next, and
               a wake-up that comes while none is running waits in the journal
               for the next --watch to print it.
  With no session process to tie a poller to (a plain terminal), --watch polls
  in the foreground and prints everything, never stopping.

  A get_usage failure (timeout, refusal) is retried every 60 s instead of
  every 300 s, and it wakes nobody by itself. Once get_usage has answered in
  this run, an outage wakes the lead only when the threshold could have been
  crossed unseen: when the freshest reading plus the fastest rise this watcher
  has measured over the time since it was taken reaches the threshold, or when
  the freshest reading is two polls old, whichever comes first (the rule's own
  resolution is one poll; two polls means a check he ordered has been missed,
  and the measured rise is not a guarantee). See outage_verdict().

EXIT CODES
  --once    0 below the threshold, 1 at or above it (pause), 2 unknown,
            3 at or above it with the reset less than 20 minutes away (no
            pause; a hold in place releases)
  --status  the same codes as --once
  --watch   0 after printing the next wake-up (QUOTA-THRESHOLD, QUOTA-RELEASE,
            WINDOW-RESET, QUOTA-REFRESH, QUOTA-STALE, QUOTA-UNKNOWN or a weekly
            one), or at once when the session's monitor already delivers them;
            2 when it cannot watch at all. The poller does not stop with it.
  --monitor runs for the whole session; 2 when it cannot watch at all
  --alive   0 a poller is polling and something delivers its wake-ups, 1 a
            poller is polling but nothing delivers them, 2 no poller
  --notice  always 0 (it is a SessionStart hook's body)
