"""second_review.py: ONE SECOND REVIEW OF A TEAMMATE'S EXACT COMMITS, BY A DIFFERENT MODEL.

===========================================================================
WHAT THIS EXISTS FOR
===========================================================================
On 2026-10-08 the CEO fetched a Codex review of an agent's work by hand four
times (richos-hq docs/reviews/2026-10-08-dictation-slices-1-4/). Each one found
defects the author's own tests had passed; the first found two release
blockers in dictation slices 1-4 after they were already on main. His words,
ruling §113: "A regular RichOS user can never be expected anything even
remotely close to that. So, this all must be completely automated."

This is slice 1 of richos-hq docs/plans/2026-10-09-automatic-second-review-
and-t3-ideas.md: the command that does one review the way those four were
done. Slice 2's watcher starts it by itself; slice 3's land refuses work whose
tip has no passing verdict. Sage's check of that plan (...-sage-check.md) is
part of the spec, and every place below that follows one of his catches says
so.

===========================================================================
WHAT IT READS (plan §2.2): RECORDS, NEVER ANYONE'S SUMMARY
===========================================================================
  * THE ORIGINAL WORDS. For a teammate (--name): the brief exactly as it
    received it, the first message of its own transcript, which carries the
    CEO's verbatim sentence. Otherwise --words-file, read as bytes. A review
    with no original words is refused before any reviewer starts: a review
    against nobody's request can only check the code against itself.
  * THE EXACT COMMITS, base..tip. The tree at the tip is exported with
    `git archive` into this run's scratch folder (allocated by the wrapper with
    the engine's scratch.sh), with the commit log and the diff beside it. The
    author cannot move what is reviewed, and the reviewer never works in the
    author's workspace.
  * WHAT THE AUTHOR CLAIMS: its commit messages, its last report (the last
    text it wrote in its transcript) and any --claims-file.
  * EARLIER REVIEWS OF THE SAME WORK, from the ledger below, so a recheck
    says of each earlier finding: fixed, still-open or withdrawn.
  * THE REPOSITORY'S OWN RULES: AGENTS.md and docs/development/verification-
    retries.md as they are at the tip, and the reviewer duty
    (mega-lander/duties/reviewer.md).

===========================================================================
WHICH MODEL (plan §2.3, Sage's catches 3, 4 and 10)
===========================================================================
  * Codex reviews Claude's work: `codex exec` from the CLI inside ChatGPT.app,
    looked up on every run because it moves (it is an alpha), its --version
    recorded. Pinned, never left to a default: model gpt-6.1-sol, reasoning
    effort high (what he reviewed with, from Codex Desktop's own session
    record of 2026-10-08), approvals never, sandbox workspace-write rooted at
    the export (-C), so a fixture compiles there and nothing else is written;
    --skip-git-repo-check because an archive has no .git; --output-schema for
    the one fixed answer shape.
  * INVISIBLE IN THE USER'S OWN CODEX AND CHATGPT APPS (the app tells users
    "this review process won't be visible in their regular ChatGPT/Codex
    app"): --ephemeral. Measured 2026-10-09: a review run without it added a
    row to ~/.codex/state_5.sqlite `threads` (source exec, titled with the
    review's prompt), a rollout under ~/.codex/sessions/ and thread history;
    an --ephemeral run added none of the three and used the same login. The
    model and effort every row records come from Codex's own
    SessionConfiguredEvent, which it logs on stderr at RUST_LOG=codex_exec=info
    (`model: "gpt-6.1-sol"`, `reasoning_effort: Some(High)`, `rollout_path:
    None`); the token count from its turn.completed events. His plan meter
    lived only in the session record, so it is no longer recorded.
  * ISOLATED FROM THE USER'S OWN SETUP (CODEX_ISOLATION, CEO 2026-10-09 ~05:00Z:
    macOS asked him whether "Terminal.app" may control "Codex Computer
    Use.app"). His ~/.codex/config.toml has a `notify` program that ran at
    every turn end and sent Apple Events from the Terminal the review started
    in, plus his MCP servers and plugins (a reviewer offered Computer Use and
    control of his Chrome). So Codex runs without his config.toml
    (--ignore-user-config; the login in CODEX_HOME is still used) or his
    exec-policy rules, `notify` empty, and plugins, apps, hooks, computer use
    and browser use off. Claude runs with no MCP server at all
    (--strict-mcp-config): no setting sources does not skip them.
  * Claude reviews Codex's work (a codex/ branch), and is the fallback when
    Codex cannot run (missing, signed out, at its usage limit: any exit without
    an answer that is not the time limit). The fallback is Opus, at high
    effort, in a fresh headless context with no setting sources (none of the
    lead's hooks or plugins), every write going through Bash, which Claude
    Code's OS sandbox confines to the export (the file-writing tools, which
    the sandbox does not confine, are removed), and --json-schema for the
    same answer shape. It respects his quota
    rule: quota-watch's own reading is taken first, and while a pause is in
    force (quota-watch --once exit 1) no Claude review starts.
  * A same-model reviewer is NOT refused (Sage's catch 3: what made the four
    reviews work was a fresh context, the original words and fixtures, not a
    different tier). Both models are recorded, so use can show whether it
    matters.

===========================================================================
HOW IT RUNS (Sage's catch 5)
===========================================================================
  * Admission by the engine's own CPU rule (cpu_policy.admission_open, 80% of
    total CPU), sampled from the kernel's host counters. No cap on how many
    reviews run at once: a review is mostly remote model time. A closed
    admission is waited on (bounded, one sample per 30 s, said once); an
    unmeasurable CPU refuses.
  * A 60-minute limit (the first by-hand review took about 30). Past it the
    reviewer is stopped by its own process id (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL).
  * The reviewer runs in this command's own process group, never a session of
    its own: review-watch starts second-review.sh leading a group and stops a
    review by signaling that group, so the reviewer ends with it whenever it
    was forked (second review of b5ff41f02, finding 1).
  * The reviewer's builds are capped at REVIEW_BUILD_JOBS jobs (CARGO_BUILD_JOBS,
    MAKEFLAGS, CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL in its environment, and said in its
    input). The first real runs, 2026-10-09: the engine's CPU breaker stopped a
    `rustc` the Claude reviewer started at 5.08 cores for 10 s.

===========================================================================
THE VERDICT (plan §2.2, §2.4)
===========================================================================
  * The answer must have the fixed shape; anything else is no verdict.
  * It must name the exact tip (the full SHA, or a prefix of at least 7);
    a verdict about another commit is refused.
  * The verdict follows the findings (ruling §116): every finding, and every
    earlier finding still open, says whether it blocks. It blocks only when a
    user could hit it in normal use of the work AND it breaks what the work
    promises. Changes-requested exactly when at least one blocks; passed
    otherwise, whatever the reviewer wrote. Priority is information only.
  * A passed review files each finding it did not block on, new or still open
    from earlier, in <state>/review-follow-ups.jsonl, once; the stdout line
    says how many and where.
  * One row per review in <state>/reviews.jsonl and the full text, answer and
    fixtures in <state>/reviews/<id>/ (<state> is ~/.claude/state, outside
    every repository and session, like the escalation ledger). One line on
    stdout says the verdict.

Test seams (second-review.test.sh only): SECOND_REVIEW_STATE_DIR,
SECOND_REVIEW_CODEX, SECOND_REVIEW_CLAUDE,
SECOND_REVIEW_QUOTA_CMD, SECOND_REVIEW_CPU_BUSY, SECOND_REVIEW_TIMEOUT_SECONDS.
