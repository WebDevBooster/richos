# record-canary.test.sh — PROVE THE RECORD CANARY IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.
#
# scripts/lib/record-canary.sh watches the operator's record — the ownership
# ledger, the platform's fallback event log, the team directories — per suite.
# A canary that cannot go red is a green tick printed over the defect, and the
# defect here is dated: on 2026-09-11 a green suite wrote a false `terminated`
# witness for a running agent into the operator's real ledger and nothing said
# so. So this suite drives the detector onto each of the three shapes that
# class has taken and off them again:
#
#   a `terminated` row appended to the ledger          (9b, 2026-09-11)
#   fixture rows appended to the fallback event log     (feedbeef, 2026-09-10)
#   a fixture team directory created                    (session-deadbeef, 2026-09-10)
#
# and pins the one thing it deliberately cannot see — the platform's own
# per-turn `finished` rows — so nobody reads more into a green run than is
# there.
#
# Everything happens under a throwaway CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR. This suite reads
# nothing under the operator's real ~/.claude and writes nothing there —
# which, given what it is about, is the least it can do.
