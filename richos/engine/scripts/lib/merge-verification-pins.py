"""merge-verification-pins.py — git's merge driver for the two verification maps.

    merge-verification-pins.py %O %A %B %P      (registered by richos/app/scripts/autocheck/install.sh)

The maps (richos/engine/scripts/lib/verification-dependencies.json and
docs/development/verification-input-qualifications.json) pin readers by sha256, and every branch
that changes a pinned reader renews its pin. So any two branches built in parallel conflicted
there: on 2026-10-05 alone four merges stopped on them, and each time an agent took one side's
lines and re-ran renew-verification-pins.py by hand (a64668554, ccc3ff319). A pin is not text to
combine; it is the hash of the merged file.

So this driver merges the two documents as JSON, three ways, and then regenerates the pins:

  1. Every entry from both sides is kept. A key one side added is added; a value one side changed
     and the other did not takes the change; a key one side removed and the other left as it was
     is removed (a key one side removed and the other changed is kept, changed). Lists are merged
     as sets in order: what either side added is kept, what one side removed is removed.
  2. A pin both sides changed to different values is taken from the merged FILE: the pinned
     file's three versions (merge base, ours, theirs) are merged with `git merge-file`, and the
     pin becomes the sha256 of that result, which is what renew-verification-pins.py would write
     once the merge is on disk. A pin is a `sha256` beside a `path`/`source`, or a value in a
     `sources` map.
  3. Anything else both sides changed differently is a real conflict: the driver leaves git's own
     conflict markers in the file (`git merge-file`) and exits 1, exactly as without it.

The other side's commit is read from the merge itself: MERGE_HEAD when git has written it, else
the GITHEAD_<sha> variable git sets for a merge's other side, else GIT_REFLOG_ACTION
("merge <name>"). When it cannot be found (a rebase, a cherry-pick) a pin both sides changed is
left at ours and the commit check names it (autocheck/dependency-pins.py), with the renewal
command, before anything lands.

The output is written as renew-verification-pins.py writes it (json.dumps, indent 2, newline), so
a merged map is byte-identical to one renewed by hand.
