"""codex_watch.py: CODEX'S MESSAGES TO THE LEAD WAKE THE LEAD, WITH NOBODY STARTING ANYTHING.

===========================================================================
WHAT THIS EXISTS FOR
===========================================================================
Codex writes to the lead through append-only files (each entry starts
`## <UTC time> — <subject>`):

    ~/.richos-coordination/rich-codex/to-rich.md
    ~/.richos-coordination/rich-codex-questions/to-rich.md

The lead was supposed to start a background watcher on them at every session
start. On 2026-10-05 it did not, and Codex's 08:11Z "READY TO LAND" entry for
codex/split-proof-evidence (3ec820348) sat unlanded for about five hours,
until the CEO asked. A watcher that must be started by hand is the same defect
one step later, so this one is started by Claude Code itself with every
interactive session: the engine's plugin monitor (monitors/monitors.json), as
quota-watch and stall-watch are.

===========================================================================
WHAT IT DOES
===========================================================================
Every POLL_SECONDS it looks at each channel's size. New bytes are told once
the file has stopped growing for one look (an entry written in two parts is
still one entry), and only up to the last complete line. The new text is split
at its `## ` headers and each entry is printed as ONE block, header plus EVERY
line of it (the old hand watcher printed only the last entry and missed two
requests on 2026-09-27). Each printed block is one notification to the lead.

What was told is kept per session, so a restarted monitor repeats nothing, and
in one shared record (last-told.json), so a NEW session starts where the last
one stopped: an entry written while no session was watching is told at the
next session's first looks. The very first start on a machine starts from the
end of each file; the backlog is not replayed.

It only reads and prints. It never writes to a channel, answers, lands or
messages anything.

===========================================================================
COMMANDS (codex-watch.sh passes --engine-root and --config)
===========================================================================
  --monitor  the plugin monitor's body: runs for the whole session, one per
             session, and ends with its session
  --tick     one look against the session's state, printing what the monitor
             would print (codex-watch.test.sh drives it)

Settings (tests only): CODEX_WATCH_CHANNELS (colon-separated files),
CODEX_WATCH_STATE_DIR, CODEX_WATCH_POLL_SECONDS.
