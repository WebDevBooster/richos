"""shell_c.py: refuse, BEFORE Claude Code asks the user, a Bash command that wraps an inline script
in `bash -c`, `sh -c` or `zsh -c`.

The CEO, 2026-10-09, saw "This shell -c script runs rm and could not be checked. Do you want to
proceed?" for a teammate's command, hit yes, and wrote: "I hope RichOS app users won't be bothered by
this." (The same prompt reached him on 2026-10-07 from the lead's own commands.) Claude Code cannot
check an inline shell script, so it asks the person. A PreToolUse refusal runs first, so the agent
gets the rewrite and the person never sees a prompt.

What is refused: ONE plain match over the whole command text, quotes and comments included: a word
named bash, sh, zsh, dash or ksh (with or without a path or quotes) followed, anywhere later in the
command (across lines and separators), by a short-option group containing c (-c, -lc, ...).
`bash test.sh && git diff --cached` passes (--cached is a long option); `bash x.sh | grep -c y` is refused, an accepted false positive; `bash test.sh -c x` is refused, an
accepted false positive. A command that only MENTIONS `bash -c` (a commit message, an echo) is refused too:
an accepted false positive; the message says to put the text in a file (git commit -F <file>).

IT IS A TEXT MATCH AND LEAKS (eval, a script file that itself runs bash -c). Its job is to stop the
habitual command, not to out-think the shell. Any error in the check is a pass.
Shared by the operator-install rule (scripts/hooks/guard-no-shell-c.sh) and by the RichOS app's hook
(mega-lander/app.py validate_shell_target).
