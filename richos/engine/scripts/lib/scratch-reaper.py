"""scratch-reaper.py — the scan, the verdict and the deletion. No schedule here.

===========================================================================
WHAT THIS IS FOR
===========================================================================
On 2026-09-17 macOS said "Your disk is almost full" — 1.8 GB free of 460 GB.
19 GB of it was scratch that nothing was using, and it was reclaimed because a
person read the warning and deleted it by hand. That is the failure: not the
garbage, THE PERSON. The CEO's words the same morning: "There needs to be a
mechanism to make sure that scratch directories get deleted on a regular
basis. I don't want piles of garbage to pile up endlessly."

===========================================================================
THE ONE RULE THAT DECIDES EVERYTHING HERE
===========================================================================
A scratch directory is deleted because SOMETHING PROVED NOBODY OWNS IT, never
because it looks old. Age is a floor applied AFTER the proof, and it exists
only to cover the seconds between a session starting and recording itself.

The proof has three possible answers and THREE is not folded into two:

  RUNNING        a session file names this session and its process, and that
                 process is still the same process. Kept, always.
  ENDED          no running `claude` process on this machine is this session,
                 established by EXHAUSTION: every running claude process is
                 named by a session file, and none of them names this one.
  INDETERMINATE  a claude process is running that NO session file names, and
                 it started early enough that it could be the owner. Kept,
                 counted, and named in the verdict line.

INDETERMINATE is never collapsed into ENDED. The whole reason this engine
carries an agent-liveness module at all is the 2026-08-31 incident in which a
confident wrong answer beat an honest "I cannot tell" — absence prompts a
check, a false positive does not.

The liveness primitive is NOT reimplemented here. process_start() comes from
mega-lander/workspaces.py, which is where "ended is read from the operating
system, never guessed" already lives (spec point 12). If that import fails
this module FAILS LOUD rather than falling back to a weaker test: a reaper
that silently downgrades its own liveness check is the one shape of this
program nobody could ever notice was broken.

===========================================================================
WHAT IT WILL DELETE, AND THE FOUR WALLS IT GOES THROUGH FIRST
===========================================================================
Classes (each named in the log line, so every deletion says why):

  claude-session   <root>/<slug>/<session-uuid> whose session is ENDED
  claude-husk      a <root>/<slug> directory left empty by the above
  claude-orphan    a file or non-session directory sitting directly in a
                   scratch root whose mtime PREDATES THE START OF EVERY
                   RUNNING claude PROCESS — so no running session can have
                   written it, and none can write it again
  tmp-workspace    a $TMPDIR directory matching a declared pattern that no
                   process holds open
  nightly-release  / nightly-log  beyond the declared retention

Walls, applied to every candidate, in order, after the verdict and before the
unlink. Any wall that trips makes the entry INDETERMINATE — never a silent
skip, because a candidate that cannot be deleted for a structural reason is
exactly the thing somebody needs to read:

  1. CONTAINMENT   the real path must sit strictly inside a declared root,
                   and at least one component below it. A symlink is never
                   followed; the link itself is what would be removed.
  2. NO REPOSITORY the tree must contain no .git anywhere. A scratch
                   directory holding a checkout is somebody's work.
  3. NOT REGISTERED no registered workspace path may be the candidate, sit
                   inside it, or contain it. Read from the workspace registry
                   and the worktree ledger — the same two files the worktree
                   reaper reads.
  4. NEVER-TOUCH   $HOME, ~/.claude, ~/RichOS, ~/.richos-signing, the nightly
                   source worktree and the nightly runtime, by name.

===========================================================================
WHAT IT WILL NOT DELETE, MEASURED RATHER THAN PROMISED (2026-09-17)
===========================================================================
  * The live session's own scratchpad — 4,270 MB of the 5.2 GB under
    /private/tmp/claude-501 on the morning this was written. The reaper that
    would have prevented that morning's disk-full warning does not exist,
    because the biggest pile belonged to a session that was RUNNING.
  * ~/.richos-nightly/source — 5.89 GB, and A REGISTERED GIT WORKTREE. Walls
    2 and 3 both refuse it and the config never nominates it.
  * The 244 loose *.out files in the scratch root that morning: every one had
    an mtime AFTER the live session's process started, so the claude-orphan
    rule kept all of them. A rule that deletes nothing on the day it ships is
    a rule whose safety is measurable.

    The old form was `mktime(strptime(text)) - time.timezone`. mktime interprets
    the struct as LOCAL time, and `time.timezone` is the zone's STANDARD offset —
    it does not move for daylight saving. So in any zone observing DST, in the
    months it is observed, this returned a start time one hour EARLY. Measured on
    this machine, 2026-09-18, on a process started at that instant:

        timezone 0   altzone -3600   daylight 1   tm_isdst 1

    WHY IT SURVIVED: it fails in the SAFE direction. Every caller asks "is this
    older than the earliest running session", and a start time an hour early
    makes the answer no more often, so the reaper KEPT things it could have
    deleted rather than deleting things it should have kept. An hour of lost
    coverage every run, reported by nothing, in the one primitive the claude-
    orphan rule and the deny-by-default temp arm both rest on.

    It was found by a test that asserted WHICH REASON a KEEP carried, not merely
    that the tree survived — S21o. A case that had only checked the directory was
    still there would have passed against the wrong answer for ever.

    `ps` is run under TZ=UTC0 by _ps_env(), so the string is UTC and timegm is
    the only conversion that is right in every zone and every season.

        # more siblings at ~249 each, ws-spec-* at 52, byref.* — 0.61 GB and
        # 2,800 directory entries of test scaffolding.
        #

        # BREAKS THE MECHANISM. Undecidable makes the run exit 3, and exit 3 is
        # what the new watchdog turns into a MASSIVE ALERT. A permanent alert

        #      or sit inside one — which is what actually protects a real
        #      worktree, and it is untouched

        ===================================================================
        THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR — A FAILED DELETION HID ITSELF
        ===================================================================
        Measured on the first real run of the widened sweep, 2026-09-18. Five of
        37,146 deletions failed with EPERM/EACCES on git-worktree fixtures. The
        NEXT run reported `ok:true, failures:0` — with all five directories
        still on disk.

        The reason is that `shutil.rmtree` had already removed some children
        before it hit the unremovable one, and THAT UPDATED THE DIRECTORY'S
        MTIME. The age is taken from the newest mtime, so the tree came back as
        "touched 1 min ago, inside the 2 h legacy floor" and was KEPT — not
        failed, not undecidable, KEPT, silently, for two hours.

        THE REAPER'S OWN FAILURE MADE ITS NEXT ATTEMPT IMPOSSIBLE AND ERASED THE
        EVIDENCE. Under the CEO's rule — "if the clean-up fails or impossible for
        some reason, then Rich must get a MASSIVE ALERT about it" — that is the
        worst available outcome: garbage that cannot be removed produces no
        alert, because the act of failing to remove it resets the clock and the
        next report says everything is fine.

        So a failure is now DURABLE. It is written to a state file, and every
        subsequent run reconsiders it REGARDLESS OF ITS AGE, retries it, and
        keeps reporting it until it is actually gone. The alert therefore
        persists until a person clears it, which is what the rule asks for.

        THE AGE FLOOR IS THE ONLY THING BYPASSED. Every wall still applies, and
        so does the open-handle check: the floor exists to cover the race
        between a thing starting and registering itself, and a path this program
        has already adjudicated and tried to delete is not in that race.

        it never asks what the directory is called.

        The verdict for one child, in order:

          released in the ledger        -> DELETE (its maker said it was done)
          owning pid ALIVE              -> KEEP, always, whatever the TTL says
          owning pid unknowable         -> INDETERMINATE
          owning pid dead, young        -> KEEP (the age floor)
          owning pid dead, old enough   -> DELETE
          no ledger row at all          -> the pid comes off the NAME and the
                                           same ladder applies; if the name
                                           carries no pid either, it is
                                           garbage by construction, because
                                           the only way to get a directory
                                           under this root is to ask the
                                           allocator for one.

        A LIVE PID IS ALWAYS KEEP, AND TTL NEVER OVERRIDES IT. An expired TTL
        means the caller underestimated its own run, which is a bad estimate
        and not permission to delete a directory a running process is writing
        into.

        THIS COMMENT USED TO CLAIM TTL COVERED PID REUSE AND IT DID NOT.
        It read: "TTL earns its place on the other side: it is what lets a row
        whose pid has been REUSED by an unrelated process still age out, because
        the age floor and the TTL both have to pass." A live pid returned KEEP
        two lines above TTL was ever consulted, so a reused pid was immortal and
        the comment described a safety the program did not have. What actually
        answers pid reuse is owner_state(): a process that started after the
        directory was created cannot have created it. TTL is what it always
        was — a declaration of intent, never an authority to delete.

        =================================================================
        D11 — A NAME-DERIVED PID IS ATTRIBUTION, NOT LIVENESS
        =================================================================
        `pid_from_name()` takes the digits before the first `-`, and `pid_alive()`
        returns True on PermissionError. Frank put a directory called
        `1-frank-immortal-b` in the allocator root and the reaper said:

            KEEP  2.0 MB  .../richos-scratch/1-frank-immortal-b
                  why: pid 1 is ALIVE (owner of 'unrecorded', from the directory
                       name) — a live owner is kept whatever its TTL says

        Forever, at any size, with no alert and no TTL escape — and SILENTLY BY
        CONSTRUCTION, because a KEEP is the reaper working as designed. macOS
        recycles pids at 99998, so a week-old directory whose name begins with a
        number that is now a live pid is not exotic.

        THE LEDGER ROW IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF FACT AND IS STILL TRUSTED. It was
        written BY the allocator AT allocation time; the digits in a name are a
        second copy of it for the case where the ledger is lost, and a copy that
        can be forged by naming a directory is evidence of attribution and not of
        life. So a name-derived pid has to pass three tests that a ledger row does
        not, and each of them can only ever take a KEEP away:

          1. IT MUST BE OURS. A PermissionError means the process belongs to
             another user, and the allocator runs as us — so it cannot be the
             caller. This one test alone retires `1-frank-immortal-b`.
          2. IT MUST BE ABOVE A DECLARED FLOOR. Measured on this machine: the
             lowest pid owned by uid 501 is 160, while root's boot daemons hold
             1, 88, 90, 92, 93. A single- or double-digit pid is not a harness.
          3. IT MUST HAVE STARTED NO LATER THAN THE DIRECTORY WAS CREATED. A
             process that began after the directory existed cannot have made it,
             which is exactly what pid reuse looks like.

        THE BRIEF ASKED FOR TEST 3 THE OTHER WAY ROUND — "a pid whose process
        start time precedes the directory's creation is unattributed" — and that
        is inverted. A creator necessarily exists BEFORE it creates: a session
        process started this morning and allocating scratch this afternoon is the
        normal case, and refusing it would make every long-running owner
        unattributed. What proves reuse is starting AFTERWARDS.

        An unattributed pid does NOT mean delete. It means the allocation has no
        proven live owner, so the ordinary ladder applies underneath it — the age
        floor, the open-file wall, and all four walls.

        =================================================================
        THE REUSE TEST APPLIES TO A LEDGER ROW TOO, AND THAT IS A SECOND
        HOLE IN THE SAME FAMILY — FOUND BY THE MUTATION HARNESS
        =================================================================
        Mutant M37 was written to prove the ledger branch was load-bearing and it
        came back "the suite still PASSED without this property", which sent me
        back to the code with a better question. `scan_scratch_root`'s own comment
        claimed: "TTL earns its place on the other side: it is what lets a row
        whose pid has been REUSED by an unrelated process still age out, because
        the age floor and the TTL both have to pass."
        **THAT WAS NOT TRUE OF THE CODE.** A live pid returned KEEP before TTL was
        ever consulted — "a live owner is kept whatever its TTL says" — so a ledger
        row from three days ago whose pid now belongs to an unrelated live process
        was immortal in exactly the way `1-frank-immortal-b` was. The comment
        described a safety the program did not have.
        So the reuse test is applied to BOTH sources: it is a fact about the
        filesystem and the process table rather than a question of how much a
        record is trusted. What the ledger row earns is exemption from the two
        NAME-shape tests — the uid test and the pid floor — because it was written
        by our own process at allocation time and its uid is therefore implied.

    # THE DENY-BY-DEFAULT TEMP ARM — added 2026-09-18, and it is the answer to
    # the shape of the defect rather than to its instances.
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    # FRANK'S D1/D2, MEASURED ON THIS MACHINE AND RE-DERIVED HERE BEFORE THIS
    # WAS WRITTEN: `scan_tmp` skipped past any $TMPDIR entry matching neither
    # declared pattern list, and /private/tmp outside the two claude roots was
    # read by no arm at all.
    #
    #   direct children of $TMPDIR                   60,942
    #   covered by a declared pattern                 4,172   (0.08 GB)
    #   INVISIBLE to every arm                       56,770   (1.95 GB)
    #
    # THE ARGUMENT IS THE ASYMMETRY, NOT THE BYTE COUNT. An allowlist of names
    # can only ever contain names somebody read off a creator, and the biggest
    # invisible family on this disk — `richos-owned-wake-native-*`, 42 entries,
    # 198 MB, 9 days old — HAS NO CREATOR IN THE TREE ANY MORE:
    #
    #   $ grep -rln 'owned-wake-native' richos/     -> (no matches)
    #
    # A name nobody can read cannot be enumerated, so the enumeration cannot
    # converge. A keep-list of FOREIGN owners runs the other way: it names other
    # people's software, it is short, and it stops growing.
    #
    # ===================================================================
    # WHAT MAKES THIS SAFE, AND IT IS NOT THE AGE
    # ===================================================================
    # The primary proof is the one scan_orphan already uses on loose files in a
    # claude scratch root, and it is a proof rather than a guess: THE NEWEST
    # MTIME IN THE TREE PREDATES THE START OF EVERY RUNNING SESSION PROCESS, so
    # no running session can have written it and none can write it again. On this
    # machine at the time of writing there is one running session, started
    # "Wed Sep 16 23:31:27 2026" (TZ=UTC0) — so nothing touched in the last day
    # and a half is a candidate, whatever it is called.
    #
    # Four more conditions sit on top, and every one of them can only make the
    # arm refuse:
    #
    #   * OWNED BY THIS UID. /private/tmp is world-writable and shared: 97 of its
    #     753 entries are root's. Another user's temp directory is never ours to
    #     collect, and the check is one lstat.
    #   * PAST A DECLARED AGE FLOOR of its own, far longer than the legacy arm's
    #     two hours, because the legacy families are named-and-known and these
    #     are not.
    #   * NOTHING HOLDS A FILE OPEN INSIDE IT, from the same cached whole-machine
    #     lsof both older arms use.
    #   * ALL FOUR WALLS, with wall 2 (no .git) standing in full unless
    #     SCRATCH_UNKNOWN_GIT_IS_FIXTURE says otherwise.
    #
    # THE LEGACY PATTERN LIST IS NOT MADE REDUNDANT BY THIS, and that is a
    # finding against the brief that ordered the change. Frank's Fix 1 says the
    # families "become redundant under deny-by-default and can be deleted from
    # the config". They cannot: they are the FAST LANE. A legacy family is swept
    # at two hours because the 105 GB directory reached that size inside one run,
    # and this arm's floor is measured in days. Deleting the list would trade a
    # two-hour reclaim for a three-day one on exactly the family that filled the
    # disk. The list stays, and what changes is its JOB: it is no longer the
    # coverage, it is a fast lane on top of the coverage.

        matched two globs and in practice zero directories, so one `lsof -t --

        For a directory that is almost never the question: a process writing
        into a scratch tree holds a FILE INSIDE it, not the directory itself.
        Measured on this machine:

            $ lsof -t -- .../holdertest              -> (nothing)
            $ lsof +D .../holdertest -t               -> 94085
            $ lsof -t -- .../holdertest/f.lock        -> 94085

        So the old form answered "nobody holds it" about a directory a live
        `tail -f` was reading, and BOTH callers believed it. That is the same
        defect as D5 one level down, and it was in the arm that exists to
        protect a live agent workspace: a `richos-*-workspace` with a process
        writing inside it read as unheld.

        THE COST, and why it is acceptable here: `+D` walks the tree, which is
        why the $TMPDIR legacy arm uses the cached whole-machine snapshot
        instead. This function is only ever reached for ONE candidate that has
        already passed the age floor, so the walk is of a single stale scratch
        directory rather than of $TMPDIR's 87,000 entries.

        A TIMEOUT RETURNS None, NEVER ''. The three states are load-bearing:
        None becomes INDETERMINATE and keeps the tree, whereas '' would mean
        "proven unheld" and permission to delete. A slow answer must never be
        allowed to read as an absence of holders.

        His finding: `richos-rechecks` (17.01 GiB) and
        `richos-password-free-workspaces` (8.41 GiB) sit under ~/ab in NO ledger
        row and under NO declared root, so the worktree reaper will never see them
        and the scratch reaper will never see them. True, and re-measured here at
        18.90 GB and 13.75 GB.

        HIS PROPOSED SIGNAL DOES NOT SURVIVE THE CENSUS. "Not in the ledger" was
        the natural rule, and running it over the whole of ~/ab on 2026-09-18 gives
        24 of 29 directories unnamed — including `fitapp` (the legacy product),
        `prospects` (the outreach data layer), `li-profile-da""ta-grabber` (the
        capture extension), `deeply`, `saferecord`, `autocoder`, `wsp`, `ai-book`
        and `press-and-publicity`. EVERY ONE OF THOSE IS THE OPERATOR'S OWN
        PROJECT. Under ~/ab the default is "this is somebody's work", which is the
        exact opposite of the default under $TMPDIR, so the deny-by-default shape
        that is right there would be catastrophic here.

        SO THE ASYMMETRY RUNS THE OTHER WAY AND THE SHAPE FOLLOWS IT. An
        enumeration is normally the wrong answer — it is the D1 lesson — but the
        failure modes are not comparable: a missed campaign root costs disk space
        that the watchdog's ~/ab consumer line still reports, while a
        deny-by-default miss costs the product tree. An enumeration that can only
        FAIL TO NOMINATE is a safe enumeration.

        AND NOTHING HERE IS EVER DELETED AUTOMATICALLY. Every one of these trees
        contains a `.git`, which is wall 2 — "a scratch directory holding a
        checkout is somebody's work" — and the reaper refuses those everywhere
        else. §54 has a second branch for exactly this case: *"if the clean-up
        fails or impossible for some reason, then Rich must get a MASSIVE ALERT
        about it and get on with manually deleting the garbage"*. So a campaign
        root past its declared retention is counted into `skipped`, which is what

        AND THAT FILTER DOES NOT EXIST
        =================================================================
        Checked before it was built, against this machine and against the vendor's
        own reference:

            $ docker volume prune --help
              --filter filter   Provide filter values (e.g. "label=<label>")
            $ docker version --format '{{.Server.Version}}'   ->  29.2.0

        and docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/volume/prune: *"The currently
        supported filters are: label"*. There is no `until` for volumes — unlike
        container, image and builder prune, which all take one. So the prescription
        could not have worked, and copying it would have shipped either a command
        that errors on every run or, worse, one whose unknown filter is ignored and
        which therefore prunes with NO AGE LIMIT AT ALL.

        THE AGE IS NOT OPTIONAL HERE, which is why this is not simply
        `docker volume prune -f`. Every other stage of this sweep is safe because
        of its age filter: "an image pulled or built this month is never a
        candidate, however unreferenced it is today". A volume detached from a
        container ten minutes ago is exactly the thing somebody is about to
        reattach. So the window is applied HERE, from
        `docker volume inspect --format '{{.CreatedAt}}'`, which is documented and
        which this machine answers with an RFC3339 timestamp.

        ANONYMOUS VOLUMES ONLY, and that is Docker's own default rather than a
        choice of mine: `docker volume prune` needs `-a` before it will touch a
        NAMED volume, because a name is somebody having meant it. Measured here:
        21 dangling volumes, 402.2 MB, every one carrying

        any age". That is correct as a deletion rule and it leaves a hole:

            $ docker ps --format '{{.Names}} | {{.Image}} | up {{.RunningFor}} | {{.Command}}'
            rl55 | richos-linux:git-latest | up 8 days ago | "sleep infinity"
            rlx  | richos-linux:24.04      | up 8 days ago | "sleep infinity"

        Two `sleep infinity` dev shells, eight days old, pinning 514 MB and 349 MB
        of image so `image prune -a` can never reclaim them. Nothing alerts, and
        that is how dev containers are actually used, so it recurs.

        NOTHING IS EVER STOPPED HERE. A running container may be a service — four
        of the six on this machine are the Buzz production stack — and stopping one
        automatically is a category of action this program does not take. It is
        REPORTED, as a standing entry, so it reaches the garbage alarm and a person
        decides. Same shape as a campaign root, for the same reason.

        Narrow by construction: only images matching a DECLARED throwaway pattern,
        and only past a declared age.

    MODES: directories only, owner bit only, u+rwx — never a mode handed to
    anybody else. A read-only FILE is removable already; what stops an unlink is
    the mode of the DIRECTORY holding it, so widening file modes buys nothing.

    THE uchg FLAG, and why clearing it is right here. Measured 2026-09-18: two
    trees resisted both `shutil.rmtree` AND `/bin/rm -rf` with EPERM, and the
    cause was a single file — `.claude/worktrees/.parked-agent-*/pinned.txt`,
    `chflags uchg`, flag 0x2 — left behind by a harness that tests what happens
    to a pinned file. Its mode was 644 and its owner was the invoking user; only
    the flag stood in the way.

    A uchg FLAG IS NOT A SAFETY BOUNDARY IN A DECLARED HARNESS SANDBOX. By the
    time a path reaches here it has passed all four walls, its owner is provably
    gone, and it has sat untouched for hours (118 in the measured case). The
    alternative is a permanent recurring alert about a test fixture's leftover
    flag — and under the CEO's rule every failure becomes a MASSIVE ALERT, so an
    avoidable one costs the credibility of the unavoidable ones.

    IT IS STILL BOUNDED: only for the classes in _UNSTICKABLE_CLASSES, never for
    a session's scratchpad or the nightly, where a person may have protected
    something deliberately and gets asked instead. And every clearing is logged.
