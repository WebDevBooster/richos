# qa-throwaways.test.sh — behavioral tests for scripts/qa-throwaways.sh.
#
# THE FIXTURE IS SYNTHETIC ON PURPOSE. The counting rules were derived from a
# real walk (ray-opus-vm8, agent ab5634d45f8c0eccb, 1091 rows), and that
# transcript is the operator's own record: it carries brief text, host paths
# and captured output, and it is not this repository's to commit. So each case
# below builds the smallest transcript that exercises one rule, in the same
# JSONL shape the harness writes, and the real walk stays where it is.
#
# Every case that follows exists because a plausible counter gets it wrong:
# a Write-only counter misses two thirds of vm8's helpers; a redirect counter
# without the heredoc/inline distinction counts `python3 - <<PY`; a path
# counter counts a script twice for being copied into the VM; and a counter
# with no toolkit arm reports a walk that ADDED a committed tool as the worst
# offender of the run.
#
# Run directly: scripts/qa-throwaways.test.sh
# Exit 0 = every case passed; exit 1 = at least one failure.
