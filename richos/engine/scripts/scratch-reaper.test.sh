# scratch-reaper.test.sh — A DELETER IS JUDGED ON WHAT IT LEAVES ALONE.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
# ===========================================================================
# Proving that a reaper deletes is one case and it is the easy one. Every
# other case here asks the only question that matters about a program with
# rm -rf in it:
#
#     WHEN IT IS WRONG, IS IT WRONG IN THE DIRECTION THAT COSTS NOTHING?
#
# The liveness cases use a REAL SESSION PROCESS — /bin/sleep started as
# `exec -a "$SUITE_PROC"` — with a REAL entry in the process table and a REAL session
# file naming its pid and its start time. Nothing about liveness is faked or
# injected, because the defect this suite exists to catch is a liveness check
# that has quietly stopped working, and a faked process table cannot catch it.
#
#   S1  a LIVE session's scratch survives.
#   S1b THE POSITIVE CONTROL for S1 — the same directory, same contents, same
#       everything, with the process KILLED, is deleted. Without this, S1
#       passes just as well against a reaper that deletes nothing at all,
#       which is the way a safety test rots.
#   S2  a REGISTERED WORKSPACE inside a scratch root survives (wall 3).
#   S3  INDETERMINATE survives AND SAYS SO: a running claude process that no
#       session file names makes every unattributed scratch undecidable, and
#       the verdict line carries the count.
#   S4  a tree containing a .git survives (wall 2).
#   S5  the LOG carries every deleted path, with bytes and a reason.
#   S6  --apply prints, byte for byte, what the dry run printed, plus one
#       final `applied:` line. A plan that changes when you agree to it is not
#       a plan.
#   S7  a file in a scratch root that PREDATES every running claude process is
#       deleted; one written after the oldest running process started is kept.
#   S8  nightly retention keeps the newest N and deletes the rest, and never
#       touches the source worktree or the runtime.
#   S9  AN UNDECLARED THRESHOLD IS A REFUSAL, not a default. Exit 2, nothing
#       deleted.
#   S10 a $TMPDIR harness workspace that no process holds open is deleted; one
#       held open is kept.
#   S11 the verdict line exits 3 while anything is undecidable — undecidable is
#       a failure, never a footnote beside a success-shaped count.
#
# --- added 2026-09-18 with the allocator root and the legacy sweep -----------
# The 105 GB night: a sandbox named by a bare mktemp sat under $TMPDIR for five
# hours while this reaper ran twice, because SCRATCH_TMP_PATTERNS was an
# allowlist of two globs and nothing matched it.
#
#   S12  THE ALLOCATOR ROOT, DENY-BY-DEFAULT — the arm that would have caught
#        it. A dead owner goes (S12), a LIVE owner stays (S12b, the control), an
#        unrecorded directory goes because the only way to get one there is to
#        ask the allocator (S12c), and with the ledger DELETED a live owner is
#        still protected by the pid in the directory name (S12d).
#   S13  a RELEASED ledger row whose tree survived the rm is deleted.
#   S14  the legacy family sweep: abandoned goes (S14), a fixture containing a
#        .git goes (S14b), A REGISTERED WORKSPACE WEARING A LEGACY NAME IS
#        STILL REFUSED (S14c — wall 3 survived the wall-2 narrowing, which is
#        the case that decides whether that narrowing was safe), and with the
#        narrowing declared OFF the same fixture goes back to undecidable
#        (S14d, the control that makes S14b a decision rather than an oversight).
#   S15  a legacy directory with an open file descriptor inside is kept, and
#        the same directory with its holder gone is deleted (S15b, the control).
#   S16  a STOPPED Docker daemon is skipped silently and is never a failure
#        (S16/S16b); a daemon that ANSWERS is actually asked to prune, both
#        arms, and the bytes it reports reach the log (S16c/S16d, the controls
#        that stop S16 passing against a docker arm that is dead code).
#   S17  A FAILED DELETION MUST NOT HIDE ITSELF. Measured live: five deletions
#        failed with EPERM and the next run said failures=0 with all five still
#        on disk, because rmtree's partial progress bumped each directory's
#        mtime and the age floor then KEPT it — silently, for two hours. The
#        reaper's own failure erased its own evidence. A failure is now durable
#        and reconsidered regardless of age (S17), the age floor still works
#        when nothing failed (S17b), and a resolved failure leaves the books so
#        the alert can clear (S17c).
#   S18  an obstacle to removal is CLEARED in machine-made harness scratch
#        (S18/S18b, logged because it is a power) and REPORTED rather than
#        overridden in a session's scratchpad (S18c, the bound).
#   S19  THE ALLOCATOR ARM CONSULTS THE OPEN-FILE TABLE. A dead owner pid with a
#        live holder inside is KEPT (S19) and the reason names the holder
#        (S19b); with the holder gone the same tree is deleted (S19c, the
#        control). Reproduced as a real deletion before it was fixed.
#   S20  a tree held ONLY by a test instance of the app is collected rather than
#        kept for ever: the instance is quit (S20b) and the act is logged
#        (S20c). §54 addendum 4 — the instance IS the garbage, and it pins the
#        rest. Any other holder, or a mixed set, still means KEEP (that is S19).
#
#   S21  DENY-BY-DEFAULT OVER $TMPDIR AND THE SHARED TEMP ROOTS. Frank's D1/D2,
#        and they were the absence of a check rather than the defeat of one: a
#        name matching neither declared pattern list was not kept and not
#        deleted, it was never looked at — 56,770 of 60,942 entries. An
#        undeclared name is now swept (S21/S21a) and the CONTROL that matters is
#        S21b/S21c: with the switch declared off the same tree survives and is
#        not even mentioned, which is the old behavior exactly. The keep-list of
#        FOREIGN owners is kept and counted (S21d/S21f) against a non-foreign
#        sibling deleted in the same run (S21e). The PROOF is the process table
#        and not the age (S21g/S21h). A declared shared root is swept too
#        (S21i, which is /private/tmp). Wall 3 stands over the new arm
#        (S21j/S21k) and so does the open-file wall (S21l/S21m). The declared age
#        floor is the SECOND condition and has its own case (S21n-S21p), which is
#        also the case that found a one-hour DST error in lstart_epoch.
#
#   S22  THE GARBAGE ALARM, and a FAILED DELETION THAT REACHES THE EXIT CODE.
#        Frank's verdict was that the mechanism had "a disk-space alarm and a
#        delete-failure alarm" and "no garbage alarm", so garbage nothing would
#        ever collect fell between the two halves of §54 in silence. The verdict
#        line now carries skipped=/skipped_bytes= (S22, control S22b); a failed
#        deletion exits 4 and says failures=N on stdout instead of only in a log
#        (S22c/S22d, control S22e); --apply publishes the numbers the watchdog
#        reads (S22f); and the banner raises the alarm FROM THE LAST FULL PASS,
#        dated, without paying for the expensive arm (S22g-S22i2, control S22j).
#
#   S23  A NAME-DERIVED PID IS ATTRIBUTION, NOT LIVENESS (Frank's D11). He put
#        `1-frank-immortal-b` in the allocator root and the reaper answered "pid 1
#        is ALIVE ... a live owner is kept whatever its TTL says" — forever, at any
#        size, with no alert, and silently by construction because a KEEP is the
#        reaper working as designed. A name-derived pid must now be OURS, above a
#        declared floor, and have started no later than the directory was created
#        (S23/S23c/S23d), while a live pid of ours still keeps its sandbox
#        (S23b, the control that matters) and a LEDGER row stays exempt from the
#        two name-shape tests (S23e). S23f is the second hole in the same family,
#        found by mutant M37: a REUSED LEDGER pid was immortal too, and the code's
#        own comment claimed TTL covered it when TTL never runs after a live KEEP.
#
#   S24  DECLARED CAMPAIGN ROOTS UNDER ~/ab ARE REPORTED, NEVER DELETED (D3). An
#        enumeration rather than a sweep, because the census says 24 of 29
#        directories under ~/ab are in no ledger and most of them are the
#        operator's projects — `fitapp`, `prospects`, `deeply`, `saferecord`. S24e
#        is the case that matters: an UNDECLARED sibling is never nominated.
#   S25  THE VOLUME STAGE (D14), with the age applied by us because
#        `docker volume prune` has no `until` filter — checked against the vendor's
#        reference before it was built. Anonymous only (S25c) and past the declared
#        age only (S25b), which are the two things making it safe.
#   S26  A RUNNING CONTAINER on a declared throwaway image is REPORTED and never
#        stopped (D14). S26d is the control that protects the Buzz production
#        stack: an undeclared image is never nominated, however old.
#
# Exit 0 = every case passed; exit 1 = at least one failed.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE PROCESS NAME IS UNIQUE TO THIS RUN, and that is what makes this suite
# hermetic. The reaper reads the MACHINE-WIDE process table, which is shared
# state: the mutation harness runs eight copies of this suite at once, each
# starting session processes of its own, and under the shared name `claude`
# every run saw the others' processes as unattributed and correctly answered
# INDETERMINATE for everything. Three mutants then scored green against a
# reaper that was deleting nothing — the exact green-for-the-wrong-reason this
# suite exists to refuse, arriving through the suite itself.
#
# SCRATCH_SESSION_PROCESS_NAMES is declared per world, so the shipped code path
# is byte-for-byte the production one and only this run's processes are in it.
#
# A REAL PROCESS — `exec -a "$SUITE_PROC" /bin/sleep`. It is /bin/sleep,
# it is in the process table under that name, it has a genuine start time, and
# it can be killed to make a genuinely dead one. The reaper reads it with the
# same ps call it uses in production and cannot tell it from a session.
#
# TWO EARLIER SHAPES WERE MEASURED AND BOTH LIED:
#   * `cp /bin/sleep $sandbox/claude` — macOS SIGKILLs the copy of a signed
#     platform binary. The process was dead before the reaper looked, which
#     made a liveness test pass for the wrong reason.
#   * `PID=$(start_claude)` — the background job starts inside the command
#     substitution's SUBSHELL, and every KILL_LIST append made there is thrown
#     away with it. The pid came back; the bookkeeping did not.
# The pid is therefore returned in a variable set by the CURRENT shell.

# of 37,146 deletions failed with EPERM. The NEXT run reported ok:true,
# failures:0 with all five directories still on disk — because rmtree had
# removed some children before it hit the unremovable one, THAT UPDATED THE
# DIRECTORY'S MTIME, and the tree came back "touched 1 min ago, inside the 2 h
# legacy floor" and was KEPT. Silently. For two hours.
#
# The reaper's own failure made its next attempt impossible and erased the
# evidence, which under the CEO's rule means garbage that cannot be removed
# produces no alert at all. So a failure is now durable and is retried
# regardless of age.

# S19 — THE ALLOCATOR ARM DOES NOT DELETE A TREE A LIVE PROCESS IS READING
# ===========================================================================
# This was a real defect, found by Frank's attack pass and reproduced here on
# the operator's own machine before it was fixed: the allocator arm was the
# ONLY arm that went from "the owning pid is dead" straight to DELETE without
# consulting the open-file table. Both $TMPDIR arms already checked. Measured
# on the real allocator root, with a dead owner pid in the directory name and a
# live `tail -f` inside:
#
#   DELETE  2.0 MB  .../richos-scratch/99999997-zach-d5-repro
#     why: pid 99999997 is ENDED (owner of 'unrecorded', from the directory
#          name) and nothing has touched this for 374961 min
#
# That is data loss, not garbage collection. The owning pid being dead says the
# ALLOCATION is over; it says nothing about who is reading the tree now.

# S20 — A TEST INSTANCE OF THE APP DOES NOT MAKE ITS OWN GARBAGE IMMORTAL
# ===========================================================================
# §54 addendum 4. The wall S19 adds is correct and it introduces a new way to
# lose: a stray app instance holds its own scratch open, so the tree is KEPT,
# on every run, for ever. That was observed for real while this was being
# written — a fixture app left behind by a killed harness kept its sandbox
# alive, and the sweeper's verdict was KEEP, "a process holds a file open
# inside it", which was correct by the rule and guaranteed the garbage stayed.
#
# So a holder that is POSITIVELY a collectable test instance is quit first and
# the tree removed; ANY other holder still means KEEP (S19 is that case).

# old, pinning 514 MB and 349 MB of image for ever with nothing alerting.
#
# NOTHING IS EVER STOPPED. Four of the six containers on this machine are the Buzz

# --- THE MUTATION HARNESS RUNS FROM THE SUITE IT MUTATES -------------------
# run-all-tests.sh discovers *.test.sh; a *.mutation.sh is invisible to it, and
# eight harnesses in this engine were once run by nothing at all. It matters
# more here than usual: MOST OF THE CASES ABOVE ARE THINGS THAT MUST NOT
# HAPPEN, and every one of them passes against a reaper that deletes nothing.
# The harness is what proves they are not passing for that reason.
#
# ITS FAILURE IS THIS SUITE'S FAILURE, and a MISSING harness is a failure and
# never a skip. RICHOS_MUTATION_INNER is the only thing between this and an
# infinite regress — the harness exports it before running any copy of this
# suite, so never remove one half without the other.
