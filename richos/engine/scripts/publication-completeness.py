"""publication-completeness.py — the analysis behind publication-completeness.sh.

Read that script's header first; it carries the argument for why this contract
exists. This file is the predicate, and nothing else: it takes a publication
root, derives everything it needs from the tree, and prints findings.

The four checks are documented at their own functions below. What they all
share is the derivation rule this engine holds itself to:

    NOTHING HERE IS A TYPED INVENTORY OF CAPABILITIES.

The set of declarations is derived from the shipped source that reads them.
The set of documents is derived from git. The set of onboarding entry points
is derived from README's own link graph. The set of workflows is derived from
the paths GitHub Actions itself discovers. A capability added tomorrow is
checked by the next run with no edit here — which is the only reason this
check can still be true in six months.

Output is one line per finding on stdout, machine-greppable:

    <CHECK>\t<severity>\t<path>\t<message>

Exit codes: 0 no findings, 1 findings, 2 broken (see the .sh wrapper).

# CHECK 1 — REFERENTIAL HONESTY
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Every path a public document cites must resolve IN THE PUBLIC TREE.
#
# This is the cheapest of the four and it caught the loudest defect: a README
# that says "CI runs exactly this on windows-latest
# (.github/workflows/windows-companion-ci.yml)" about a file that exists in no
# repository anywhere. It also caught five citations that dangle for a reason
# worth stating, because it is the exact shape of the CEO's complaint: the
# publication boundary correctly MOVED five documents out to the private
# record, and every reference to them stayed behind. The boundary took the
# wrong things out. Nothing put the references right. A reader with only the
# public repo hits five dead links.
#
# PRECISION IS THE CONTRACT. A checker that fires on everything gets switched
# off, so the extraction was measured against this tree rather than argued:
#
#   naive (any backticked path, any ancestor anchor)          89 findings
#   + anchored only at the citing dir / shipped root / repo root
#   + gitignored targets skipped                              16 findings
#   + engine/reference/ declared as adopter-template prose    11 findings
#
# and all 11 were real. The three narrowing rules are, in order:
#
#   ANCHORED. A citation is a claim about THIS tree only if its first path
#   segment names something that exists in this tree at one of three anchors:
#   the citing file's own directory, its nearest shipped root, or the
#   repository root. `src/lib/Foo.svelte` in an example is not a claim about
#   this tree and is not treated as one. This is what removed 73 of the 89.
#
#   NOT IGNORED. See Tree.ignored().
#
#   NOT DECLARED REFERENCE MATERIAL. engine/reference/'s own README already
#   says, in prose: "Cross-file path references still point at the original
#   layout and will not resolve here — that is expected for reference
#   material." The CITATION_EXEMPT key makes that existing declaration
#   machine-readable. It is not a new license; it is the one already granted.

# CHECK 2 — DECLARATION REACHABILITY  ("shipped inert")
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The engine's guards are switched on by a committed declaration file at the
# governed repository's root: .publication-boundary switches on the boundary
# guards, .ceo-todos switches on the TODOs guard. Presence IS adoption. That
# design is right, and it has a failure mode that is invisible from inside:
#
#   SHIP THE ENFORCEMENT, SHIP THE TESTS, SHIP NO DECLARATION AND NO WORD OF
#   IT ANYWHERE AN ADOPTER READS — AND THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES A GUARD THAT CAN
#   NEVER FIRE.
#
# That is not a hypothetical. On 2026-08-29 the engine shipped
# ceo-todos-lint.sh, guard-ceo-todos-commits.sh, lib/ceo-todos.{sh,py} and a
# full test suite, with no .ceo-todos anywhere, no template of one, and no
# mention in ONBOARDING-RUNBOOK.md, WALKTHROUGH.md or the bootstrap-interview
# skill. Every test passed. The probe was green. The capability was inert.
#
# THE SET OF DECLARATIONS IS DERIVED, NOT LISTED. Each guard names its own
# declaration in its own source, in one form the engine already uses twice:
#
#     : "${PUBLICATION_DECLARATION:=.publication-boundary}"
#     : "${CEO_TODOS_DECLARATION:=.ceo-todos}"
#
# so the set is a grep over shipped source, and a third capability added
# tomorrow is checked the moment it follows the same convention. What that
# does NOT catch is a capability that invents a different convention; see the
# .sh wrapper's "WHAT THIS CANNOT CATCH".
#
# TWO ARMS, because the failure had two halves:
#
#   COPYABLE   Some tracked file is named <D>, <D>.example, <D>.template or
#              <D>.sample — or the repository's own live declaration sits at
#              `<declaration_dir>/<D-without-its-dot>`, which is the same file
#              in the grouped form scripts/lib/declaration-path.sh resolves.
#              Without one, the adopter must reverse-engineer the format out of
#              a parser.
#   ONBOARDED  <D> is named in the ADOPTER'S ENTRY-POINT SET — README.md, the
#              transitive closure of the markdown it links to, and every
#              shipped SKILL.md. Derived from README's own link graph, so it
#              tracks the docs rather than a list of doc names. CHANGELOG.md
#              is not in the closure and must not be: a changelog records that
#              something happened, it does not tell a new adopter to do it.

# CHECK 3 — WORKFLOW REACHABILITY
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GitHub Actions discovers workflows ONLY in `.github/workflows/` at the
# REPOSITORY ROOT. Until 2026-08-29 this repository's only copy of its own
# self-verification lived at engine/.github/workflows/engine-self-verify.yml.
# It was not broken and it was not misconfigured. It had never executed once —
# `gh run list` returned nothing at all — because it sat at a path the runner
# does not look at.
#
# A workflow under a subdirectory is legitimate: it is the ADOPTER'S TEMPLATE,
# and it fires at their root once they vendor the engine there. What is not
# legitimate is that being the ONLY copy, because then the repository shipping
# it has never run the thing it tells the adopter to run.
#
# So the predicate is not "no workflows in subdirectories". It is: whatever a
# subdirectory workflow INVOKES must also be invoked by a workflow at the root.
# Entry points are read out of the YAML's own `run:` lines, so the two copies
# are compared on what they actually do rather than on being byte-identical —
# which they must not be (the root copy carries `working-directory: engine`).

# CHECK 4 — MECHANISM MISPLACEMENT
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The TODOs contract shipped its guard, its lint and its parser to the public
# tree, and left the renderer — the only thing that turns the record into
# something a CEO can look at — in the private HQ repository. The customer got
# the enforcement and not the view.
#
# THE JUDGEMENT CALL IS MECHANISM vs INSTANCE DATA, and it is made
# STRUCTURALLY rather than by opinion:
#
#   INSTANCE DATA  is content. A `.ceo-todos` in the private tree is one
#                  company's declaration; CEO-TODOs.md is one company's TODOs.
#                  Correctly private, and never a candidate here, because
#                  neither has a shebang nor an executable extension.
#
#   MECHANISM      is executable. A shebang, or a .sh/.py/.mjs/.js/.rb/.ps1
#                  extension. render-ceo-todos.mjs is one.
#
# Being a mechanism is not enough — a private repo is allowed its own scripts.
# The defect is a private mechanism COUPLED TO A PUBLIC CONTRACT: it reads or
# writes an artifact whose format is defined by machinery in the public tree,
# i.e. it mentions one of the declaration names Check 2 derived. That is the
# whole test, and it is why normalize-gpt-branch-exports.mjs — a private script
# that couples to nothing public — is not flagged and should not be.
#
# WHERE the private trees are is not guessed: it is read from PRIVATE_SOURCES
# in .publication-boundary, which the operator already maintains for the
# boundary guard. One declaration, two contracts, no second copy to drift.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE EXCUSE TRAVELS WITH THE THING IT EXCUSES
# ===========================================================================
# This is the one property of this check a reader must not get wrong, and it
# was got wrong. `.publication-completeness` carried an INSTANCE_MECHANISMS key
# naming a file inside a private sibling repository, and the result was a gate
# whose verdict on the PUBLIC tree depended on what happened to be sitting next
# to it on disk:
#
#   ON THE MACHINE THAT WROTE THE ENTRY the private root resolved, this check
#   ran, the entry suppressed a real finding, and the gate was green.
#
#   IN A CLONE OF THE PUBLIC REPOSITORY ALONE — every CI runner, every reader,
#   every contributor — no private root resolves, so this check does not run at
#   all. The entry therefore suppressed nothing, and the "an exemption that
#   suppresses nothing FAILS" rule at the bottom of this file fired over a file
#   that is not in the tree being checked.
#
# Both verdicts were sincere and only one of them was about the published tree.
# Note where the asymmetry actually lived: not in a path that failed to
# resolve, but in a CHECK THAT DID NOT RUN while its exemption was still being
# judged. The rule is not at fault and is not weakened here.
#
#       A VERDICT ON THE PUBLISHED TREE MAY NOT DEPEND ON THE OPERATOR'S
#       MACHINE.
#
# So a private mechanism that is one operator's artifact rather than a withheld
# capability now says so ON ITSELF:
#
#       instance-mechanism: <why this is one operator's artifact>
#
# anywhere in its own body. That is the discipline `dialect-exempt: <reason>`
# and `main-checkout-run: <reason>` already use in this engine, for the same
# reason — the declaration sits where the reviewer of that file cannot miss it
# — and a BARE marker with no reason after it exempts nothing.
#
# THE MARKER IS ITSELF CHECKED, so it cannot outlive its justification any more
# than a declaration entry could: a marker on a mechanism that couples to no
# public contract suppresses nothing and is reported as STALE-EXEMPTION, naming
# itself for deletion. That check runs wherever the file exists, which is the
# only place it can mean anything.
#
# WHAT THE PUBLISHED TREE GAINS is a property rather than one fixed instance:
# every key `.publication-completeness` still accepts — CITATION_EXEMPT,
# DECLARATION_EXEMPT, WORKFLOW_EXEMPT — is a function of `git ls-files` and the
# tracked bytes, so its staleness verdict is identical in every clone of that
# tree. There is no key left whose meaning depends on the host, and the retired
# one is refused BY NAME in the wrapper rather than quietly ignored.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXEC_SUFFIXES = (".sh", ".py", ".mjs", ".js", ".rb", ".ps1", ".bash")

# `.worktrees` IS IN HERE FOR A MEASURED REASON, NOT FOR TIDINESS. An agent
# working under `isolation: "worktree"` gets a full second copy of the private
# tree at `<private-root>/.worktrees/<branch>/`. Every declared mechanism in it
# then appears at a SECOND path that no `.publication-completeness` entry names
# — so the checker reports a MISPLACED finding for a file that is already
# exempt at its real path, and `guard-completeness-commits.sh` refuses EVERY
# commit in the public repository until that agent's worktree goes away.
#
# Measured 2026-09-01: one isolated worktree inside the private tree re-reported
# an already-excused mechanism and blocked an unrelated commit in the public
# repository. Declaring the copy would have been worse than useless: it names an
# ephemeral path, and the "an entry that suppresses nothing FAILS" rule would
# then have fired the moment the worktree was reaped. Under the marker the copy
# carries the marker too, so it is excused either way — the skip still earns
# its place by keeping one file from being reported twice.

# A worktree is a checkout of content that is already being walked at its
