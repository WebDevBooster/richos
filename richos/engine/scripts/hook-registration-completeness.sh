# hook-registration-completeness.sh — THE PREDICATE: is a newly registered hook
#                                      named in every inventory that has to
#                                      carry it?
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
# ===========================================================================
# On 2026-09-14 CI went red on FIVE units at once, on `main`, and every one of
# them was self-inflicted by the same night's landings. Three hooks landed
# within two hours — handoff-facts-annotate.sh, notice-protected-ref-moves.sh,
# ref-transaction-forensics.sh. Each was correctly registered in
# hooks/hooks.json. Each was missing from a DIFFERENT subset of the other
# inventories that other suites assert against. Three competent engineers hit
# it independently the same night. The record is
# richos-hq/docs/verification/lifecycle-failure-record-2026-09-13.md §10h,
# type X.
#
# The reason all three got it wrong is not carelessness and it is worth being
# precise about, because it decides where the fix has to sit:
#
#   THE REGISTRATION WORKS THE MOMENT hooks.json HAS IT. The hook loads, fires,
#   and does its job. NOTHING IS BROKEN FROM THE AUTHOR'S SEAT. The inventories
#   are assertions made by OTHER suites about a set the author never sees, and
#   the only thing that tells anybody is CI — after the land, on `main`.
#
# So the check has to fire when the registration is WRITTEN. That is
# scripts/hooks/guard-hook-registration-commits.sh; this file is the predicate
# it runs, kept separate for the reason guard-completeness-commits.sh keeps
# its own: ONE PREDICATE, MANY CALLERS. A hook-shaped reimplementation beside a
# CI-shaped one is the defect class this engine keeps finding in itself.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE INVENTORY LIST IS DERIVED, NOT TYPED — AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN
# ===========================================================================
# The obvious implementation is a list: "add your hook to these five files".
# It was rejected, and the reason is the failure record's own sentence:
#
#   "satisfying one requirement means editing an unknown number of unrelated
#    files, and NOTHING ENUMERATES THEM."
#
# A typed list in here would be an N+1th copy of that unknown number, drifting
# the day somebody adds a sixth inventory — which is the SAME defect one level
# up, and this engine has already watched a typed guard count go stale twice in
# two days (13/13 and 14/14 over a wired, firing guard). See
# scripts/lib/registered-hooks.sh for that story.
#
# So the inventories are derived from the tree, by UNANIMITY:
#
#   A FILE THAT NAMES EVERY ONE OF THE OTHER REGISTERED HOOKS IS, BY
#   CONSTRUCTION, AN INVENTORY OF REGISTERED HOOKS.
#
# That predicate is binary — a basename is in a file or it is not — and it
# needs no threshold, no reading of intent, and no guess about what a file is
# for. Measured on richos @ f5babcb7, 68 registered hook scripts, 674 tracked
# files in engine/:
#
#   68/68  hooks/hooks.json                          <- the registration itself
#   68/68  .claude/settings.local.json               <- hook-staleness case 11
#   68/68  scripts/hooks/contract-integrity-probe.sh <- by-reference BR2
#   68/68  scripts/hooks/engine-status.test.sh       <- engine-status case 1b
#
# OF THOSE FOUR, ONLY TWO ARE STILL TYPED BY A HUMAN. The first is the
# registration, which is the trigger rather than a demand. The second is
# GENERATED from the first by install.sh since 2026-09-15, so its demand is
# satisfied by running a command; the reader stays because the generated file
# is committed and a commit made without running the generator still reaches
# `main` with the surfaces disagreeing. The remaining two are typed on purpose
# and deriving them is a different piece of work (contract-integrity-probe.sh
# L393-402 argues why BR_EXPECTED must NOT be derived: a table derived from the
# thing it checks asserts nothing). Anyone reading this to size a retirement of
# the guard above should start there and not here.
#   ----------------------------------------- unanimity cliff -----------
#   41/68  scripts/hooks/contract-integrity.test.sh
#   41/68  README.md
#   33/68  CHANGELOG.md
#   20/68  scripts/hooks/install.sh
#
# Four files reach unanimity and the next candidate is 27 hits below them. The
# derivation reproduces, with no typed list, exactly the four places a hand
# audit found — and it reproduces the two NEGATIVE findings as well, which is
# the better evidence:
#
#   * README.md is NOT an inventory. Its table is per-SYSTEM, not per-hook, so
#     it lands at 41/68 and is never demanded. Asserting that by hand was a
#     call somebody made; here it is a measurement.
#   * install.sh is NOT an inventory. Its hashed set used to be sixteen typed
#     paths and is now DERIVED from hooks.json (see its own header: "wiring a
#     seventeenth guard mints its sidecar with no edit here"), so it names only
#     the 20 hooks its prose happens to discuss, and demanding membership would
#     be demanding a pointless edit.
#
# When a sixth inventory is added, this predicate picks it up on the run after
# the one that made it unanimous. Nothing here has to be told.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT IS STILL TYPED, AND WHY THAT IS SAFE
# ===========================================================================
# Unanimity is a FILE-level test, and two of the four inventories hold their
# membership in a specific STRUCTURE inside the file. A hook named only in a
# prose comment in contract-integrity-probe.sh would satisfy a substring test
# and leave BR2 red — a green tick over the exact failure this exists to catch.
#
# So three structural readers are typed (the BR_EXPECTED table, the
# ACKNOWLEDGED_SCRIPTS heredoc, the settings.local.json command list), and the
# typing is made safe by being CHECKED AGAINST THE DERIVATION: every typed
# reader must name a file the unanimity pass independently found. If one of
# them ever stops being an inventory, this predicate says so and fails rather
# than going on quietly asserting against a file nobody enforces any more. A
# typed list that cannot notice its own staleness is the thing being replaced;
# a typed list that is re-proved against a derivation on every run is not.
#
# A file that reaches unanimity and has NO structural reader gets the substring
# test. That is the weaker check, and it is the right weaker check: it is what
# can be said about a file whose shape is not known, and it still catches the
# whole of the failure class — a name that is nowhere in the file.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE CONDITIONAL INVENTORIES, AND WHY GETTING THIS WRONG IS WORSE THAN NOTHING
# ===========================================================================
# Two inventories are conditional on a property of the hook, and demanding them
# unconditionally would force an engineer to WRITE SOMETHING FALSE:
#
#   R_ROOTLESS_HOOKS (contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R) — only for a hook
#     that does NOT source scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. INVERTED 2026-09-14
#     with Layer R itself: that layer used to hold a typed R_ROOTED_HOOKS and
#     walk only the hooks it named, which let five rooted hooks accumulate
#     unchecked, one of them already carrying a divergent bootstrap. It now
#     DERIVES the hooks it walks from hooks/hooks.json, so a rooted hook owes
#     this file nothing and a rootless one must declare itself or fail R2 for
#     not sourcing a library it has no reason to source. The condition is still
#     tested with the SAME grep Layer R itself uses.
#
#     handoff-facts-annotate.sh is a live instance. notice-protected-ref-moves.sh
#     was named here as a second one and that was WRONG — measured 2026-09-14, it
#     both sources resolve-roots.sh and assigns ENGINE_ROOT, and it has been in
#     the rooted set the whole time. The same sentence is repeated in
#     engine-status.test.sh's comment above ACKNOWLEDGED_SCRIPTS; it is wrong
#     there too.
#
# That leaves ONE conditional inventory. There were two until 2026-09-14:
#
#   CANONICAL_AGENT_CHAIN (contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer C) — GONE, and its
#     removal is the reason this paragraph is worth reading. It was an ORDERED
#     typed chain that an Agent-matcher hook had to be added to by hand, in the
#     right position, and this file dutifully DEMANDED it: the ninth Agent hook's
#     report named it as one of four owed places. A demand is the right answer
#     to a list that must exist. It is the wrong answer to a list that should
#     not. That chain is now derived from hooks/hooks.json through
#     scripts/lib/registered-hooks.sh, so the registration IS the entry and
#     there is nothing left to owe — the only demand this file can make of a
#     tenth Agent hook is the one it makes of every hook.
#
# The surviving condition is read off the artifacts (the hook's own source),
# never off intent.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHECK
# ===========================================================================
# REMOVALS. A hook that leaves hooks.json has to leave the same inventories,
# and that is genuinely half of this rule — but the only available test, "no
# inventory still names it", has a real false-positive class: this engine's
# inventories carry PROSE that names removed hooks on purpose.
# engine-status.test.sh's own comment names record-subagent-start.sh,
# terminalize-agent-worktrees.sh, session-start-reap-worktrees.sh and
# notice-land-disposition.sh, all four removed on 2026-09-11, all four
# correctly still written down. A blocking check would refuse that comment.
# Since the whole argument for blocking here is that the predicate is
# unambiguous with no prose false-positives, the removal half does not qualify
# and is left to engine-status case 1b, which catches it on the next CI run.
# This is disclosed rather than quietly scoped: the rule is enforced in one
# direction and that direction is named.
#
# LAYER M's double-registration list (CANON) and README.md's guard table. No
# suite asserts membership of either, so demanding them would be enforcing a
# preference while calling it a contract. They are printed as ADVICE when a
# registration adds a Bash-matcher hook, and they never block.
#
# A NEW INVENTORY'S FIRST HOOK. A file becomes unanimous only once it names
# every registered hook; the commit that CREATES an inventory is therefore not
# checked against itself. That is correct and not a gap: until it is unanimous
# it is not yet an inventory of anything.
