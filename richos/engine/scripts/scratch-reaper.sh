# scratch-reaper.sh — SCRATCH NOBODY IS USING GETS DELETED ON A SCHEDULE, AND
#                     EVERY DELETION IS ON THE RECORD.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE MORNING THIS EXISTS FOR
# ===========================================================================
# 2026-09-17. macOS said "Your disk is almost full". `df -h /` showed 1.8 GB
# free of 460 GB. 19 GB of scratch came back — three finished sessions'
# scratchpads, one session's build and bisect leftovers, a stale build cache —
# because a person read the warning and deleted them BY HAND.
#
# The CEO, that morning: "There needs to be a mechanism to make sure that
# scratch directories get deleted on a regular basis. I don't want piles of
# garbage to pile up endlessly."
#
# The failure was never the garbage. It was that reclaiming it took a warning
# and a person, which means on the day nobody is at the machine it does not
# happen at all.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT IT DOES, AND THE ONE THING IT WILL NOT DO
# ===========================================================================
# Deletes, only ever after PROVING nobody owns it (scripts/lib/scratch-reaper.py
# carries the proof and the four walls):
#
#   * a finished session's Claude scratchpad and tasks
#   * the empty scratch root a finished session leaves behind
#   * a file in a scratch root that no running session can have written
#   * a harness temp workspace under $TMPDIR that no process holds open
#   * nightly build products beyond the declared retention
#
# It will not delete anything a live session owns, any registered workspace,
# anything containing a .git, ~/RichOS, ~/.richos-signing, the nightly source
# worktree or its runtime. MEASURED on the morning it was written: the single
# biggest pile on the machine, 4.27 GB, belonged to the session that was
# RUNNING — so this program would not have prevented that disk-full warning,
# and saying so is worth more than a claim that it would.
#
# ===========================================================================
# USAGE
# ===========================================================================
#   scratch-reaper.sh                 the plan. DELETES NOTHING.
#   scratch-reaper.sh --verbose       the plan including every KEEP and why
#   scratch-reaper.sh --apply         delete, and write the log
#   scratch-reaper.sh --json          the plan as a record
#   scratch-reaper.sh --notice        one line, only if the declared threshold
#                                     of reclaimable scratch is exceeded
#   scratch-reaper.sh --install       schedule it (launchd, every 6 hours)
#   scratch-reaper.sh --uninstall     unschedule it
#
# NOT DELETING IS THE DEFAULT, and that is deliberate: a program whose safe
# mode needs a flag is a program that deletes the first time somebody types it
# wrong. `--dry-run` is accepted and means the default.
#
# The plan printed by --apply is byte-identical to the plan printed without it,
# plus one final `applied:` line. The scan happens before any deletion and the
# report carries no timestamp, so the two can be diffed — which is how the
# test proves that --apply decides nothing --dry-run did not show.
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0  every candidate was decided and nothing failed to delete
#   2  a threshold is not declared, or the liveness primitive is missing
#   3  something was UNDECIDABLE — a running process that no session file
#      names, a wall that tripped. Undecidable is a failure, never a footnote
#      beside a success-shaped count, which is the rule the worktree reaper
#      learned the same way.
#   4  A DELETION FAILED. Added 2026-09-18: it used to be `3 if undecidable
#      else 0`, with the failure list never consulted, so a run in which every
#      deletion failed printed `applied: deleted=0 freed=0 B` — the same shape
#      as a run with nothing to do — and handed launchd a green exit. The word
#      FAILED existed only inside a log file nobody reads. 4 outranks 3 because
#      a failed deletion is the branch of §54 where Rich deletes it by hand.
#
# ===========================================================================
# EVERY THRESHOLD IS DECLARED. NONE IS A DEFAULT.
# ===========================================================================
# Cadence, age floor, retention and notice threshold are SCRATCH_* in
# orchestration.config, each with the measurement that chose it. This script
# reads the ENGINE's own orchestration.config — it runs from launchd with no
# repository and no session, so there is no entity root to resolve, and a job
# whose configuration depended on where it was started from would behave
# differently at 04:40 than it did when somebody tested it by hand.
