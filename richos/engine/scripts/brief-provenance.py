"""brief-provenance.py — separate what a brief CITES from what it merely ASSERTS, and
tell the agent which is which, before the agent builds on either.

===========================================================================================
WHAT THIS IS FOR — type W, richos-hq docs/verification/lifecycle-failure-record-2026-09-13.md
===========================================================================================
The CEO, 2026-09-14:

    "That's not a 'hand-off'. That's a BRIEF to a newly spawned agent. A BRIEF that
     contains shitloads of not just unnecessary garbage but factually wrong and harmful
     garbage."

The brief that spawned `zach-opus-n3` carried roughly fourteen load-bearing statements: six
verified quotations, four unverified narratives asserted as observed fact, two factually
wrong, one distorted quotation, and two prescriptions built on an architecture the author had
read one code comment of.

`CLAUDE.md` already carries the rule — *"A NUMBER IN A BRIEF CARRIES THE COMMAND THAT PRODUCED
IT, OR IT CARRIES THE WORD UNVERIFIED. There is no third setting."* It was broken by its own
author one turn after he wrote up its sibling failure. The same page records a DELIBERATE
decision not to enforce it with a hook, because a blocking guard over prose has a large
false-positive class and habitual waiving kills a guard. That reasoning is sound and this file
does not overturn it.

===========================================================================================
THE ONE IDEA
===========================================================================================
THIS DOES NOT JUDGE WHETHER A CLAIM IS TRUE, AND IT NEVER REFUSES A SPAWN. It separates the
statements that carry a source from the statements that do not, and it hands that separation
to the READER WHO IS HARMED BY IT — the agent.

`CLAUDE.md` supplies the evidence that this works, from the day the rule was written:

    "The marked form works and I know it works: three times that day I wrote 'confirm this
     yourself, I derived it with a two-condition grep', and all three times the agent
     re-derived it and was right."

Marking worked 3/3. It failed only because it was applied by hand, by the one person who
cannot see his own recollection as a recollection. So the mark is generated instead.

WHY NON-BLOCKING IS NOT A WEAKER VERSION OF BLOCKING. A blocking guard over prose dies the way
g11/g12/g13 died: false positive -> waive -> habitual waive -> dead guard. This has no waiver
to grant. A false positive costs the agent one re-derivation of a fact that turns out to be
true, which is the cheapest possible failure and leaves no habit behind. That asymmetry, not
optimism about precision, is what makes the non-blocking form viable where the blocking form
was rejected.

===========================================================================================
THE FIVE CHECKS, IN DESCENDING ORDER OF SOUNDNESS — and the order is the honest part
===========================================================================================
1. QUOTATION (exact, no judgment, no false positives). A blockquote presented as coming from
   a file is searched for in that file, byte for byte modulo whitespace. Either the string is
   there or it is not. This is the only check that can prove a defect rather than name a
   risk. It catches the distorted quotation.

2. RESTATEMENT (structural). A prose reference to a numbered point of a document the brief
   itself names — "Point 5 then guarantees...", "Point 7: both endings delete" — is a
   PARAPHRASE of a citable source. The record's own words: "every paraphrase is a fresh
   surface for distortion - one of them distorted. A brief that says *read points 4, 5, 7 and
   11 of <path>* carries the same authority and cannot drift from it."

3. PROVENANCE (heuristic, and noisy). A statement is listed when it carries a COUNT, an
   assertion of CERTAINTY, or a claim about the BEHAVIOR OF A NAMED CODE ENTITY, and no command,
   captured output, commit, file:line or re-derive instruction sits in scope with it.

4. CAPABILITY (heuristic, and the noisiest — added for type Y, §10i of the same record). The
   MIRROR IMAGE of check 3: it looks only at statements that DO carry a source, and asks whether
   the source is the KIND of thing that could establish the sentence's verb. A state measurement
   answers what IS; it never answers who did it, when, whether it was allowed, or which of
   several candidates it was. `git branch --no-merged` returning one branch was reported to the
   CEO as "all but one are fully merged into main", and merged names an act somebody performed.
   Re-running the command CONFIRMS the number, which is why checks 1-3 are blind to this by
   construction rather than by oversight.

   MEASURED, so the noise is not a matter of opinion: over this session's 23 spawn payloads it
   adds 1 row (against 140 from checks 1-3), and over 63 landed records it adds 37 (against
   1743). Of those 37, eight are real, six are arguable and 23 are false positives — a 62% false
   positive rate, which is survivable ONLY in the non-blocking shape and would be fatal in a
   guard. The eight include all three sentences of the one record in that corpus later PROVEN
   false by another agent, at the cost of an escalation and a published correction.

5. SELECTOR BLINDNESS (heuristic; the narrowest of the five and the one with the oldest rule
   behind it — added 2026-09-14 for the three instances of one night). A NEGATIVE-EXISTENCE
   claim resting on a search. `grep "git init"` returned one hit, THE COMMENT MAKING THE CLAIM,
   and the brief said the suite builds no repositories; it had built them all along, spelled
   `git -C "$root" init -q -b main`. The rule is this project's own, written 2026-05-08 for
   TESTS (`feedback_negative_tests_pass_for_wrong_reason.md`) and never pointed at claims until
   now: a negative result cannot tell "the thing is absent" from "the check could not see it."

   THE LINE, because a check that fires on every negative claim dies in a week. A CENSUS
   (`git status`, `ls`) enumerates its domain, so empty output IS absence. A SELECTOR SEARCH
   puts an author-written pattern in front of the domain, and only that can be blind. Then the
   discriminator: the claim is flagged only when the SENTENCE DOES NOT NAME THE PATTERN — a
   sentence about the string is grep's own question, and grep answers it exactly.

   TWO ENTRY BRANCHES, because the instance as retold and the instance as SHIPPED are not the
   same. (a) the search is cited and the sentence is about something wider. (b) no search is
   cited at all and a QUOTED LITERAL is asserted absent — which is the flagship instance: the
   brief relayed a conclusion, the search happened in the lead's head, and a claim that a
   string is absent is a search result whether or not anybody shows the search.

   MEASURED on the surface it is delivered on: 4 rows over 30 real briefs (3 real, 1 the known
   mention-versus-use false positive), 6 over 31 spawn payloads. Over the 65-document records
   corpus it would be 31 against checks 1-4's 1862, which is why it is not wired into the
   record-write hook; that hook is check 4 only by its own measured decision.

WHAT THIS CANNOT DO, STATED HERE SO IT IS NOT DISCOVERED LATER:
  - It cannot tell a true account from a false one. Nothing textual can.
  - Check 4 cannot tell MENTION from USE. A document about the word "merged" is flagged for
    containing it; test case Y11 asserts that failure out loud rather than hiding it.
  - Check 4 only speaks about commands in its own table. An unrecognized command yields nothing,
    which is deliberate: the table is an allowlist of capabilities somebody wrote down, not a
    guess about every program on the machine.
  - It cannot catch a bare prescription that names no code entity — "do not build a second
    reaper". That sentence is formally identical to a legitimate constraint ("do not weaken
    the guard"), which good briefs carry. It catches such a prescription only through the
    account it rests on, which is usually in the same sentence and usually is caught.
  - Check 5 cannot see a negative claim that names neither a search nor a literal. "The suite
    builds no repositories", relayed with nothing beside it, has no surface to recognize; test
    case S7b asserts that out loud.
  - NOTHING HERE TOUCHES MISREADING. A command that ran, whose output was pasted, and whose
    output was read wrong — indented log lines taken for top-level failures — produces a brief
    with a real command, a real output and a false sentence, and every check above is satisfied
    by it. That failure has a second reader as its only defense.
  - It cannot make the lead read its output. It does not need to: the annotation reaches the
    agent whether or not the lead reads a word of it.

===========================================================================================
SCOPE OF EVIDENCE — why "in scope" is the block, not the sentence
===========================================================================================
A brief that pastes a grep and then says "21 other sites" has sourced the 21. Evidence
therefore counts for a whole block (a paragraph, a list item, a table) and for a code block
directly adjacent to it. It does NOT count across a heading: a command in the problem
statement does not source a claim three sections later. That is the same scoping the
re-derive instruction gets, and it is what stops one "do not assume" at the bottom of a page
exempting everything above it.

# CHECK 4 — CAPABILITY: the citation is real, and it does not establish the verb
#
# Type Y, richos-hq docs/verification/lifecycle-failure-record-2026-09-13.md §10i.
# Checks 1-3 ask whether a statement HAS a source. This one only ever looks at
# statements that DO, which is why it is not a stricter version of check 3 but its
# complement: check 3 fires when nothing in scope sources a sentence, check 4 fires
# only when something does. The two populations are disjoint by construction.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not decide whether the sentence is true, and it does
# not decide entailment. It states what the CITED COMMAND is capable of establishing
# and what the SENTENCE asserts, and leaves the comparison to the reader. That is
# deliberate: a capability statement about `git branch --no-merged` has no truth value
# to get wrong, so this check cannot produce a false ACCUSATION. It can only produce
# an UNNECESSARY row, and the rate of those is the thing measured on the real corpus.
#
# THREE RULES, and they are three because the corpus is not one shape. §10i proposes a
# single tell - "if the sentence has an actor in it, the command must have found the
# actor". Instance 2 of its own four has no actor: a count of rows ever addressed to
# the CEO was given the name outstanding. That is a SCOPE mismatch, not an actor one,
# and an actor detector is blind to it.
#
#   A1  AUTHORITY and EXPECTATION are universally unestablishable. No shell command
#       reports whether something was allowed, or whose action is awaited. This rule
#       needs no table and does not even need a command: ANY cited evidence plus such
#       a predicate is a mismatch.
#   A2  ACT, AGENT, TIME and IDENTITY are table-driven, because whether a command can
#       carry them depends on the command. `git reflog` DOES record operations;
#       `git branch --no-merged` does not. Firing on the word alone would flag the
#       correct usage, and a check that cannot tell the two apart teaches its reader
#       to skip it.
#   B   A COUNT'S NAME MUST BE DERIVABLE FROM ITS SELECTOR. Purely lexical: if the
#       sentence calls a count `outstanding` and the command that produced it contains
#       no word to that effect, the count may carry a filter that was never applied.
#       This is the only rule that catches instance 2.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What a command establishes, and the classes of claim it cannot carry. FIRST MATCH
# WINS, so the specific forms precede the general ones. A command that is not in this
# table produces NO finding under A2 - the table is an allowlist of things we can state
# a capability for, not a denylist, and that is what keeps the rate low.

# CHECK 5 — SELECTOR BLINDNESS: a negative claim resting on a search for ONE SPELLING
#
# THE RULE THIS MOVES. `feedback_negative_tests_pass_for_wrong_reason.md`, 2026-05-08,
# four months before this check and never pointed anywhere but at tests: a negative
# result cannot distinguish "the thing is absent" from "THE CHECK COULD NOT SEE IT."
# Its remedy there is a positive-shape probe. This is the same finding moved from
# tests to CLAIMS, and the remedy does NOT move with it — see below.
#
# THE THREE INSTANCES IT IS BUILT FROM, one night, each becoming a briefed premise:
#
#   `grep "git init" contract-integrity.test.sh`  -> 1 hit, THE COMMENT MAKING THE CLAIM
#       claimed: "the suite builds no repositories"
#       truth:   it had built them all along, spelled `git -C "$root" init -q -b main`
#   `grep -rn "ALREADY ACKED 26 TIME" engine/`    -> 0 hits
#       claimed: "the guard does not log its own usage"
#       truth:   guard-ci-red-lands.sh prints it from a `%d` template; the rendered
#                form with a number in it cannot appear in the source that renders it
#   a count of a typed list                       -> 53
#       claimed: "53 files carry the bootstrap"    truth: 60 do; 53 was A LIST'S LENGTH
#
# WHERE THE LINE IS, and getting it wrong is what kills a check like this. "The working
# tree is clean" also rests on a search that found nothing, and it is fine. The
# difference is not the emptiness:
#
#   A CENSUS enumerates its domain. `git status`, `ls`, `git branch` -- nothing the
#   author wrote stands between the domain and the answer, so an empty output IS the
#   absence.
#
#   A SELECTOR SEARCH puts an author-written pattern between the domain and the answer.
#   `grep PATTERN`, `find -name PATTERN`. An empty output is then ambiguous between the
#   thing being absent and the pattern not matching its spelling, and no exit code and
#   no re-run can tell the two apart.
#
# THAT ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH, and the second condition does the discriminating work.
# "`freshness-check.sh` is not referenced in the deploy scripts", sourced by a grep for
# `freshness-check`, is a sentence ABOUT THE STRING, and grep answers exactly that
# question. What went wrong in all three instances is a TRANSLATION from a string to a
# CONCEPT -- repositories, logging, carrying the bootstrap -- performed silently between
# the command and the sentence. So:
#
#   FLAG = a negative-existence claim + a selector search in scope + THE SENTENCE DOES
#          NOT NAME THE PATTERN THAT WAS SEARCHED.
#
# In instance 1 that lands exactly where the harm was: "`git init` appears nowhere in
# this file" names the pattern and is SILENT (it is true, and it is grep's own
# question); "the suite builds no repositories" does not, and is flagged. The second
# sentence is the one that misled the engineer.
#
# WHY "DID THE SEARCH RETURN NOTHING?" IS NOT A CONDITION, though it is the obvious one
# and the brief that commissioned this asked for it. It is not detectable -- a brief
# quotes a command and rarely its output -- and it is NOT NEEDED: instance 1's search
# returned a hit and was just as wrong. The negative claim lives in the brief's own
# prose, which is always there. The emptiness was never the signal.
#
# WHY NOT THE POSITIVE CONTROL, which is what the 2026-05-08 rule literally prescribes.
# Measured against the three, a control pairing (cite a second search of the same shape
# that DOES find something) catches NONE. Instance 1's own search found something, so
# the control is self-satisfying and adds no row. Instance 2's control would prove the
# path readable, which it was, and the pattern would still be a rendering of a template.
# Instance 3 has no search at all. A control proves the PLUMBING; every one of these
# failed at the SELECTOR. What actually recovers instances 1 and 2 is a strictly WEAKER
# selector -- `init -q` finds line 1621, `ALREADY ACKED` finds the print -- and "weaker"
# is a direction a person chooses, not a property two strings have. It also is not free:
# broadening instance 1 all the way to `init` returns 51 lines, most of them the word
# "definition". So the check NAMES the discipline and does not pretend to verify it,
# which is this file's shape everywhere else.

BODY = """The statements below were written by your orchestrator without a command, a commit,
a captured output or a file:line beside them. They are its ACCOUNT of the system, and an
account is a recollection until you check it. Nothing here says any of them is wrong.

**Re-derive any of them you are about to build on, and say what you found.** If one of them is
the reason for an approach this brief prescribes, treat the approach as a hypothesis and not as
a constraint: a prescription resting on an unchecked account has already chosen your design for
you. If the code contradicts it, that is a finding — report it and stop rather than forcing the
brief's shape onto what is actually there."""


# The capability rows are the OPPOSITE finding to the other three, so they cannot sit
# under a heading that says "no source". They need their own instruction, because the
# right response to them is not "go and re-run it" — re-running it CONFIRMS the number,
# which is precisely how all four instances of this failure survived.
CAPABILITY_LEAD = """These are not unsourced. The command was run, the output is real, and
re-running it will agree with the number — that is why they are listed apart. **What is in
question is the WORD, not the measurement.** A command reports what IS; none of them reports
who did a thing, when, whether it was allowed, or which of several candidates it was.

**Before you build on one of these, decide which you actually need.** If you need the
measurement, it is there and it is good. If you need the claim — that somebody did something,
that it was authorized, that a particular one of them is the one — then this source does not
carry it, and neither does re-running it: you need different evidence, or the honest answer
that the record cannot settle it."""


# Selector rows need a third instruction again, and for a third reason. Check 3 says
# GO AND DERIVE IT. Check 4 says the number is fine and the WORD is not, so do not
# bother re-deriving. This one says the command is fine, the word may be fine, and the
# QUESTION PUT TO THE COMMAND was narrower than the sentence — so the response is
# neither re-run nor find other evidence: it is BROADEN, and look at what comes back.
SELECTOR_LEAD = """Every sentence below says something is NOT THERE, and rests on a search —
shown or unshown — to say it. **The search is not in question; what it was ASKED is.** A search
answers about the STRING you gave it, in the FILES you pointed it at. Where the command is shown,
the sentence is about something wider than that string and does not name it, so a translation
happened between the two that nobody checked. Where no command is shown, the search still happened
— nobody learns that a string is absent by any other means — and the brief has not said what it was.

**Re-running the search is zero defense. It will agree with itself.** The rule that applies is this
project's own, written on 2026-05-08 for tests and never pointed at claims until now
(`feedback_negative_tests_pass_for_wrong_reason.md`): a negative result cannot tell *the thing is
absent* from *the check could not see it*.

**So before you build on one: BROADEN the pattern until it returns hits, and READ them.** `CLAUDE.md`
— *"A value has more than one spelling ... Grep for the thing, not for one of its forms."* The
instance that forced this row into existence: a two-word search returned exactly one hit, the comment
making the claim, while the suite it denied had been building real repositories all along under a
spelling those two words cannot match."""
