# spawn.test.sh — behavioral tests for scripts/spawn.sh, the one command that
# starts one teammate (docs/plans/worktree-spec-2026-09-11.md; the reason it
# exists is in scripts/lib/spawn.py's header).
#
# WHAT IS PINNED, AND WHY. HOME, CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, the workspace registry and
# the session identity all live in the sandbox, and the session is a process of
# this suite's own, so no case can touch the operator's record. The hook
# surfaces are pinned too (RICHOS_SPAWN_HOOK_SOURCES): the point of these cases
# is what spawn.sh does with a verdict, not which verdicts the machine's live
# CEO-todo state happens to produce today. The REAL guard-worktree-isolation.sh
# is in the pinned set, because clauses 4c and 7 are half of what is under test.
#
# Three cases are deliberately NOT hermetic (REAL SURFACES): they assert that
# the collector finds a guard from the engine's matcherless group AND one from a
# governed repository's settings.local.json, and that femcboost's brief-scope
# guard reports both of its rules at once. Reading only the engine's Agent group
# is the exact hole that cost two refusals on 2026-09-13, and a hermetic fixture
# cannot prove it is closed on this machine.
#
# TWO OF THOSE THREE NEED A WORKSTATION THAT NO CI RUNNER CAN BE, so each judges
# its OWN surface and SKIPS with its reason printed when that surface is absent
# — see the block itself for what that cost before it did. The engine-side one
# needs nothing but this repository and runs everywhere.
#
# Run directly: scripts/spawn.test.sh
# Exit 0 = every case that could run passed; exit 1 = at least one failure.
# A SKIP is neither: it is counted and listed separately, and never as a pass.

#
# Until 2026-09-14 all three sat inside ONE `if` on
# $REAL_PROJECT/.claude/settings.local.json, so on a GitHub runner — where that
# governed checkout cannot exist — the whole block collapsed to a single line,
# "FAIL REAL-SURFACES could not run" (run 34787626046, shard 5/12, ubuntu-24.04,
# 29 passed 1 failed; the same commit is 32/32 on the operator's machine, and
# `RICHOS_SPAWN_TEST_REAL_PROJECT=/tmp/definitely-not-here` reproduces the
# runner's output here byte for byte). Nothing about spawn.sh was wrong. A red
# that only means "this runner is not that workstation" is a red nobody can act
# on, and it teaches everyone to read past the next one.
#
# The fix is NOT to drop the assertions. One of the three needs no workstation
# at all, and the two that do are exactly the ones that must print WHY they did
# not run:
#
#   1. the engine's own hooks/hooks.json — ships IN this repository, so it runs
#      everywhere, runner included, and stays load-bearing in CI. Reading only
#      the Agent-matched group and missing the matcherless one is the hole that
#      cost two refusals on 2026-09-13; this is the case that keeps it closed.
#   2. a governed repository's .claude/settings.local.json — a property of a
#      workstation. Synthesizing one proves nothing the hermetic refuse-b.sh
#      case above has not already proved against a fixture.
#   3. femcboost's guard-brief-verification-scope.sh — the same.
#
# A case that cannot run here SKIPs, with its reason on the line under it and
# repeated in the summary, and is never counted as a pass. Same discipline as
# the workflow's `ci-skip:` declaration and the probe's BY-REFERENCE layers:
# an undeclared skip is a finding.
