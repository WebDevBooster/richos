# operator-fences.mutation.sh: PROVES operator-fences.test.sh WOULD CATCH EACH
# RULE OF THE LEASE, THE FENCE AND THE SWITCH GOING WRONG.
#
# Each mutant removes ONE property from a throwaway copy of the engine and demands
# that the NAMED case go red. The loop is scripts/lib/mutation-harness.sh; the
# suite is run with stop-at-want (its cases share state and a printed FAIL line
# always ends it red), under ONE git, the first of OPERATOR_FENCES_MUTATION_GIT
# (default Homebrew, else Apple), because the suite's second git doubles the time
# of every mutant and proves nothing a mutant is about.
#
# WHAT HAS NO MUTANT HERE, AND WHY:
#   F5, F6, F8, F16's positive halves, F24 and F23 are the passes the refusals
#   are measured against; a mutant that makes a pass fail is a mutant of the
#   fixture, not of a rule.
#   F3L and F12L assert Git's own behavior, not ours.
#   The early check, the turn-end release, the supervisor's reaping and the
#   lease-aware unfinished-land guard have their own suites and harnesses:
#   scripts/hooks/land-lease-commands.mutation.sh,
#   scripts/hooks/release-land-leases.mutation.sh,
#   scripts/lib/provider-supervisor.mutation.sh, and femcboost's
#   scripts/hooks/guard-unfinished-land.mutation.sh.
#
# Run directly: scripts/operator-fences.mutation.sh
# Exit 0 = every property is proven load-bearing.
