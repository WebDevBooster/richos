# review-watch.sh: the second review starts by itself, with nobody asking.
#
# On 2026-10-08 the CEO fetched a Codex review of an agent's work by hand four
# times, and each one found defects the author's own tests had passed. His
# words (ruling §113): "A regular RichOS user can never be expected anything
# even remotely close to that. So, this all must be completely automated."
# second-review.sh does one review (slice 1); this watcher starts it (slice 2
# of richos-hq docs/plans/2026-10-09-automatic-second-review-and-t3-ideas.md):
# at every teammate handover, every hour of a long job, when a teammate goes
# quiet, and at each Codex READY entry. It is started by Claude Code itself
# with every interactive session: the engine's plugin monitor
# (monitors/monitors.json), as stall-watch and codex-watch are.
#
#   review-watch.sh --monitor   THE WATCHER. Looks every 60 s, starts what is
#                               due, and prints each verdict once; every block
#                               it prints reaches the lead as a notification.
#                               Ends with its session (the reviews it started
#                               run to their own end).
#   review-watch.sh --tick      one look, printing what the monitor would print
#   review-watch.sh --status    is this session watched, and which reviews run
#
# It reviews only repositories listed in SECOND_REVIEW_REPOS in the governed
# repository's orchestration.config. The logic: scripts/lib/review_watch.py.
