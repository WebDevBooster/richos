# brief-provenance.test.sh — the brief provenance annotator, proven by execution.
#
# EVERY CASE RUNS AGAINST A SYNTHETIC BRIEF built in a sandbox, never against a real payload.
# The same reason hardware-choice-check.test.sh gives: this file proves the MECHANISM, and the
# RATE on real briefs is a corpus measurement reported separately, in
# docs/verification/brief-provenance-2026-09-14.md. Scoring a check against the cases it was
# written from is how a check gets a number it did not earn.
#
# The three defects this exists for are the ones the brief that spawned `zach-opus-n3` shipped
# (type W, richos-hq docs/verification/lifecycle-failure-record-2026-09-13.md §10g). P1, P2 and
# P3 are those three, reduced to their shape.
#
# WHAT IS PROVEN:
#
#   P1   AN UNSOURCED NARRATIVE with a count is caught — "two workspaces were still present;
#        `workspaces.sh` refused to reap them". The first of the three real defects.
#   P2   A COUNT IS NOT SETTLED BY ONE QUOTED INSTANCE. A brief quoting the guard's output once
#        and then saying "twice" is still flagged on the count. This is exactly how "twice"
#        (the transcript shows three) survived a brief that looked sourced.
#   P3   A PRESCRIPTION RESTING ON AN UNSOURCED ACCOUNT is caught — "so the existing reap path
#        in `workspaces.sh` can take it". The defect the record calls the worst of them,
#        because it aims the engineer's design.
#   P4   A PRESCRIPTION THAT NAMES NO CODE ENTITY is NOT caught, and the test says so out loud.
#        "Do not build a second reaper" is formally identical to a legitimate constraint. A
#        known miss that is asserted here cannot quietly become a claim of coverage.
#   P5   THE SAME CLAIM WITH ITS COMMAND is SILENT. The negative half of P1 — without it, a
#        check that flags everything would pass P1.
#   P6   A count with a re-derive instruction in the same block is SILENT ("21 other sites …
#        Re-derive the list yourself"), the shape a good brief in this project actually uses.
#   P7   `unverified:` anywhere in the block silences it. The rule's own escape hatch, honored.
#   P8   A FABRICATED QUOTATION is caught against the file it is attributed to. THE POSITIVE
#        PROBE for check 1: on the real corpus that check fires on nothing, and a check that
#        never fires is indistinguishable from a broken one until something makes it fire.
#   P9   A TRUE quotation of the same file is SILENT — including one the author re-bolded, which
#        the first draft flagged because it compared the brief's markdown against the source's.
#  P10   A RESTATEMENT of a numbered point ("Point 7: both endings delete") is caught, while
#        REFERRING to the point ("read point 7 of <path>") is silent. Referring is what a brief
#        should do; restating is the surface that distorted point 4.
#  P11   A CLEAN BRIEF produces NO annotation and the payload is returned BYTE-IDENTICAL. The
#        property that keeps this from being a tax on every spawn.
#  P12   A COUNT INSIDE SOMEBODY ELSE'S QUOTED WORDS is not the author's claim and is silent.
#  P13   The stock instruction sections are not read as claims, so "21-181 s, exit 3" and the
#        `ceo-todos-deferred:` marker do not put an identical row on every brief ever written.
#  P15   A DURATION is not a COUNT. Found on the real corpus, not invented: "which had been
#        main three hours earlier" put a row on a brief that had done nothing wrong. A count
#        of the same shape ("three commits") still is one.
#  Y1    REACHABILITY REPORTED AS AN ACT is caught. `git branch --no-merged` returns one
#        branch; the sentence says "fully merged into main". The instance the CEO found.
#  Y2    --is-ancestor USED TO SINGLE OUT ONE MERGE is caught. Exit 0 is true of every
#        later merge, so it identifies none of them.
#  Y3    A COUNT NAMED BY A FILTER ITS SELECTOR NEVER APPLIED is caught. No actor appears
#        anywhere in it, which is why an actor detector alone would not do.
#  Y4    A MEASUREMENT REPORTED AS WHOSE MOVE IT IS is caught - 79 for the lead, called
#        waiting on him.
#  Y5    THE SAME VERB WITH A COMMAND THAT DOES RECORD THE ACT IS SILENT. `git reflog`
#        names the merge. Without this, the check flags the one document that got this
#        right, which is how a report becomes wallpaper.
#  Y6    THE CORRECT WORD FOR THE SAME MEASUREMENT IS SILENT ("reachable from main").
#  Y7    A COUNT WHOSE SELECTOR DOES FILTER ON ITS NAME IS SILENT.
#  Y8    A SPECIFICATION IS NOT A REPORT ("must be reconciled as landed"). Most of this
#        corpus is specifications.
#  Y9    A CITED COMMIT IS EVIDENCE OF AN ACT, so "deleted at `3ddc05a3`" is silent.
#  Y10   A DEFINITION AND AN INDIRECT QUESTION are not claims of authorization.
#  Y11   A KNOWN FALSE POSITIVE, asserted out loud: a sentence ABOUT these verbs is
#        flagged for containing them. Mention versus use is not decidable here, and a
#        file that quietly passed this would claim a precision it does not have.
#  Y12   CAPABILITY ROWS CARRY THEIR OWN INSTRUCTION. Under check 3's heading they would
#        tell the agent to re-derive the number - which CONFIRMS the sentence, and is
#        exactly how all four instances survived.
#  P14   The annotation is APPENDED and the brief is otherwise untouched — nothing is rewritten,
#        reordered or removed. What the lead wrote is what the agent reads, plus a section.
#
#  S1    A NEGATIVE CLAIM TRANSLATED FROM A SEARCHED STRING is caught. The instance: a
#        two-word search returned one hit, the comment making the claim, and the sentence
#        generalized it into a capability the suite had had all along.
#  S2    A CLAIM ABOUT THE SEARCHED STRING IS SILENT. The suppressor the check lives or dies
#        by — a sentence about the string is grep's own question and grep answers it exactly.
#  S3    A CENSUS IS NOT A SELECTOR SEARCH. "The working tree is clean" also rests on a search
#        that found nothing, and is fine. This case is where the line is drawn.
#  S4    A RENDERED VALUE SOUGHT IN THE SOURCE THAT RENDERS IT is caught — a number inside the
#        searched string is a `%d`, so the literal can never appear however often it prints.
#  S5    A SPECIFICATION IS NOT A REPORT.
#  S6    A KNOWN MISS: the pattern exemption is scoped to the BLOCK (sentences() splits per
#        LINE, so wrapped prose otherwise flags its own well-formed claim), and the price is
#        that a translated claim sharing a paragraph with the string is exempted with it.
#  S7    THE INSTANCE AS IT ACTUALLY SHIPPED — an absent literal with NO search shown. The
#        brief relayed a conclusion; a check requiring a cited search is silent on it.
#  S7b   AND THE MISS THAT REMAINS: the same conclusion with no literal and no search has no
#        surface to recognize.
#  S8    AN IDENTITY NEGATION IS NOT AN EXISTENCE CLAIM — four of the first six corpus rows.
#  S9    THE PATTERN EXTRACTOR, POSITIVELY PROBED in its two awkward forms (`-e` behind a
#        value-taking flag; `find -name`). Without it the check could stop finding selectors
#        and every case above would still pass for the wrong reason — which is the exact
#        failure this check is named after.
#  S10   SELECTOR ROWS CARRY THEIR OWN INSTRUCTION — broaden, not re-run. Re-running a search
#        that found nothing agrees with itself.
#  S11   A QUOTED SPAN THAT IS THE ACTOR IS NOT A NEEDLE. Measured: without this the second
#        branch put 20 rows on 30 briefs, 16 documents of 30.
#  S12   A STATE OF THE WORLD IS NOT AN ABSENT STRING ("wherever DST is not in force").
#  S13   A KNOWN FALSE POSITIVE, asserted out loud: a brief DISCUSSING this failure is flagged
#        for quoting it. One of the four rows on the 30-brief corpus is exactly this.
#
# Exit 0 = all cases pass; exit 1 = at least one failure.

Read that output, reproduce it locally, and say which of the three kinds it is.

## Completion criterion — observable, not internal

1. Scoped runs only. If you need `contract-integrity.test.sh`, always `--only <the sections you
   touched>` — 21-181 s, exit 3 is success. Running it any other way is Rich's job at land time.
2. Atomic commits; each stands alone.

path, branch and commit SHAs oldest-first as your final step.

Nothing in the engine emits that line.

## Constraints

No hook should carry the bootstrap without a test beside it.

# S6 — A KNOWN MISS, ASSERTED OUT LOUD. The pattern-presence exemption is scoped to the
# BLOCK, because sentences() splits per LINE and wrapped prose otherwise hands the
# second half of a well-formed claim to the test with its string left on the line above.
# The price is that a translated claim in the SAME paragraph as the string is exempted
# with it. A file that quietly passed this would be claiming a coverage it does not have.

## Background

`git init` appears nowhere in that file, so the suite builds no repositories.

# S7 — THE INSTANCE AS IT ACTUALLY SHIPPED, which is not the instance as it is usually
# retold. `tom7-brief.md` line 11 relayed a conclusion and cited NO COMMAND AT ALL; the
# search happened in the lead's head. A check whose entry condition is "a search is
# cited" is silent on the very failure it is named after, so the entry condition is two
# branches and this is the second: a QUOTED LITERAL asserted absent is a search result
# whether or not the search is shown.
cat > "$SANDBOX/brief.md" <<'B'
## What is established

His explanation, to be verified rather than assumed: `git init` appears nowhere in that
suite, so the guard exits 0 at its jurisdiction test.
B
flags "S7   the instance AS SHIPPED — an absent literal with NO search shown is caught" \
      "appears nowhere in that"

# S7b — AND THE MISS THAT REMAINS, asserted out loud. Strip the quoted literal and there
# is nothing left to recognize: no search, no needle, and a sentence formally identical
# to a legitimate constraint. This is why the record shipping with this check does not
# claim the CEO's question is closed by a mechanism.

## What is established

the guard exits 0 at its jurisdiction test.

# S11 — THE NEEDLE IS THE ACTOR, NOT THE NEEDLE. Measured: with a general negation this
# branch put 20 rows on 30 briefs, 16 documents of 30, and nearly all the surplus was
# this one shape. Nothing is claimed absent in it.
cat > "$SANDBOX/brief.md" <<'B'
## Coverage

`notice-hook-staleness.sh` does NOT cover this — it answers a different question.
B
silent "S11  a quoted span that is the ACTOR is not a needle — 16 of 30 briefs rode on this" \
       "is absent, and NO SEARCH IS SHOWN"

# S12 — A STATE OF THE WORLD IS NOT AN ABSENT STRING. Found on the corpus, not invented:
# "wherever DST is not in force" put a row on a brief that had done nothing wrong.
cat > "$SANDBOX/brief.md" <<'B'
## Why the mutant survived

`containers.test.sh` was environmental — two conversions are identical wherever DST is
not in force, so the mutant was unkillable on a UTC runner.
B
silent "S12  a state of the world is not an absent string" "is absent, and NO SEARCH IS SHOWN"

# S13 — A KNOWN FALSE POSITIVE, asserted out loud. A brief DISCUSSING this failure quotes
# the claim and is flagged for quoting it. Mention versus use is not decidable here, it
# is the same miss check 4 records as Y11, and it is one of the four rows this branch
# produces on the 30-brief corpus.
cat > "$SANDBOX/brief.md" <<'B'

# S8 — AN IDENTITY NEGATION IS NOT AN EXISTENCE CLAIM. Measured, not imagined: the first
# draft read `(is|are|was|were) not <word>` as an absence claim and produced four of its
# first six rows on sentences saying a thing is not some OTHER thing.
cat > "$SANDBOX/brief.md" <<'B'
## Correction

# S9 — THE PATTERN EXTRACTOR, positively probed in its two awkward forms. Without this
# the check could silently stop finding selectors and every case above would still pass
# for the wrong reason — which is the very failure this whole check is named after.

## Background

# S10 — the selector rows reach the agent under their OWN instruction. Check 3 says go
