# disk-watchdog.test.sh — AN ALARM IS JUDGED ON WHEN IT STAYS SILENT.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
# ===========================================================================
# A watchdog has four ways to fail and only one of them is visible:
#
#   1. IT DOES NOT FIRE when it should. The disk fills and nobody is told.
#   2. IT FIRES WHEN IT SHOULD NOT. Worse than 1 over any length of time,
#      because an alarm that cries wolf is one somebody switches off, and then
#      failure 1 arrives permanently and silently.
#   3. IT IS NOT THERE AT ALL. A watchdog that was never scheduled looks
#      EXACTLY like a disk that never gets low. This is the failure nothing
#      inside the job can detect, which is why its absence is its own alert.
#   4. IT READS NONE OF ITS DECLARATIONS and looks fine because a fallback
#      happened to match. This is not hypothetical: the first run of this
#      program read no configuration at all — orchestration.config was sourced
#      into SHELL variables and never exported, so the python child saw none of
#      it — and it LOOKED correct because the fallback for the primary volume is
#      the same string the config declares. What exposed it was the second
#      volume silently missing.
#
#   W1   the declarations are actually READ — an unusual threshold comes back
#        out of --json. The case that would have caught failure 4, and it uses
#        a deliberately silly number for exactly that reason.
#   W2   a healthy machine: no alert, exit 0.
#   W3   below the floor: the alert fires and names the free space.
#   W4   a fall FASTER THAN THE DECLARED RATE alerts even when absolute space is
#        fine. This is the arm that would have caught 2026-09-17.
#   W5   the FIRST reading is not a drop. No previous state must not read as a
#        fall from zero, or every fresh machine alerts once for nothing.
#   W6   the CEO is notified, on the machine, via osascript, and it is logged.
#   W7   ...and NOT AGAIN within the declared repeat window.
#   W8   ...and only the most severe level per volume per run: below the urgent
#        floor both levels are true and sending both is two alarms for one event.
#   W9   A TIMER THAT IS NOT INSTALLED IS ITSELF A MASSIVE ALERT (failure 3).
#   W10  a timer installed but not reporting for many intervals is an alert —
#        a loaded-but-disabled launchd job fires on time and executes nothing.
#   W11  an UNMOUNTED extra volume is skipped, never reported as 0 bytes free.
#   W12  the sweeper's standing failures reach Rich's alert, with the manual
#        instruction, because that is the CEO rule's clean-up-failed case.
#   W13  the alert is CLASSIFIED: RichOS's own scratch says DEFECT, anything
#        else says other.
#   W14  --alert DOES NOT WRITE THE STATE FILE. A turn end that moved the
#        previous reading forward would destroy the baseline the drop
#        arithmetic subtracts from, silently turning a 15-minute rate alarm
#        into a per-turn-end one.
#   W15  IT RUNS WITH NO SESSION AT ALL — `env -i`, nothing in the
#        environment — and still takes a reading and writes its log line.
#   W16  --install REFUSES from a worktree or a temp directory, because the
#        plist would bake in a path that stops existing at land time.
#   W4c-W4f  THE DIVISOR (Frank's D7). The drop used to be a subtraction against a
#        baseline of any age, so a ten-hour-old reading printed "DROPPED 30.0 GB"
#        and called a normal working day our defect. It is a RATE now, and across a
#        gap longer than a declared number of intervals NO RATE IS COMPUTED at all —
#        the gap is reported instead (W4c/W4e, control W4d). W4f is the hole the fix
#        itself opened, found by this suite: a sub-second gap made a 100 GB fall
#        read as 496,862 GB/hour, so there is a MINIMUM gap too.
#   W17  ONE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE MUST NOT SILENCE THE FAILURE ALERT. The
#        sweeper's failure record honored CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR and this program's
#        reader did not, so an exported variable — and the engine's own suites
#        export it — sent the two to different directories and turned the MASSIVE
#        ALERT off with no sign that it was off (frank-opus-garbage1, D9).
#   W18  THE GARBAGE ALARM. His verdict on everything above it: "its alarm is a
#        disk-space alarm and a delete-failure alarm; it has no garbage alarm",
#        so ~53 GiB produced neither a cleanup nor a word. Garbage the sweeper
#        will never collect now reaches Rich, on its own declared threshold, with
#        the silence control that matters more than the alarm (W18b) and a
#        separate lower threshold for the undecidable pile (W18c, his D12).
#
# --- added 2026-09-19, after the CEO read the alert this mechanism made -----
# "And what is this all about: MASSIVE ALERT — DISK: 218 path(s) could not be
# deleted (delete BY HAND) | 13.9 GB in 4122 place(s) NOTHING WILL EVER COLLECT
# | 11.4 GB in 2 place(s) UNDECIDABLE — no run will clear it". Under one heading:
# 200 paths a defect in the sweeper could not delete, 18 the kernel owns, 12.8 GB
# of our own campaign roots each already printing its `rm -rf`, 1.15 GB of Visual
# Studio Code's and Codex's temporary files, and one figure six hours stale that
# he had already cleared by hand. FOUR DIFFERENT RESPONSES, presented as one
# alarm — and failure 2 in the list above is the one that gets an alarm ignored.
#
#   W19  THREE PILES, THREE HEADINGS. Our failed clean-up is the MASSIVE ALERT
#        and the banner names it (W19/W19a — it said "DISK SPACE" with 198 GB
#        free); the by-hand pile gets its own heading and the command that
#        clears it (W19b); and W19c is the control that decides whether the
#        split is real — the same 13.9 GB, alone, reports and exits 0.
#   W20  EVERY FIGURE CARRIES THE TIME IT WAS MEASURED, and past a declared
#        window it is disowned rather than quoted (W20b). W18/W18a are the
#        amended cases: other programs' temp is reported and is NOT an alarm.
#   W21  --status RUNS the sweeper, so a person who asks gets this second's
#        answer (W21), it is not an ALERT (W21a), and when the sweeper cannot be
#        run the fallback says how old its number is (W21b).
#
# --- added 2026-09-25, after "python3.14 would like to access data from other
# apps" kept appearing on the CEO's screen -------------------------------------
#   W22  THE WATCHDOG NEVER WALKS ANOTHER APP'S DATA. Its `du` walked the folder
#        where macOS keeps other apps' sandboxed data, and macOS asked the CEO for
#        permission on every alerting run; allowing it did not stick. W22 plants
#        that folder, its holders ($HOME, ~/Library) and an app-group folder in
#        the candidate list of a forced alert, with a `du` stub that records every
#        path it is handed: none of them may reach `du`, each must be reported as
#        refused, and an ordinary folder beside them MUST still be measured
#        (the positive probe). W22d is the declaration itself: no entry of the
#        REAL orchestration.config may enter that data.
#
# Exit 0 = every case passed; exit 1 = at least one failed.

# The line the CEO read on 2026-09-19 ran all three together:
#
#   MASSIVE ALERT — DISK: 218 path(s) could not be deleted (delete BY HAND)
#   | 13.9 GB in 4122 place(s) NOTHING WILL EVER COLLECT
#   | 11.4 GB in 2 place(s) UNDECIDABLE — no run will clear it
#
# Under one heading: 200 paths a defect could not delete, 18 the kernel owns,
# 12.8 GB of our own campaign roots with a printed command, 1.15 GB of another
# program's temp, and one figure six hours stale. Four different responses. An
# alarm whose items do not share a response is one nobody can act on — and this
# suite's own header ranks firing wrongly as worse than not firing.
