# engine_pass.mutation.sh — PROVES THE ONE-PASS SLOT'S SUITE CAN FAIL.
#
# Takes the SHIPPED scripts/lib/engine_pass.py, removes ONE property at a time in a
# throwaway copy of the engine, and asserts that scripts/lib/engine_pass.test.sh fails on
# the SPECIFIC named case. The loop is scripts/lib/mutation-harness.sh; this file is the list
# of properties "one full engine pass on this Mac at a time" rests on.
#
# Invoked by scripts/lib/engine_pass.test.sh, so the runner that discovers *.test.sh runs it
# too. Run directly: scripts/engine_pass.mutation.sh
# Exit 0 = every property is proven load-bearing.

# THE MERGE GATE LEAVES THIS PASS TO THE NIGHTLY (richos/app/scripts/autocheck/README.md): the
# gate runs the suite with RICHOS_MUTATION_PASSES=0; nightly-engine.py runs every pass.
