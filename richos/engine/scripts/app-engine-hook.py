    **THE DEFECT THIS ANSWERS, measured on 2026-09-18 and quoted from the worker's own last
    words** (`engine-state/evidence/<session>/callbacks.jsonl`, row 21 of a
    `work_lease_roundtrip` run): *"Unable to complete or report via tools - the host's
    PreToolUse hook is blocking all tool actions this turn, including SubagentHandback
    itself, with: 'RichOS desktop engine: This app turn is stopped or is supplying context.
    New actions are unavailable.'"*

    `actions_allowed` is the TURN's grant, opened and closed by `NativeCognition::prompt`.
    A background worker outlives the turn that dispatched it BY DESIGN — `mega-lander/app.py`
    stamps `run_in_background: true` on every payload, the provider answers
    `{"status":"async_launched"}`, and the turn ends with the worker just getting started.
    So the worker did all of its work in the window where the flag was false and had every
    single call refused, produced nothing, and was then disposed of as landed (an agent that
    produced nothing IS landed, worktree-spec point 7) with its worktree deleted.

    **What authorizes the worker instead is its RECEIPT, and those checks are all still
    ahead of it in `handle`:** `guard-sealed-worktree.sh` refuses a run the platform has
    already ended, `validate_shell_target` refuses a Git command whose target it cannot
    read, and `app.py`'s `worker_context` refuses any `agent_id` that does not join exactly
    one live receipt of this session and this binding, refuses the CEO-scoped `mcp__richos_*`
    tools outright, and fences every write inside the registered target worktree. Nothing is
    waved through here; a different, narrower gate answers for a worker than for the lease.

    **A stop still stops it.** The flag is written true in one place (`bind_work_assignment`'s
    standing §5.4 grant) and cleared by `ecs::revoke` — the CEO's stop, the end of the
    assignment, a crash-recovery sweep — and a stop also kills the process group the worker
    lives in. Absent means false, so an older app, a conversation lease, or a scope written
    by anything else refuses a worker exactly as before.
