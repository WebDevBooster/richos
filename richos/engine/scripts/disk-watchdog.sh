# disk-watchdog.sh — THE DISK IS WATCHED WHETHER OR NOT ANYBODY IS LOOKING.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE PROGRAM FROM THE SWEEPER
# ===========================================================================
# CEO, 2026-09-18 (ceo-decisions §54 addendum 1), verbatim: "Yeah, a separate
# disk watchdog is needed because the CEO needs to be alerted in case the disk
# storage gets close to running out FOR ANY REASON."
#
# "For any reason" is the whole specification. A watchdog built into the cleanup
# mechanism can only report the free space that mechanism knows about, and the
# disk can fill from a video export, a Time Machine local snapshot, an Xcode
# simulator runtime, or a download — none of which any sweeper will ever see.
# So this program reads `df` and nothing else. It does not call the sweeper, read
# the sweeper's state, or care whether the sweeper has ever run.
#
# ===========================================================================
# ...AND ADDENDUM 2 SAYS IT SHOULD NEVER FIRE
# ===========================================================================
# "But ideally, the disk watchdog will NEVER bark because the RichOS app failed
# to clean up its garbage. The RichOS app must always clean up its garbage
# automatically, no matter what."
#
# So every alert is CLASSIFIED. If the space is going to RichOS's own scratch —
# the allocator root, the declared legacy families, the session scratchpads —
# the alert says "RichOS garbage (DEFECT)", because that is a bug report about
# us and not a disk warning. Anything else says "other". The two want completely
# different responses and an alert that conflated them would get the wrong one.
#
# ===========================================================================
# TWO AUDIENCES, DIFFERENT THRESHOLDS, DIFFERENT CHANNELS
# ===========================================================================
#   RICH   — a MASSIVE ALERT in the session, at every session start and every
#            turn end, below DISK_RICH_ALERT_GB or on a drop of
#            DISK_DROP_ALERT_GB, repeated every turn until it clears. Earliest,
#            because Rich can act without interrupting anybody.
#   THE CEO — a macOS user notification ON THE MACHINE, at DISK_CEO_NOTIFY_GB
#            and again at DISK_CEO_URGENT_GB, at most once a day per level.
#            `osascript -e 'display notification'` needs no app running and no
#            session open, which is exactly why it is the channel: this fires
#            from launchd at 3 AM with nobody logged into anything.
#
# THE DROP THRESHOLD IS THE ONE THAT WOULD HAVE CAUGHT 2026-09-17. 105 GB
# arrived over a few hours while the volume still had 49 GB free — under an
# absolute floor alone the first warning would have come very late. At a
# 15-minute interval, 20 GB between readings is 80 GB/hour, which nothing
# legitimate on this machine does and the mutation harness demonstrably did.
#
# ===========================================================================
# USAGE
# ===========================================================================
#   disk-watchdog.sh                 retry device cleanup (8s budget), read disk, alert if due
#   disk-watchdog.sh --json          the current state, as JSON
#   disk-watchdog.sh --alert         ONLY the alert block, empty if all clear.
#                                    This is what the session hooks call.
#   disk-watchdog.sh --status        one human line per volume
#   disk-watchdog.sh --install       schedule it (launchd, every 15 min)
#   disk-watchdog.sh --print-plist   render the same service definition without scheduling it
#   disk-watchdog.sh --uninstall     unschedule it
#   disk-watchdog.sh --installed     exit 0 if scheduled, 1 if not
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0  every watched volume is above every threshold
#   1  an alert condition holds (Rich's threshold, or a drop)
#   2  a declaration is missing, or df could not be read
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE STATE FILE IS THE INTERFACE
# ===========================================================================
# $DISK_STATE_JSON (declared; ~/.claude/state/disk-watchdog.json) carries the
# current reading, the previous one, the alert state and the classification. The
# RichOS app reads it for its timeline line; the session hooks read it so a turn
# end costs one file read rather than a df; and it is what makes "repeated once a
# day" possible at all, since a launchd job has no memory of its last run.

# EVERY DECLARATION IS EXPORTED, and this is a bug fixed rather than a style.
#
# Sourcing orchestration.config makes these SHELL variables, which a python
# child cannot see. The first run of this program therefore read NONE of its
# declarations — and it looked like it worked, because the fallback for
# DISK_PRIMARY_VOLUME in disk-watchdog.py is the same string the config
# declares, so the primary volume was reported correctly. What gave it away was
# /Volumes/E1TB silently missing from the output: DISK_EXTRA_VOLUMES fell back
# to empty, and an empty list of extra volumes is indistinguishable from a
# volume that is not mounted.
#
# A DEFAULT THAT HAPPENS TO MATCH THE DECLARATION HIDES BROKEN WIRING. That is
# the general lesson and it is why disk-watchdog.test.sh case W1 declares a
# deliberately UNUSUAL threshold and asserts it comes back out of --json: a test
# using the real numbers would pass against a program reading none of them.
#
# EXPORTED BY PATTERN AND NOT BY NAME, for the reason scratch-reaper.sh gives at
# the same point: a list of names has failed twice by omission, and the failure
# is invisible because the config says the key is set and the code says it reads
# it. `compgen -v` enumerates what sourcing actually did, so a key cannot be
# declared and missed.
#
# The SCRATCH_* keys are read to classify the shortfall as ours or not, to report
# the sweeper's standing failures, and (from 2026-09-18) to report the GARBAGE
# NOTHING WILL EVER COLLECT. OBSERVED, never invoked: this job must not depend on
# the sweeper, only look at what it left behind.
