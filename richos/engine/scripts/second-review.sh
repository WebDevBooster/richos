# second-review.sh: a different model reviews a teammate's exact commits
# against the words it was given, with nobody fetching anything by hand.
#
# On 2026-10-08 the CEO fetched a Codex review of an agent's work by hand four
# times, and each one found defects the author's own tests had passed. His
# words (ruling §113): "A regular RichOS user can never be expected anything
# even remotely close to that. So, this all must be completely automated."
# This is the command that does one such review (slice 1 of richos-hq
# docs/plans/2026-10-09-automatic-second-review-and-t3-ideas.md, with Sage's
# check beside it); the watcher that starts it by itself is slice 2.
#
#   second-review.sh --name <teammate> [--repo <path>] [--trigger handover|long-job|quiet|manual]
#   second-review.sh --repo <path> (--tip <sha> | --branch <b>) --base <sha> --words-file <file> [...]
#
# Exit: 0 passed, 1 changes-requested, 2 no verdict (the row says why),
# 64 refused before any reviewer ran (bad arguments, no original words).
# The logic: scripts/lib/second_review.py.
#
# THE SCRATCH IS ALLOCATED HERE, NOT IN PYTHON, ON PURPOSE: scratch.sh records
# the allocating shell's pid as the owner, and this shell lives exactly as long
# as the review does. So a review killed hard leaves a folder whose owner is
# dead, which the scratch reaper deletes; the release below is the fast path.
