# quota-watch.test.sh — THE 93% RULE'S WATCHER, PROVEN AT ITS EDGES AND END TO END.
#
# His words (ruling §87): "quota polling: every 5 minutes from now. And once it
# crosses the 93% threshold: PAUSE subagents. Then resume after quota rest."
#
#   Q01-Q03  the threshold edges: 92 is below (exit 0), 93 and 94 are at or
#            above (exit 1)
#   Q04-Q07  a missing payload, invalid JSON, no rate_limits.five_hour, and a
#            non-number used_percentage are UNKNOWN (exit 2), never "fine"
#   Q08      a STALE reading below the threshold is UNKNOWN (it proves nothing)
#   Q09      a STALE reading at or above the threshold is still at or above
#            (usage only grows inside one window)
#   Q10      a reading whose window has ended is UNKNOWN
#   Q11-Q13  the threshold is READ FROM orchestration.config: undeclared and
#            malformed are UNKNOWN, and a declared 50 moves the edge to 50
#   Q14      the reading's age and the reset time are printed
#   Q15      --status prints his words, the declared line and the live workers
#   W01      --watch wakes with QUOTA-THRESHOLD when the reading crosses, and
#            prints the pause message with its `pause-until:` line, the
#            minutes to reset and the live-worker count
#   W02      --watch wakes with WINDOW-RESET when the reset passes, with the
#            resume message and NO `pause-until:` line in it
#   W03      at or above the threshold with NOTHING working, --watch does not
#            fire: there is nothing to pause; and when the reset comes within
#            20 minutes with nobody held, there is no QUOTA-RELEASE either
#   W04      --watch --until-reset never fires the threshold, only the reset
#   W05      a reading older than one poll, with a worker running, wakes the
#            lead with QUOTA-STALE: not the current value, refresh it
#   Q16      by default "stale" is ONE poll: 400 s old is unknown, 200 s is not
#
# HIS UPDATE, 2026-09-25 (ruling §87): at or above the threshold, no pause when
# the reset is LESS than 20 minutes away; exactly 20 still pauses; a hold in
# place releases inside that window. And "Keep it consistent at 5 minutes":
#   Q17-Q19  19 minutes to the reset at 95%: no pause (exit 3); exactly 20
#            minutes: pause (exit 1); 21 minutes: pause (exit 1). The clock is
#            pinned, so each boundary is exact to the second
#   Q20      1199 s is inside the exception, 1 s is inside it, and 0 s is a
#            window that has ended (UNKNOWN), never "inside the exception"
#   Q21      a STALE reading at or above the threshold gets the exception too
#            (resets_at does not move inside a window): 19 min exit 3, 21 exit 1
#   Q22      below the threshold, and UNKNOWN, are untouched by the exception
#   Q23      one 5-minute poll at every usage level: 69% and 71% readings
#            400 s old are both UNKNOWN by default (no 30-minute tier)
#   Q24      --status names the update and prints "NO PAUSE" inside the window
#   W10      19 minutes to the reset with a worker running: no QUOTA-THRESHOLD
#   W11      21 minutes to the reset with a worker running: QUOTA-THRESHOLD
#   R01      2026-09-25's log replayed, with its real reset (03:40Z): the
#            payload sat at 56/71/89% and jumped to 100% while the lead was
#            idle; the watcher wakes the lead (QUOTA-REFRESH or QUOTA-STALE)
#            while it sits at 56%, and
#            QUOTA-THRESHOLD fires before 100%, about 90 minutes before the
#            reset, so the near-reset exception does not apply
#   R02      the same log with its reset moved to 02:20Z: the crossing falls
#            inside the last 20 minutes, and nobody is paused
#
# THE READING FROM CLAUDE CODE'S OWN get_usage (2026-09-25). The suite never
# starts the operator's `claude`: QUOTA_CLAUDE_BIN points at nothing, so every
# case above reads the status-line fallback, and the G cases point it at a
# fixture that speaks the control protocol:
#   G01      --once reads get_usage (95%), not the status-line file (50%), and
#            the fixture refuses any argument list but the control-only one
#   G02      the process it started is ENDED after the read, though the
#            fixture would linger 30 s; it asked initialize, then get_usage
#   G03-G06  refused, no subscription limits, never answering (bounded by the
#            deadline, and the hung process ended), unreadable, closed early:
#            each falls back to the status-line file and says why
#   G07      --watch takes a fresh get_usage at every poll, so a status-line
#            file ten minutes old wakes nobody
#   G09      get_usage refused with "Login expired": the login alarm is raised
#            (sandboxed: a recorder, never the CEO's notification center)
#   G10      any other refusal raises no login alarm
#   G08      get_usage failing: a stale status-line file still wakes the lead
#   R04      this morning's 91% (07:57Z) to 95% (08:07Z), lead idle: through
#            get_usage the pause fires before 08:07Z under 95%, no wake needed
#
# THE FALLBACK IS REFRESHED BEFORE IT TURNS ONE POLL OLD (the same morning:
# the pause fired at 95, not 93, because a 300 s poll first saw the file
# stale at its second poll, about 600 s after the render):
#   W12      below the threshold with a worker running, QUOTA-REFRESH comes
#            at the refresh point, while the reading is under one poll old
#   W13      at the refresh point with nothing working, nobody is woken
#   R03      the 07:57Z/08:07Z shape on the fallback: every wake is a REFRESH
#            under one poll old, and the pause fires before 08:07Z under 95%
#   W06      a stale reading with nothing running does NOT wake the lead
#   W07      no payload at all: the watcher keeps polling, and with nothing
#            working it wakes nobody (until 2026-09-28 it exited 2 at start)
#   W08      no threshold declared: --watch cannot watch, exit 2
#   W09      the default poll is his "every 5 minutes" (300 s), and a worker
#            set the registry cannot name still fires the threshold
#   E01-E06  END TO END through the real workspace registry and the real
#            resume guard — the 2026-09-18 failure, reproduced and fixed:
#              E01  at the threshold both running workers are named
#              E02  the printed pause message keeps its agent PAUSED through
#                   its own SubagentStop (mega-lander point 11)
#              E03  so the lead's wake message to it is ALLOWED
#              E04  the 2026-09-18 hold message (no pause-until: line) still
#                   leaves a FINISHED agent, and its wake is still REFUSED
#              E05  when the reset comes within 20 minutes, QUOTA-RELEASE names
#                   only the quota-paused agent, on time at the default
#                   300 s poll, and not a second before the boundary
#              E06  the printed release message resumes the SAME agent
#              E07  --until-reset also wakes at the release when one is held
#              E08  at the reset only the quota-paused agent is named to wake
#              E09  the printed resume message resumes it in the registry
#
# THE POLLING NEVER STOPS (2026-09-28). --watch used to EXIT to wake the lead,
# and at the 14:30Z reset and a 15:32Z get_usage timeout nothing polled until
# the lead started it again by hand. Now a poller polls for as long as its
# session lives; --watch (the fallback doorbell) still exits on a wake-up, and
# --monitor (the plugin monitor every interactive session starts) prints it
# and goes on. Every case below fails on the watcher before that change:
#   N01      at the reset the lead is woken ONCE and the polling goes on into
#            the new window
#   N02      get_usage timing out twice at 8% (the 15:32Z shape, initialize
#            answered): retried sooner than a poll, nobody woken, polling goes
#            on, and the failure says which request hung and claude's stderr
#   N03      a crossing during a timeout streak, seen by the status line:
#            QUOTA-THRESHOLD, and the polling goes on
#   N04      a timeout streak right after a steep measured rise: QUOTA-STALE as
#            soon as the reading is a poll old, not at the two-poll cap
#   N05      an outage that does not end, far from the threshold: ONE
#            QUOTA-STALE at the two-poll mark, and the polling goes on
#   N06      a stale status-line reading: QUOTA-STALE once, polling goes on
#   M01      --monitor prints each wake-up once and no poll line, keeps
#            running, --watch stands down to it, --alive names it, and it ends
#            with its session, poller and all
#   M02      --alive with nothing polling: NOT WATCHED, exit 2
#
# HIGH SPEED, ruling §108 (2026-10-04): when usage speeds up a lot, check every
# 2 minutes and wake the lead early enough that the hold lands before 100%;
# and (its addendum) alert the lead so the CEO is told:
#   R05      2026-09-29's 15 Fable workers replayed, at the real poll phase and
#            every 30 s phase: the window is under 100% when the hold lands
#   R06      the same run: 300 s polls until the speed is measured, then 120 s
#   R08      the same run: QUOTA-FAST once, at the first fast measurement,
#            before the pause
#   R09      the same run at its measured 3.99 points a minute held to 100%
#            (it really slowed after 91%): the EARLY pause, below 93% where it
#            must be, lands the hold under 100% at every 30 s poll phase
#   R07      the fastest normal rise ever logged: exactly as before, 300 s
#            polls, no alert, the pause at the first reading >= 93%
#
# The mutation harness, quota-watch.mutation.sh, is run from the bottom of
# this file, so the runner that discovers *.test.sh runs it too.
#
# Exit 0 = every case passed; exit 1 = at least one failed.

PAUSE — CEO's standing quota rule: the five-hour window is at 92% used with 36 minutes to its reset and three workers are running. Finish the edit you are in the middle of, commit everything you have on your branch (atomic, with truthful messages; a WIP commit is fine and gets amended later), write one line in your worktree at .claude/PAUSED.md saying where you stopped and what comes next, and then STOP — make no further tool calls until you receive my message "RESUME".
