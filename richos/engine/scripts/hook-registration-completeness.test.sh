# hook-registration-completeness.test.sh — the suite for the predicate

# scripts/hooks/guard-hook-registration-commits.sh.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THIS HAS TO PROVE, AND WHY EACH CASE EXISTS
# ===========================================================================
# The thing under test refuses commits, so the expensive failure is not a miss
# — it is a FALSE REFUSAL that makes somebody route around the guard. So the
# cases split three ways and the middle group is the largest:
#
#   IT FIRES      on an incomplete registration, naming every missing place.
#   IT IS SILENT  on a complete one, on an unrelated commit, on a repository
#                 with no engine, and — the one that decides whether this guard
#                 is worse than nothing — on a hook that DOES resolve a root,
#                 which must never be asked for R_ROOTLESS_HOOKS.
#   IT IS LOAD-BEARING: the negative cases are re-run against a MUTATED copy of
#                 the predicate, so a case that would pass for the wrong reason
#                 is caught. A negative test with no positive probe passes when
#                 the mechanism is deleted.
#
# EVERY CASE RUNS AGAINST A SANDBOX CLONE, never the live tree: the predicate
# reads a git baseline and a worktree, and a suite that mutated the real one
# would be a suite that can lose somebody's work.
