# run-all-tests.test.sh — THE RUNNER'S LEAK CANARY, PROVEN WHERE IT LIVES.
#
# scripts/lib/leak-canary.test.sh proves the DETECTOR. This proves the WIRING,
# and they are different claims: a correct detector that is never consulted, or
# consulted and then not allowed to change the verdict, is a green tick over
# the defect with extra steps. That distinction is not academic here — on
# 2026-09-02 five separate checks in this engine were found green over code
# that never ran.
#
# So every case below drives the REAL scripts/run-all-tests.sh against a
# throwaway engine containing throwaway suites, and reads its EXIT CODE and its
# OUTPUT — never the library's return value.
#
# BOTH DIRECTIONS, because a canary that reports everything is as useless as
# one that reports nothing: a suite that writes only in its own sandbox must
# leave the runner GREEN (case 1), and one that writes into the checkout must
# turn it RED and be NAMED (cases 2 and 3).
#
# NOT COVERED, by name: the cost of the canary on a real 68-suite run, and
# whether any SHIPPED suite trips it. That is a measurement over a run of about
# an hour, not a unit test, and it belongs in a measurement record rather than
# here.
