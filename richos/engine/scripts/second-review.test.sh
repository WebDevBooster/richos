# second-review.test.sh: THE SECOND REVIEW, STARTED BY A COMMAND, NEVER BY HAND
# (scripts/second-review.sh running scripts/lib/second_review.py), against a
# fake reviewer program and fixture state only. Never the operator's registry,
# ~/.claude/state, ~/.codex or a real model.
#
# 2026-10-08: the CEO fetched a Codex review of an agent's work by hand four
# times, and each found defects the author's tests had passed. His words
# (ruling §113): "A regular RichOS user can never be expected anything even
# remotely close to that. So, this all must be completely automated." Every
# case below fails on a checkout without scripts/second-review.sh.
#
#   C01  a handover review by teammate name: the input holds the brief exactly
#        as the teammate received it, the exact 40-character tip, the author's
#        commit message and last report; Codex runs with the pinned model and
#        effort, a workspace-write sandbox rooted at the export, outside a git
#        repository and --ephemeral (no entry in the user's Codex app); the
#        export is not the author's workspace; one ledger row with both models
#        (Codex's from its own logged session start), the CLI version, the token
#        count and the meter; the fixture is kept; the scratch is gone
#   C02  one blocking finding forces changes-requested whatever the reviewer
#        wrote, and nothing is filed as a follow-up (ruling §116)
#   C03  a recheck of the same work carries the earlier finding into the input
#   C04  a verdict naming another commit is refused: no verdict
#   C05  an answer outside the fixed shape is no verdict
#   C06  Codex at its usage limit: the Claude fallback reviews, on Opus
#   C07  Codex missing and the quota hold in force: no Claude review starts
#   C08  work Codex wrote (a codex/ branch) is reviewed by Claude
#   C09  CPU admission closed: no reviewer starts
#   C10  a reviewer past its time limit is stopped by its own process id
#   C11  no original words: refused before any reviewer runs
#   C12  the reviewer's builds are capped at 2 jobs (environment and input): on
#        2026-10-09 the CPU breaker stopped a reviewer's rustc at 5.08 cores
#   C13  second-review stopped from outside (review-watch replacing a mid-job
#        review) stops its reviewer too, and its scratch is released
#   C14  ruling §116: only non-blocking findings (one of them a P1) pass,
#        whatever the reviewer wrote, mid-job too, and each is filed in
#        <state>/review-follow-ups.jsonl; the result line says how many, where
#   C15  a recheck marks filed findings as already on the list; a pass with
#        them still open does not file them twice
#   C16  an earlier finding still open that blocks requests changes
#   C17  one work in two repositories: each repository's review carries and
#        files only its own repository's findings
#   C18  the reviewer never runs the user's own setup: Codex --ephemeral (no
#        session or history entry his Codex or ChatGPT app shows), without his
#        config.toml (its notify program made macOS ask the CEO, 2026-10-09) or
#        his exec-policy rules, notify empty, plugins, apps, hooks, computer use
#        and browser use off; Claude with no MCP server (--strict-mcp-config)
#   C19  an app review runs Claude on the account the app's work runs on when the
#        reviewer starts: started by the app's watcher (review_watch.py's spawn of
#        an app item) through this command, the reviewer gets the added account's
#        folder as CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR and its id; after a switch back, Account 1's
#        inherited folder; the ledger stays where it was
#
# Exit 0 = every case passed; exit 1 = at least one failed.
