# review-watch.test.sh: THE SECOND REVIEW STARTS BY ITSELF (scripts/review-watch.sh
# running scripts/lib/review_watch.py), against fixture state and a fake
# second-review only. Never the operator's registry, ~/.claude/state, a real
# model or a real teammate.
#
# 2026-10-08: the CEO fetched a Codex review of an agent's work by hand four
# times. His words (ruling §113): "A regular RichOS user can never be expected
# anything even remotely close to that. So, this all must be completely
# automated." Every case below fails on a checkout without scripts/review-watch.sh.
#
#   W01  THE REPLAY of the 2026-10-08 dictation record (timestamps only:
#        registry rows and commit times, scripts/fixtures/review-watch-
#        dictation-2026-10-08.json), one look per minute from 02:52Z to 19:05Z:
#        a handover review starts within two looks of every handover of
#        dictation slices 1-4 (dict1, dict1b, dict1c, dict2, dict3, dict3b,
#        dict4, dict4c) and of slice 5 (dict5, dict5b, dict5c); at least one
#        mid-job review of echo-fable-dict5 starts before 15:03Z and none in a
#        teammate's first 60 minutes; the stopped and discarded dict4b gets
#        none; one tip is never reviewed twice at once; each handover tip is
#        reviewed once
#   W02  a lost review (it ends with no verdict) is started once more, and a
#        second loss is told once; nothing more starts for that commit
#   W03  a handover, end to end through the script: one review starts at the
#        first look, by registry key, on the agent's own commits only (the
#        merge base with main, which has moved on since), with the handover
#        trigger and the work's key; a second look starts nothing more (the
#        lock); the verdict is told once, with what the lead can do; told
#        again 30 minutes later while nobody continues the work, and not once
#        a continuation names it
#   W04  the long-job clock starts at the registry's start, never at git's
#        dates: a base committed a day before the start gets no review at a
#        commit five minutes in, and one 61 minutes in
#   W05  a running teammate gone quiet (no commit, no transcript write for 20
#        minutes) with unreviewed commits gets a review
#   W06  a handover replaces a mid-job review of the same tip: the mid-job
#        review is stopped by its recorded pid and the handover one starts
#   W07  Codex's READY entry starts a review of its codex/ branch, with the
#        to-codex.md entry that named the branch as the original words
#   W08  a finding still open through two rechecks in a row is told once as
#        not converging; never one filed as a follow-up (blocks false); one
#        work in two repositories is compared repository by repository
#   W09  a repository not in SECOND_REVIEW_REPOS is never reviewed; with the
#        key absent it says so once and starts nothing; a value bash sets that
#        is not names (review_repos in scripts/lib/operator_fences.py, the one
#        reader install and the land use too, sources the config in bash) is
#        said once and starts nothing
#   W10  monitors.json starts review-watch.sh --monitor always
#   W11  --host-json (the operator install's host child, slice 4): a look's notices
#        are one JSON line per lead session, for the host to send to that lead
#   W12  a verdict reaches its lead session even when the worker committed while
#        its review ran: by the review's own record (lock, then attempt row), and
#        by the work's stable identity when no record names it
#   W13  the host's quit (SIGTERM, five-second bound): the watcher stops every
#        review it started at once, escalating to SIGKILL itself, and exits on
#        its own inside the bound with none left running
#   W14  the app's watcher picks only receipts with request.role worker for a
#        mid-job review, never a quiet handover reviewer's cc/ workspace
#   W15  the host's quit records a review stopped only once its whole process
#        group, its reviewer included, is gone (a responsive and a deaf launcher)
#   W16  a SIGTERM during spawn, before the review's pid reaches its lock, still
#        stops that review and settles it as stopped
#   W17  a verdict goes to the review's recorded owner first; a registry fallback
#        needs the same work, never another work holding the reviewed commit
#   W18  a reviewer forked at any point of a stop ends with its review: one asked
#        for the moment before the SIGKILL by a second-review that cannot act on
#        the stop is never forked (the review is frozen), one forked before the
#        stop's first signal is ended (the reviewer's fixture
#        fork_after_final_scan.py)
#   W19  the repeated handover notice goes to the recorded owner of the same
#        work, on that work's own clock, never to another work at the tip
#   W20  the plain monitor prints a verdict only in its owner's session, unless
#        the owner has no live monitor to print it
#   W21  only a verdict's owner consumes it: a monitor's first look tells its own
#        session's verdicts another lead's monitor saw or left (the reviewer's
#        fixture monitor_first_look_owner_loss.py)
#   W22  the operator host recovers a verdict another monitor passed, and
#        verdicts past a block's cap are told at the next look, never dropped
#   W23  the host's quit ends the reviewer's own tool commands too, each in a
#        process group of its own, as Codex runs them
#   W24  nothing undelivered is marked told at the upgrade or expires, and a
#        told verdict stays told while it is in the ledger
#   W25  the quit ends a tool's background task its launching shell left behind,
#        reparented to PID 1: it carries the review's mark (the reviewer's
#        fixture background_tool_quit.py)
#   W26  past run_bounded's time limit the launcher exits, and its lock is settled
#        only once the reviewer's tool, which carries its mark, is gone (the
#        reviewer's fixture timeout_then_quit.py)
#   W27  a verdict is delivered only once the host accepts it: a failed pipe, or no
#        acknowledgment from a host that acknowledges, leaves it for the next look
#        (the reviewer's fixture delivery_ack_gap.py)
#   W28  a mid-job verdict is recorded delivered only once the app's worker hook has
#        written and flushed its answer: a closed pipe leaves it for the next tool call
#        (the reviewer's fixture mid_job_failed_output.py)
#   W29  the quit keeps ending the review's own session after its launcher exits:
#        a platform tool that hides the mark is ended, and the lock is settled only
#        then (the reviewer's fixture orphan_platform_same_session.py)
#   W30  a process table that cannot be read is never an empty session: the quit
#        keeps the review's lock until a read sees its tool gone (the reviewer's
#        fixture process_table_failure.py)
#   W31  the host's watcher knows its host before the first look: a host that died
#        while it started means no look and an exit (the reviewer's fixture
#        parent_exit_before_init.py)
#   W32  the NO VERDICT TWICE notice is delivered only once the host accepts it,
#        like a verdict: a failed pipe, or no acknowledgment, leaves it for the
#        next look (the reviewer's fixture unacknowledged_host_notice.py)
#   W33  a notice the monitor's output cap leaves out is neither delivered nor told:
#        a later look tells it (the reviewer's fixture capped_lost_notice.py)
#   W34  the NOT CONVERGING notice is kept until its output is accepted, like its
#        verdict: a failed pipe, or no acknowledgment, tells both again
#
# Every case loads scripts/lib/app_review.py too: review_watch.py imports its app_paths.
# The app mode (--app-state) and app_review.py's mid-job notice are driven over the real
# app fixture in mega-lander/tests/app.test.py.
#
# Exit 0 = every case passed; exit 1 = at least one failed.
