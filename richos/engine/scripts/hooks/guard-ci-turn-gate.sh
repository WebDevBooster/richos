# guard-ci-turn-gate.sh — BLOCKING Stop hook. THE TURN DOES NOT END WHILE THIS
#                          SESSION'S OWN PUSH IS FAILING CI.
#
# THE FOUNDER'S QUESTION, 2026-09-13, asked twice in one evening after three
# screenshots of red CI:
#
#     "How many more times will I need to post screenshots of that CI?"
#
# He was given a promise. He then asked the question a promise cannot answer —
# HOW WOULD HE KNOW the answer was zero — and the honest answer was that he
# could not. This is the mechanism that makes it knowable: he can watch it
# refuse, the way he can watch GitHub's `main-only` ruleset refuse a branch.
#
# THIS WRAPPER DECIDES NOTHING. It settles jurisdiction (which repository is
# this session's?), then hands the entire verdict to guard-ci-turn-gate.py —
# the predicate, the budget, the escape hatch and the words. That file's header
# carries the argument for every one of them, in particular the crux: a run
# still IN PROGRESS does not hold the turn, it holds the obligation, and every
# later turn-end re-reads it.
#
# THE BUDGET IS A NUMBER, NOT AN ADJECTIVE: BUDGET_SECONDS = 2.0 in the
# analyzer, enforced as a wall-clock deadline around every subprocess it
# starts. A check that cannot answer inside its budget ALLOWS the turn and says
# why. The `timeout` on the registration is the host's backstop, not the budget.
#
# FAILS OPEN ON ITS OWN ERROR, LOUDLY, for guard-workspace-gate.sh's reason: a
# broken engine that could never let a turn end would trap the founder's
# session, so every failure here is announced and none of them blocks.

# --- ROOT RESOLUTION -------------------------------------------------------
# TWO ROOTS, NEVER ONE. The full contract, and why the old single-root
# resolution was wrong the moment the engine became loadable by reference,
# is in scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. This bootstrap block is byte-identical
# in every hook that needs a root; contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R asserts
# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
#
# THE BANNER BELOW GOES OUT ON TWO CHANNELS AND ONLY THE SECOND IS HEARD.
# Measured on Claude Code 2.1.270 (macOS, 2026-09-14) by registering one probe
# hook per channel on five events at once and reading the transcript back:
#
#   channel, exit 0     SessionStart  UserPromptSubmit  PreToolUse  PostToolUse  Stop
#   stderr              silent        silent            silent      silent       silent
#   stdout, plain text  model         model             silent      silent       silent
#   {"systemMessage"}   PERSON        PERSON            PERSON      PERSON       PERSON
#   additionalContext   model         model             model       model        model
#
# `silent` is not shorthand: the host records a `hook_success` attachment
# carrying the text in its stderr field and renders it to NO ONE. So a hook
# that could not find its own engine announced a dead enforcement layer
# exactly as loudly as a clean pass. Of the 60 files carrying this block, 35
# exit 2 here — where the host does render stderr, as the refusal reason — and
# 24 exit 0 and were inaudible. The 24 are the notices and observers, which is
# the trap: the hooks that must never block are the hooks nobody could hear.
#
# WHY `systemMessage` AND NOT `additionalContext`. additionalContext must name
# its own event in the envelope, and this block is identical in hooks
# registered on eight different events — it cannot know which one it is on.
# `systemMessage` is event-agnostic and it reaches the operator rather than
# only the model, which is the right audience for "your guards are off".
# Measured too: adding it to an exit-2 hook leaves the refusal untouched —
# same `hook error:` tool result, same blocked write — and only adds a render.
# Nothing here changes what any hook detects, refuses, or exits with.
#
# The escaping is deliberately pure bash (verified on 3.2.57, the macOS system
# shell) and calls nothing external: this is the one code path in the engine
# that runs when the install is already known to be broken, so it must not
# depend on python3, jq, or any file it has just failed to find.
