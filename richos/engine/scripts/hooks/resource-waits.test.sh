# resource-waits.test.sh — NO JOB WAITS ON A SHARED RESOURCE FOR MORE THAN TEN
#                          MINUTES WITHOUT THE LEAD'S TURN END BEING REFUSED.
#
# The hook and its analyzer:
#   scripts/hooks/guard-resource-waits.sh   Stop, BLOCKING
#   scripts/lib/resource_waits.py           the three wait sources, the holder
#                                           facts, the writer (`waiting()`), and
#                                           the `list`, `wait`, `wait-over` CLI
#
# THE BRIEF'S THREE CONTROLS, FIRST: an 11-minute waiter blocks (RW10); a
# 9-minute one does not (RW11); a lock held by a running walk with no waiter
# does not (RW12). Every silence case is paired with a speech case on the same
# path, so a switched-off predicate cannot pass this suite.
#
#   RW01..RW03  the escalation classifier, calibrated on the real ledger
#   RW10..RW19  wait records and the slot queue, and who holds the VM
#   RW20..RW27  escalations: acks never clear, what does clear
#   RW30..RW36  the wrapper: teammates, re-fire, config, cannot-read, cost
#   RW40..RW42  the writers: `wait`, the waits directory, prune
#
# NOTHING HERE TOUCHES THE OPERATOR'S STATE: the waits directory, the test VM
# root, the escalation ledger and the workspace registry are all sandboxed, and
# every process this suite starts is captured at spawn and stopped by that pid.
# A synthetic "eleven-minute" wait is made by moving the gate's clock
# (RICHOS_RESOURCE_WAITS_NOW), never by waiting eleven minutes; process start
# times are always read against the real clock.
#
# THE CASE IDS ARE FOUR CHARACTERS AND NO ID IS A PREFIX OF ANOTHER, because the
# mutation harness greps `FAIL  <id>`.
#
# Usage: scripts/hooks/resource-waits.test.sh
# Exit:  0 all cases passed, 1 otherwise.
