# guard-resource-waits.sh — BLOCKING Stop hook. THE LEAD'S TURN DOES NOT END
#                           WHILE ANY JOB HAS WAITED MORE THAN TEN MINUTES ON A
#                           SHARED RESOURCE.
#
# THE CEO, 2026-09-25: "A free Mac is used whole; nothing waits in a line."
# THE CEO, 2026-09-27, after jobs waited hours that day for the single test VM:
#   "do I want the work to be BLOCKED AND PISSED AWAY like this because the
#   current worker might need the VM for a 5-second-long fart? Do I want HOURS
#   OF DEVELOPMENT TIME TO BE PISSED AWAY FOR EVERY 5-SECOND FART???" and
#   "how many more times will this exact fuckshit keep repeating itself?"
#
# The rule existed for two days with no mechanism, and three 90-minute wait
# escalations were each answered "keep waiting". This refuses the turn end and
# names the waiter, what it waits for, who holds the resource and whether the
# holder is actually using it right now.
#
# IT CLEARS ONLY WHEN THE WAIT ENDS. No acknowledgement, disposition or marker
# line clears it. The sources, what ends each wait, how the holder is read and
# what the gate cannot see are in scripts/lib/resource_waits.py; read that.
# This file is the wiring.
#
# IT DOES NOT STAND DOWN ON THE RE-FIRE (`stop_hook_active`), for the reason
#   guard-failure-type-answer.sh gives: the lead can act inside the same turn
#   (create the go-file, reclaim an idle slot, stop the holder, tell the waiter
#   to stop waiting). The bound is the host's own consecutive-block cap. When
#   the host ends a turn over it, the wait is still there and the next turn end
#   is refused for it in turn.
#
# FAIL-OPEN, LOUDLY, LIKE ITS SIBLINGS. A broken install, an unreadable
#   payload, a missing python3 or analyzer: the turn ends and the operator is
#   TOLD the check did not run. A wait source that cannot be read does not
#   block by itself; the refusal stands only on waits that WERE read.
#
# A TEAMMATE IS NEVER REFUSED. A payload carrying agent_id is not the lead.
#
# CONFIGURATION (orchestration.config of the governed repository):
#   CHECK_RESOURCE_WAITS=0     stands the gate down, announced, never silent
#   RESOURCE_WAIT_MINUTES=10   the threshold (the CEO's ten minutes)
#
# WHEN IT TAKES EFFECT
#   Hooks snapshot at session start. Installing this changes nothing in the
#   session that installs it; it begins enforcing in the NEXT session.
#
# Exit codes (Claude Code Stop convention):
#   0  no wait over the threshold, not evaluable (announced), stood down
#      (announced), or anything went wrong
#   2  BLOCKED: at least one wait is over the threshold

# --- ROOT RESOLUTION -------------------------------------------------------
# TWO ROOTS, NEVER ONE. The full contract, and why the old single-root
# resolution was wrong the moment the engine became loadable by reference,
# is in scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. This bootstrap block is byte-identical
# in every hook that needs a root; contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R asserts
# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
#
# THE BANNER BELOW GOES OUT ON TWO CHANNELS AND ONLY THE SECOND IS HEARD.
# Measured on Claude Code 2.1.270 (macOS, 2026-09-14) by registering one probe
# hook per channel on five events at once and reading the transcript back:
#
#   channel, exit 0     SessionStart  UserPromptSubmit  PreToolUse  PostToolUse  Stop
#   stderr              silent        silent            silent      silent       silent
#   stdout, plain text  model         model             silent      silent       silent
#   {"systemMessage"}   PERSON        PERSON            PERSON      PERSON       PERSON
#   additionalContext   model         model             model       model        model
#
# `silent` is not shorthand: the host records a `hook_success` attachment
# carrying the text in its stderr field and renders it to NO ONE. So a hook
# that could not find its own engine announced a dead enforcement layer
# exactly as loudly as a clean pass. Of the 60 files carrying this block, 35
# exit 2 here — where the host does render stderr, as the refusal reason — and
# 24 exit 0 and were inaudible. The 24 are the notices and observers, which is
# the trap: the hooks that must never block are the hooks nobody could hear.
#
# WHY `systemMessage` AND NOT `additionalContext`. additionalContext must name
# its own event in the envelope, and this block is identical in hooks
# registered on eight different events — it cannot know which one it is on.
# `systemMessage` is event-agnostic and it reaches the operator rather than
# only the model, which is the right audience for "your guards are off".
# Measured too: adding it to an exit-2 hook leaves the refusal untouched —
# same `hook error:` tool result, same blocked write — and only adds a render.
# Nothing here changes what any hook detects, refuses, or exits with.
#
# The escaping is deliberately pure bash (verified on 3.2.57, the macOS system
# shell) and calls nothing external: this is the one code path in the engine
# that runs when the install is already known to be broken, so it must not
# depend on python3, jq, or any file it has just failed to find.
