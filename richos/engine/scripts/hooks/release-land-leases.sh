# release-land-leases.sh: Stop hook. A land lease ends at its holder's turn end
# once the land is at rest (richos-hq spec r3 e6, F3; Frank G5 point 3).
#
# For every land lease THIS session holds (its holder, pid and start time, is an
# ancestor of this hook):
#   * at rest (no merge, cherry-pick, revert or rebase in progress, no unmerged
#     path, `git status --porcelain --untracked-files=no` empty, and main not
#     ahead of its upstream) -> released, silently;
#   * otherwise -> kept, and one systemMessage names the repository, the holder's
#     conversation, the age and what is unfinished, including which paths are
#     dirty, so a lease held up by ANOTHER writer's dirt can be told from the
#     holder's own unfinished work.
# A lease this session does not hold is never touched. It never blocks.
#
# WITH THE SWITCH OFF no lease exists (land-lease.sh takes none) and a repository
# whose launcher is off is skipped, so this hook prints nothing.
#
# IT SAYS SO WHEN IT CANNOT RUN (scripts/hooks/stop-hook-visibility.test.sh): a
# root it cannot resolve, or a release step that failed, reaches the operator as a
# systemMessage through scripts/lib/stop-hook-notice.sh, because a lease nobody
# releases holds every other conversation's land.
#
# UNEVALUATED-PAYLOAD-EXEMPT: payload-independent — the leases decide, by the
# holder's ancestry and the repositories' own Git state; the payload is read only
# to resolve the governed root, and a failure there is announced above.

# --- ROOT RESOLUTION -------------------------------------------------------
# TWO ROOTS, NEVER ONE. The full contract, and why the old single-root
# resolution was wrong the moment the engine became loadable by reference,
# is in scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. This bootstrap block is byte-identical
# in every hook that needs a root; contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R asserts
# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
#
# THE BANNER BELOW GOES OUT ON TWO CHANNELS AND ONLY THE SECOND IS HEARD.
# Measured on Claude Code 2.1.270 (macOS, 2026-09-14) by registering one probe
# hook per channel on five events at once and reading the transcript back:
#
#   channel, exit 0     SessionStart  UserPromptSubmit  PreToolUse  PostToolUse  Stop
#   stderr              silent        silent            silent      silent       silent
#   stdout, plain text  model         model             silent      silent       silent
#   {"systemMessage"}   PERSON        PERSON            PERSON      PERSON       PERSON
#   additionalContext   model         model             model       model        model
#
# `silent` is not shorthand: the host records a `hook_success` attachment
# carrying the text in its stderr field and renders it to NO ONE. So a hook
# that could not find its own engine announced a dead enforcement layer
# exactly as loudly as a clean pass. Of the 60 files carrying this block, 35
# exit 2 here — where the host does render stderr, as the refusal reason — and
# 24 exit 0 and were inaudible. The 24 are the notices and observers, which is
# the trap: the hooks that must never block are the hooks nobody could hear.
#
# WHY `systemMessage` AND NOT `additionalContext`. additionalContext must name
# its own event in the envelope, and this block is identical in hooks
# registered on eight different events — it cannot know which one it is on.
# `systemMessage` is event-agnostic and it reaches the operator rather than
# only the model, which is the right audience for "your guards are off".
# Measured too: adding it to an exit-2 hook leaves the refusal untouched —
# same `hook error:` tool result, same blocked write — and only adds a render.
# Nothing here changes what any hook detects, refuses, or exits with.
#
# The escaping is deliberately pure bash (verified on 3.2.57, the macOS system
# shell) and calls nothing external: this is the one code path in the engine
# that runs when the install is already known to be broken, so it must not
# depend on python3, jq, or any file it has just failed to find.
