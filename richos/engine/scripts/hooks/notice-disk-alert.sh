# notice-disk-alert.sh — RICH IS TOLD, AT EVERY SESSION START AND EVERY TURN
#                        END, UNTIL IT CLEARS.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THIS IS
# ===========================================================================
# CEO, 2026-09-18 (ceo-decisions §54), verbatim: "...if the clean-up fails or
# impossible for some reason, then Rich must get a MASSIVE ALERT about it and get
# on with manually deleting the garbage if it fails to be deleted automatically."
#
# The launchd timer takes the readings and notifies the CEO. THIS is the other
# half — the half that reaches Rich inside the session, where the work happens.
# It reads `disk-watchdog.sh --alert` and says nothing at all when that says
# nothing, which on a healthy machine is always.
#
# Registered on BOTH SessionStart and Stop, and it renders differently on each,
# because the two channels are not the same shape:
#
#   SessionStart — systemMessage + additionalContext, which take a BLOCK. Rich
#                  gets the whole alert: every volume, every stuck path, the top
#                  consumers, the classification and what to do.
#   Stop         — ONE LINE. The host prefixes each line with "Stop says: ", so
#                  a block renders as noise; the turn end gets a summary and
#                  points at the full reading.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY THIS ONE DEFEATS THE DE-DUPLICATION EVERY OTHER Stop NOTICE HONORS
# ===========================================================================
# stop-hook-notice.sh exists because "a condition repeated under every turn is a
# condition the eye is trained to skip", and almost every caller is right to
# announce on entry and then go quiet.
#
# THIS CALLER IS THE EXCEPTION AND THE CEO NAMED IT: the alert is "repeated every
# turn until the condition clears". That is an explicit instruction to be
# wallpaper until somebody fixes it, and it is the correct trade for this one
# condition — a disk with 20 GB left does not become less urgent because it was
# mentioned last turn, and the failure mode of going quiet is that the machine
# stops working mid-task.
#
# It is done through stop_notice_abnormal_recurring with a one-second interval
# rather than by bypassing the library, so the announcement is still LEDGERED and
# still visible to everything that audits Stop notices. One second means "every
# turn" in practice, and saying so here is cheaper than a private code path.
#
# ===========================================================================
# IT NEVER BLOCKS AND IT NEVER COSTS A DF
# ===========================================================================
# `--alert` reads the state file the launchd job writes; it takes no reading of
# its own and, critically, never WRITES the state file. A turn end that moved the
# reading forward would destroy the baseline the 20 GB drop arithmetic subtracts
# from, silently turning a 15-minute rate alarm into a per-turn-end one that can
# never see a drop. disk-watchdog.test.sh W14 is that property.
#
# Every exit is 0. A notice that takes the session down with it is worse than no
# notice.

# --- ROOT RESOLUTION -------------------------------------------------------
# TWO ROOTS, NEVER ONE. The full contract, and why the old single-root
# resolution was wrong the moment the engine became loadable by reference,
# is in scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. This bootstrap block is byte-identical
# in every hook that needs a root; contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R asserts
# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
#
# THE BANNER BELOW GOES OUT ON TWO CHANNELS AND ONLY THE SECOND IS HEARD.
# Measured on Claude Code 2.1.270 (macOS, 2026-09-14) by registering one probe
# hook per channel on five events at once and reading the transcript back:
#
#   channel, exit 0     SessionStart  UserPromptSubmit  PreToolUse  PostToolUse  Stop
#   stderr              silent        silent            silent      silent       silent
#   stdout, plain text  model         model             silent      silent       silent
#   {"systemMessage"}   PERSON        PERSON            PERSON      PERSON       PERSON
#   additionalContext   model         model             model       model        model
#
# `silent` is not shorthand: the host records a `hook_success` attachment
# carrying the text in its stderr field and renders it to NO ONE. So a hook
# that could not find its own engine announced a dead enforcement layer
# exactly as loudly as a clean pass. Of the 60 files carrying this block, 35
# exit 2 here — where the host does render stderr, as the refusal reason — and
# 24 exit 0 and were inaudible. The 24 are the notices and observers, which is
# the trap: the hooks that must never block are the hooks nobody could hear.
#
# WHY `systemMessage` AND NOT `additionalContext`. additionalContext must name
# its own event in the envelope, and this block is identical in hooks
# registered on eight different events — it cannot know which one it is on.
# `systemMessage` is event-agnostic and it reaches the operator rather than
# only the model, which is the right audience for "your guards are off".
# Measured too: adding it to an exit-2 hook leaves the refusal untouched —
# same `hook error:` tool result, same blocked write — and only adds a render.
# Nothing here changes what any hook detects, refuses, or exits with.
#
# The escaping is deliberately pure bash (verified on 3.2.57, the macOS system
# shell) and calls nothing external: this is the one code path in the engine
# that runs when the install is already known to be broken, so it must not
# depend on python3, jq, or any file it has just failed to find.

    # ===================================================================
    # THE LINE THE CEO ASKED ABOUT WAS WRITTEN HERE
    # ===================================================================
    # 2026-09-19, verbatim: "And what is this all about: MASSIVE ALERT — DISK:
    # 218 path(s) could not be deleted (delete BY HAND) | 13.9 GB in 4122
    # place(s) NOTHING WILL EVER COLLECT | 11.4 GB in 2 place(s) UNDECIDABLE —
    # no run will clear it".
    #
    # Three clauses, and each was a different thing wearing the same words:
    # 200 of the 218 were a defect in the sweeper's own delete loop and 18 were
    # directories the kernel owns; 12.8 of the 13.9 GB were our campaign roots,
    # each already printing the command that reclaims it, added to 1.15 GB of
    # other programs' temporary files; the 11.4 GB had been deleted by hand an
    # hour before the line was printed. He could act on none of it, and it was
    # repeated every turn.
    #
    # SO THE SUMMARY NOW SPLITS THE SAME WAY THE BLOCK DOES. Only what a person
    # must ACT on reaches this line, and only an ALARM wears the words MASSIVE
    # ALERT. Another program's temporary files never appear here at all: they
    # are in the SessionStart block, where they are information, and a turn-end
    # line about files nobody may touch is the definition of wallpaper.
