#
# REFUSES A BRIEF, A CODE WRITE OR A SPAWN THAT ASSOCIATES THE PHONE SURFACE
# WITH A HOME-NETWORK PATH.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE RULING, AND THE FAILURE IT WAS GIVEN FOR
# ===========================================================================
# ceo-decisions.md §61 (2026-09-18 20:40Z), in his words:
#
#     "the new working definition for a mobile app or PWA is this: it's an app
#      that lets the user use RichOS (in some way) while being on the go and
#      away from office i.e. outside the home network. Because any mobile app
#      or PWA is utterly useless within the home network."
#
# And the addendum that ordered this file, 2026-09-19 ~15:05Z:
#
#     "How many more times will any 'home network' related shit be associated
#      with a phone or built for phone?"
#
# The answer is zero, "and it is enforced rather than remembered".
#
# WHAT HAPPENED, because it decides this file's shape. §61 was ruled on the
# 18th. On the 19th three briefs kept and repaired the phone flow's home path —
# the self-signed certificate, the trust page on 8444, the sixteen certificate
# taps, the .local origin, the route chooser — and one of them asserted a
# ruling that does not exist. Two engineers and a design walk were spent on it
# before he asked the question above. Nothing was broken: the rule was in the
# record, in his own words, and nobody read it at the moment of writing.
#
# A rule enforced by remembering lasts exactly as long as the remembering. This
# is the same finding the row-currency contract and the staging gate were built
# from, and it is why this is a hook and not a paragraph.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT IT REFUSES AND WHAT IT PASSES — THE REAL SENTENCES OF 2026-09-19
# ===========================================================================
# The corpus below is not illustrative. These are the actual texts, and
# guard-no-home-network-phone.test.sh drives every one of them.
#
# REFUSED — echo-brief-the-chosen-route-reaches-the-backend-2026-09-19.md
# (the brief the addendum names), two sites:
#
#     "§61 (2026-09-18): two paths, the Tailscale path first and *"..."*; the
#      At-home path stays."
#
#     "... returns the home plan when the user said at-home, even on a Mac with
#      a valid tailnet certificate ... Do not remove the At-home option, and do
#      not fix it in the UI."
#
# The first is the false premise itself. The second is the instruction that
# came out of it. Both are prescriptions with no statement anywhere on the line
# that the home path is going away.
#
# PASSED — ceo-decisions.md §61 and its addendum. It is dense with every term
# this guard looks for — "home network", "At home only", self-signed, 8444,
# sixteen, .local — and it passes, because every one of those sites sits in a
# block that also says "utterly useless within the home network", "it is being
# removed", "an engine guard refuses". THE RULING MUST BE WRITEABLE. A guard
# that forbids the record of the thing it forbids is the exact shape that cost
# this engine fourteen unexplained lines in two vendored skills on 2026-08-30:
# the guard caused the divergence, forbade the repair, and forbade the note
# explaining it.
#
# PASSED — echo-brief-remove-the-at-home-route-2026-09-19.md, the removal brief
# that was running when this was written. It names the home path in nine
# separate blocks, quotes the offending sentence of the refused brief back at
# the engineer, and passes all nine times: every block carries "is removed",
# "leave the product", "no ... option", "is not a second path", or the quoted
# form. Quoting a refused sentence is how a mistake gets recorded, and it is
# never the mistake.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE TEST: TWO CONJUNCTS, AND A THIRD THAT LETS THE RECORD THROUGH
# ===========================================================================
#   (a) PHONE SURFACE — document-level. Does this text name the phone at all:
#       phone, mobile, PWA, pairing, pair=. Or does the file PATH put it on
#       that surface: a phone/ or web-app/ segment, or a phone*.<ext> file.
#       Cheap, broad, and deliberately so: it is a jurisdiction question, not
#       the finding. The path test is by SEGMENT and is NOT the word-level
#       pattern pointed at a path — that version made every file in the tree a
#       phone file whenever an ancestor directory had "phone" in its name, and
#       case E1 caught it by living in a temp directory named after this guard.
#
#   (b) A HOME PATH — block-level, and this is the finding. Ten STRONG terms
#       (home network, at-home, "at home <path-noun>", AtHome, home plan, a
#       <host>.local origin, 8444, trust QR, certificate profile, Remove
#       Profile) and two WEAK ones (sixteen, self-signed) that refuse alone and
#       count only in pairs. `sixteen` is a number word and `self-signed` is
#       ordinary TLS vocabulary; one of either, by itself, is a sentence about
#       something else.
#
#   (c) NOT ALREADY SAYING SO. A block that carries a removal or negation —
#       removed, removal, no longer, nothing, useless, outside the home
#       network, is not, never, no, refuses, fails, zero, leaves the product —
#       is a block talking ABOUT the home path rather than building one.
#
# THREE THINGS THE MEASUREMENT DECIDED, none of them guessed:
#
#   1. "at home" SPACED needs a path noun after it; "at-home" HYPHENATED does
#      not. Without that, `urban-brief-tailscale-how-to-screens-2026-09-19.md`
#      was refused for "the name stops resolving when Tailscale is off,
#      including at home" — a statement of a Tailscale LIMIT — and
#      `sage-brief-phone-channel-on-the-users-device-2026-09-18.md` for "at
#      home, from the couch, on Wi-Fi". Neither builds anything.
#
#   2. IN PROSE, SCOPE IS THE BLOCK, NOT THE LINE OR THE SENTENCE, and neither
#      end of that is arbitrary. Per SENTENCE, the addendum's own quoted question —
#      "...be associated with a phone or built for phone?" — is refused, and
#      the ruling cannot be written down. Per LINE, route1's two sites are
#      exempted by a "NEVER" that belongs to a different clause about Tailscale
#      identities, and the brief the ruling names passes. A block is what one
#      author wrote as one thought; hard-wrapping is a formatting choice and
#      must not change a verdict, so wrapped lines join and a heading, a list
#      item or a blank line starts a new one.
#
#      IN CODE, SCOPE IS THE LINE. Source is already line-structured, and the
#      block rule exists only to undo hard-wrapping. Joining adjacent source
#      lines is actively wrong: in the real phone.js markup the two route
#      buttons are adjacent, the first reads "Anywhere, including away from
#      home" — which is a NEGATION cue — and the second is `>At home only<`.
#      Scored as one block, the option this whole ruling is about ships under
#      the exemption of the option above it.
#
#   3. QUOTED MATTER IS SOMEBODY ELSE'S — and ONE of the four strippers is
#      proven by real text, which is stated here rather than implied.
#
#      Bare "..." IS. Stripped in PROSE ONLY, and removing it turns three
#      cases red: the whole removal brief is refused, and so is a sentence
#      quoting the refused sentence. In CODE it is deliberately NOT stripped,
#      because there a double-quoted span is a string literal and is exactly
#      the copy at issue — `route = "at-home"` must stay reachable.
#
#      The CURLY pair, the record's *"..."* emphasis-quote idiom and inline
#      code spans are DEFENSE IN DEPTH. Disabling any of them changes no
#      verdict on any of the 269 documents or on any real fixture, because the
#      provenance apparatus that emits curly quotes also annotates every one
#      with "nothing in scope sources it" or "this run is NOT in that file" —
#      a negation, in the same block. They are kept because the *"..."* form is
#      how this record quotes the CEO and a future ruling need not come
#      wrapped in a negation, and their cases in the suite are marked
#      CONSTRUCTED so nobody later mistakes them for measured ones.
#
#      An earlier draft of this header said curly-stripping fixed the one
#      false positive of the first measured pass. It did not; BLOCK SCOPE did.
#      The claim was plausible, was written from memory of the fix rather than
#      from a measurement of it, and survived until a mutant could not kill it.
#
# ===========================================================================
# MEASURED, ON REAL TEXT, BEFORE IT WAS WIRED
# ===========================================================================
# Every brief in richos-hq/docs/briefs (248 .md files) plus the 20 spawn
# prompts of the session that ordered this, plus §61 itself: 269 documents
# driven through this file as real Write and Agent payloads. SEVEN refused.
#
#   echo-brief-the-chosen-route-reaches-the-backend-2026-09-19.md  + its prompt
#   ray-brief-candidate-14-mac-and-android-walk-2026-09-19.md      + its prompt
#       "walk candidate .14 — the At-home route now serves the home plan"
#   urban-brief-phone-flow-signoff-rewalk-2026-09-19.md            + its prompt
#       "your call whether the At-home route gets it too"
#   sage-brief-phone-reach-from-anywhere-bundled-2026-09-18.md
#       "Keep the home-network design of your revised plan as the floor"
#
# Six of the seven are the three home-path briefs of 2026-09-19 and their spawn
# prompts — the engineers, the walk, and the signoff re-walk that §61's
# addendum is about. The seventh is stated rather than glossed: it was written
# on 2026-09-18, BEFORE §61 was ruled at 20:40Z, when keeping the home-network
# design was the correct instruction. The rule is right and the document
# predates it.
#
# NOTHING ELSE FIRED. Not one of the other 262, and no non-phone document can
# ever reach conjunct (b). Two of those 262 were written by the live session
# WHILE this guard was being measured, and both passed.
#
# Reproduce it before changing any pattern here: build a Write or Agent payload
# per document and pipe it in. The classifier is this file's own python3 block,
# so the measurement is of the shipped rule and not of a model of it — which is
# the difference between this number and a plausible one.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE ESCAPE HATCH IS A QUOTATION, NOT A MARKER
# ===========================================================================
#     ceo-ruled-home-network: §<N> — "<his verbatim sentence>"
#
# on its own line in the prompt or in the new content. It needs three things
# and a bare marker exempts nothing:
#
#   * a section token (§61, §61.1, "section 61"),
#   * a quoted sentence of at least 25 characters,
#   * and THE SECTION MUST EXIST in the CEO's record. The guard opens
#     wiki/ceo-decisions.md — located through cr_resolve(), the engine's single
#     declaration of where his rulings live — and looks for the heading. A
#     citation of a section that is not there is refused BY NAME, because that
#     is precisely what happened: a brief asserted "§61 keeps both" and §61
#     says the opposite. Half the value of this hatch is being made to open the
#     file.
#
# Where the record cannot be located at all the citation is accepted on its
# shape and the log says UNVERIFIED. "I cannot check" is never "forbidden".
# Accepted uses append to <entity root>/.claude/state/home-network-acks.log,
# beside stale-staging-acks.log and the other opt-out ledgers, so a habit of
# waiving is visible rather than invisible.
#
# WHY A QUOTATION AND NOT A REASON, unlike every sibling hatch in this engine.
# The failure was not a thin justification. It was a CONFIDENT one — "§61 keeps
# both" — invented in good faith by somebody who had not reopened §61. A reason
# field would have been filled in just as confidently. A citation that must
# resolve against the file cannot be.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE SELF-EXEMPTION, DECLARED RATHER THAN HIDDEN
# ===========================================================================
# This file, its suite, its mutation harness and its corpus are exempt BY
# BASENAME. Everything above quotes the sentences the guard refuses, so without
# this the guard could not be authored, tested or corrected — and a guard that
# cannot be repaired is removed. It is four names, it is checked against the
# BASENAME and never a directory, and the list is here rather than in a config
# key so that adding to it is an edit somebody reviews.
#
# NOTE THAT ceo-decisions.md IS NOT ON THAT LIST, deliberately. The record
# passes on merit — proven, by driving §61 and its addendum through this guard
# in the suite — which is a much stronger claim than passing by path.
#
# ===========================================================================
# FAIL OPEN, AND LOUDLY
# ===========================================================================
#   NOT ADOPTED (no orchestration.config)     -> STAND DOWN, silent.
#   HOME_NETWORK_PHONE_GUARD="off"            -> STAND DOWN, silent. A
#     declaration is a choice somebody made and recorded; nagging about it is
#     how a switch gets set and forgotten.
#   NO PHONE SIGNAL / NO HOME PATH            -> SILENT. Always, and this is
#     262 of the 269 measured documents.
#   PAYLOAD UNPARSEABLE, python3 MISSING      -> ALLOW + ANNOUNCE. This guard
#     cannot read the content OR the hatch from such a call, so refusing would
#     block a write the operator has no way to permit.
#   THE CEO RECORD UNREADABLE                 -> the hatch is accepted on its
#     shape and logged UNVERIFIED. It NEVER turns a pass into a refusal.
#
# The one thing that is NOT fail-open: scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh missing.
# That is the shared bootstrap's contract and probe Layer R asserts every
# rooted hook carries it byte-identically.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY BOTH SURFACES, AND WHY NOT A THIRD
# ===========================================================================
# The ruling names three things — "any brief, code write or spawn". A brief is
# a Write, code is a Write, a dispatch is an Agent call, so two registrations
# cover all three. PreToolUse[Bash] was REJECTED: a brief reaches disk through
# Write long before any `git commit` names it, and a Bash rule would have to
# match every shape of "write a file with a shell", which is an open class.
# A Stop-hook notice was REJECTED for the reason every notice in this engine
# gets rejected when the act is irreversible: it reports a brief that has
# already been dispatched from.
#
# NOTE: hooks are snapshotted at session start. This one is INERT until the
# next session — it assumes nothing about being live in the session that adds
# it, and the session that added it is the session that wrote the three briefs.

set -eo pipefail
# --- ROOT RESOLUTION -------------------------------------------------------
# TWO ROOTS, NEVER ONE. The full contract, and why the old single-root
# resolution was wrong the moment the engine became loadable by reference,
# is in scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. This bootstrap block is byte-identical
# in every hook that needs a root; contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R asserts
# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
#
# THE BANNER BELOW GOES OUT ON TWO CHANNELS AND ONLY THE SECOND IS HEARD.
# Measured on Claude Code 2.1.270 (macOS, 2026-09-14) by registering one probe
# hook per channel on five events at once and reading the transcript back:
#
#   channel, exit 0     SessionStart  UserPromptSubmit  PreToolUse  PostToolUse  Stop
#   stderr              silent        silent            silent      silent       silent
#   stdout, plain text  model         model             silent      silent       silent
#   {"systemMessage"}   PERSON        PERSON            PERSON      PERSON       PERSON
#   additionalContext   model         model             model       model        model
#
# `silent` is not shorthand: the host records a `hook_success` attachment
# carrying the text in its stderr field and renders it to NO ONE. So a hook
# that could not find its own engine announced a dead enforcement layer
# exactly as loudly as a clean pass. Of the 60 files carrying this block, 35
# exit 2 here — where the host does render stderr, as the refusal reason — and
# 24 exit 0 and were inaudible. The 24 are the notices and observers, which is
# the trap: the hooks that must never block are the hooks nobody could hear.
#
# WHY `systemMessage` AND NOT `additionalContext`. additionalContext must name
# its own event in the envelope, and this block is identical in hooks
# registered on eight different events — it cannot know which one it is on.
# `systemMessage` is event-agnostic and it reaches the operator rather than
# only the model, which is the right audience for "your guards are off".
# Measured too: adding it to an exit-2 hook leaves the refusal untouched —
# same `hook error:` tool result, same blocked write — and only adds a render.
# Nothing here changes what any hook detects, refuses, or exits with.
#
# The escaping is deliberately pure bash (verified on 3.2.57, the macOS system
# shell) and calls nothing external: this is the one code path in the engine
# that runs when the install is already known to be broken, so it must not
# depend on python3, jq, or any file it has just failed to find.
