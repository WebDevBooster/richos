# mutation-focus-declared.test.sh — a mutant's suite run stops at the mutant's
# named FAIL line, in every harness that can honestly claim it.
#
# The finding (hunt 2026-09-29 part 3, number 9): a mutation harness proves a
# property is load-bearing by removing it and watching ONE named case go red, yet
# most harnesses ran the suite's WHOLE body for every mutant, so the dialect
# suite ran 22 times to be read at one line each. The shared harness already had
# the answer (`mutation_focus stop-at-want`, scripts/lib/stop-at-line.py); these
# did not use it. This suite proves:
#
#   S1  every harness on the shared loop that can claim it declares the focus
#   S2  every harness with its own mutant loop that can claim it runs its suite
#       through mutant_suite_run, and no longer runs the whole suite unfocused
#   H1  mutant_suite_run stops a suite at the named line, in seconds, and keeps
#       the output written up to it
#   H2  ... and when the named line never appears, the run is judged exactly as
#       it was before (the suite's own exit status, nothing stopped)
#   H3  ... and RICHOS_MUTATION_FOCUS=off turns the stop off
#   H4  --boundary never stops at a longer case (`D1` at `FAIL  D14`), as a
#       witness test ending in `\b` would not, and does stop at `FAIL  D1 `
#
# THE NINE THAT WERE LEFT OUT (finding 9, partial in the v2 re-check) are in
# CUSTOM now. They were held back on the claim that a substring stop would
# loosen their witness test; read, only one test carries a boundary
# (claim-capability-delivery's `\b`, which --boundary reproduces). ceo-asks,
# ceo-ruled, claim-roles, turn-manifest, unasked-deferral and waiver-repetition
# escape a TRIMMED want with no boundary, which a fixed-string stop on the
# trimmed want equals; idle-land and mechanical-findings grep the want
# unescaped, which a fixed-string stop is stricter than.
# NOT COVERED, STATED: guard-row-currency-commits, guard-worktree-isolation and
# guard-worktree-removal were not in the finding's inventory.
#
# Run directly: scripts/hooks/mutation-focus-declared.test.sh
# Exit 0 = all cases pass; exit 1 = at least one failure.
