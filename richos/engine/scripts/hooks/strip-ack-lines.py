"""Keep acknowledgment lines away from the teammate that is spawned.

The spawn guards (PreToolUse[Agent]) read acknowledgment lines such as
`owned-state-ack: <reason>` from the Agent call's prompt. They tell the guard
something and the teammate nothing about its job. The host runs every matching
PreToolUse hook in parallel and hands each the ORIGINAL tool input, so this
transformer can return an updatedInput with those lines removed while every guard
still reads them from the original. The teammate boots on the stripped prompt.

Lines the teammate needs stay: `cross-repo-worktree:` names its workspace.
Only whole lines that begin with one of the prefixes below are removed (the same
anchoring the guards use), so a sentence that merely mentions one is untouched.
