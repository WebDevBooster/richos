# guard-record-owner-memory.sh: PreToolUse, a module of the Write chain of
# dispatch-pretooluse.sh. Once the RichOS app owns his record, his plain terminal
# does not write his memory directory (daily-driver plan step 8; two-installs
# spec points 25 and 26).
#
# THE SWITCH is the record's owner line, ROW_RECORD_OWNER="app <memory dir>" in
# the record's own .row-currency (scripts/lib/row-currency.sh, rc_record_owner).
# The record is found from the seat: the seat's .row-currency is the record
# (record form) or points at it (peer form, ROW_RECORD_REPO), read from the MAIN
# checkouts either way. With no owner line, which is the state until cut-over,
# this guard refuses nothing and says nothing. Deleting the line reverses it.
#
# With the line present it refuses a Write, Edit, MultiEdit or NotebookEdit whose
# target is inside the named memory directory, when the caller is his terminal
# or cannot be identified. The app's own lead passes. Who is calling is
# scripts/lib/record_owner.py's answer: the platform's own session record for the
# nearest Claude process in the call's ancestry (pid plus kernel start time,
# entrypoint `sdk-*` for the app), never a name, a path or a working directory.
#
# NOT COVERED, stated rather than implied: a Bash command that writes into the
# directory (`echo >> MEMORY.md`), exactly as the operator claim's memory rule;
# and a session whose seat declares no row-currency contract at all.
#
# A declaration that is BROKEN is announced and the write passes: the landing
# guard already refuses every landing over a broken declaration, and a typo in
# an unrelated key must not be what stops his memory.

# --- ROOT RESOLUTION -------------------------------------------------------
# TWO ROOTS, NEVER ONE. The full contract, and why the old single-root
# resolution was wrong the moment the engine became loadable by reference,
# is in scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. This bootstrap block is byte-identical
# in every hook that needs a root; contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R asserts
# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
#
# THE BANNER BELOW GOES OUT ON TWO CHANNELS AND ONLY THE SECOND IS HEARD.
# Measured on Claude Code 2.1.270 (macOS, 2026-09-14) by registering one probe
# hook per channel on five events at once and reading the transcript back:
#
#   channel, exit 0     SessionStart  UserPromptSubmit  PreToolUse  PostToolUse  Stop
#   stderr              silent        silent            silent      silent       silent
#   stdout, plain text  model         model             silent      silent       silent
#   {"systemMessage"}   PERSON        PERSON            PERSON      PERSON       PERSON
#   additionalContext   model         model             model       model        model
#
# `silent` is not shorthand: the host records a `hook_success` attachment
# carrying the text in its stderr field and renders it to NO ONE. So a hook
# that could not find its own engine announced a dead enforcement layer
# exactly as loudly as a clean pass. Of the 60 files carrying this block, 35
# exit 2 here — where the host does render stderr, as the refusal reason — and
# 24 exit 0 and were inaudible. The 24 are the notices and observers, which is
# the trap: the hooks that must never block are the hooks nobody could hear.
#
# WHY `systemMessage` AND NOT `additionalContext`. additionalContext must name
# its own event in the envelope, and this block is identical in hooks
# registered on eight different events — it cannot know which one it is on.
# `systemMessage` is event-agnostic and it reaches the operator rather than
# only the model, which is the right audience for "your guards are off".
# Measured too: adding it to an exit-2 hook leaves the refusal untouched —
# same `hook error:` tool result, same blocked write — and only adds a render.
# Nothing here changes what any hook detects, refuses, or exits with.
#
# The escaping is deliberately pure bash (verified on 3.2.57, the macOS system
# shell) and calls nothing external: this is the one code path in the engine
# that runs when the install is already known to be broken, so it must not
# depend on python3, jq, or any file it has just failed to find.
