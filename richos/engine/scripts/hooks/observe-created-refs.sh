# ===========================================================================
#   "A cc/ or native workspace with no registration, and ANY BRANCH AN AGENT
#    CREATED, counts as finished work of an ended session"          (point 3)
#   "every workspace and branch it has is deleted, as one. None is left
#    behind."                                                       (point 10)
#
# A ref an agent created is the agent's; a ref that already existed never is.
# CREATION is therefore the fact to record, and a tool call is the only moment
# the platform vouches for with an agent's id. It has two halves:
#
#   PreToolUse (matcherless)   guard-sealed-worktree.sh -> barrier() ->
#                              snapshot_refs(): what the agent's repositories
#                              held when this call STARTED.
#   PostToolUse (matcherless)  THIS HOOK -> observe() -> observe_created_refs():
#                              what is there now. A ref that is new AND carries
#                              this agent's own unlanded work was created by it.
#
# BOTH HALVES CARRY `tool_use_id`, AND IT IS THE SAME STRING FOR ONE CALL. That
# is what keys the window, and it is why this hook passes the WHOLE payload
# through rather than the agent id alone: an agent's own calls overlap, so one
# slot per agent lost a window every time two were open at once, and a ref
# created in the second was attributed to nobody. See mega-lander/workspaces.py,
# "ONE WINDOW PER TOOL CALL, KEYED BY THE CALL".
#
# THE PRE HALF ALREADY EXISTED AND THE POST HALF DID NOT, which is the whole
# reason attribution had to be read from POSSESSION (a ref checked out at the
# agent's own workspace path) until 2026-09-12 — and possession left the stray
# (`git branch spare` checks nothing out), the side branch (committed to and
# switched away from) and the borrowed branch (pre-existing, merely checked out,
# then deleted by a discard). mega-lander/workspaces.py carries the four filters
# that keep co-occurrence in time from being mistaken for authorship.
#
# IT RECORDS A FACT AND NEVER REFUSES ANYTHING. Exit 0 always, on every path:
# this hook fires after the work is already done, so a fact it could not record
# must never be allowed to look like a failed tool call. A missed observation
# costs one window of attribution, which under-attributes, which loses nothing.
#
# THE LEAD'S OWN CALLS COST ALMOST NOTHING. A payload with no `agent_id` is the
# lead's, and it is answered by one grep before python3 is started at all — this
# hook is registered against EVERY tool, so the lead's path has to be cheap.
#
# NOTE: hooks are snapshotted at session start. This hook is inert until the next
# session and assumes nothing about being live in the session that adds it.

# --- ROOT RESOLUTION -------------------------------------------------------
# TWO ROOTS, NEVER ONE. The full contract, and why the old single-root
# resolution was wrong the moment the engine became loadable by reference,
# is in scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. This bootstrap block is byte-identical
# in every hook that needs a root; contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R asserts
# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
#
# THE BANNER BELOW GOES OUT ON TWO CHANNELS AND ONLY THE SECOND IS HEARD.
# Measured on Claude Code 2.1.270 (macOS, 2026-09-14) by registering one probe
# hook per channel on five events at once and reading the transcript back:
#
#   channel, exit 0     SessionStart  UserPromptSubmit  PreToolUse  PostToolUse  Stop
#   stderr              silent        silent            silent      silent       silent
#   stdout, plain text  model         model             silent      silent       silent
#   {"systemMessage"}   PERSON        PERSON            PERSON      PERSON       PERSON
#   additionalContext   model         model             model       model        model
#
# `silent` is not shorthand: the host records a `hook_success` attachment
# carrying the text in its stderr field and renders it to NO ONE. So a hook
# that could not find its own engine announced a dead enforcement layer
# exactly as loudly as a clean pass. Of the 60 files carrying this block, 35
# exit 2 here — where the host does render stderr, as the refusal reason — and
# 24 exit 0 and were inaudible. The 24 are the notices and observers, which is
# the trap: the hooks that must never block are the hooks nobody could hear.
#
# WHY `systemMessage` AND NOT `additionalContext`. additionalContext must name
# its own event in the envelope, and this block is identical in hooks
# registered on eight different events — it cannot know which one it is on.
# `systemMessage` is event-agnostic and it reaches the operator rather than
# only the model, which is the right audience for "your guards are off".
# Measured too: adding it to an exit-2 hook leaves the refusal untouched —
# same `hook error:` tool result, same blocked write — and only adds a render.
# Nothing here changes what any hook detects, refuses, or exits with.
#
# The escaping is deliberately pure bash (verified on 3.2.57, the macOS system
# shell) and calls nothing external: this is the one code path in the engine
# that runs when the install is already known to be broken, so it must not
# depend on python3, jq, or any file it has just failed to find.
