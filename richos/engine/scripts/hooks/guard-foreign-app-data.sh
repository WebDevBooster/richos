# guard-foreign-app-data.sh: PreToolUse[Bash] rule (a module of dispatch-pretooluse.sh).
# NEVER ANOTHER APP'S DATA, and never a walk of the whole home folder.
#
# The CEO, 2026-09-25: "a regular user of RichOS is not expected to keep clicking
# those things", about "python3.14 would like to access data from other apps". The
# cause on his Mac was the disk watchdog's `du` (fixed at the source, disk-watchdog.py).
# THIS rule is for the door a source fix cannot close: a command an agent composes at
# runtime. Inside a RichOS session that command runs as a child of RichOS.app, so
# `find ~ -name x` makes macOS ask the USER whether RichOS may access data from other
# apps, and a refusal here is the only thing standing between that habit and the prompt.
#
# It refuses exactly two shapes (the rule and its reasons are in
# scripts/lib/foreign_app_data.py, bash_verdict):
#   (a) a path under another app's Containers or Group Containers folder (our own
#       com.richos.* containers pass);
#   (b) find, du, ls -R, grep -r or rg rooted at the home folder, its Library, /Users or /
#       deep enough to open an app's container (find -maxdepth 3 from ~ passes).
# Measured against 166,915 distinct Bash commands in this Mac's transcripts: see
# guard-foreign-app-data.test.sh's header for the count and how it was taken.
#
# `# foreign-app-data-exempt: <reason>` on the command passes it and is logged to
# ${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/state/foreign-app-data-acks.log. A bare marker exempts nothing.
#
# IT IS A TEXT MATCH AND IT LEAKS (a script, a variable, `sh -c "$X"`). Its job is to stop
# the habitual command, not an adversary. Any error in the check is a pass.
