# guard-failure-type-answer.sh — BLOCKING Stop hook. A turn that began with his
# message putting "type" and "failure" together does not end until:
#
#   (a) the failure register was READ in this turn,
#   (b) the reply NAMES a type from it, `Type <N>: <heading, verbatim>`, for an
#       N the register has (or says "new type" and the new heading is
#       committed), and
#   (c) the register has a COMMIT made during this turn.
#
# The refusal names exactly which of the three is missing, and the path, the
# repository and the next free numbers it needs to supply them.
#
# Its partner is failure-type-lookup.sh on UserPromptSubmit, which puts the
# rule and the register's live type list in front of the lead first. The
# predicates, the measurement and the list of what neither can guarantee are in
# scripts/lib/failure-type.py; read that. This file is the wiring.
#
# THE FAILURE, PRECISELY
#   2026-09-26. Asked what type of failure something was, the lead answered from
#   recall. That morning the operator had needed three attempts to get the same
#   question answered from the register, and the lead had promised it would
#   never again take more than one. The promise was a sentence, with nothing
#   behind it, and it broke the same day. A rule enforced by attention lasts
#   exactly as long as the attention.
#
# IT DOES NOT STAND DOWN ON THE RE-FIRE. Most Stop guards here return 0 when
#   `stop_hook_active` is true, so each refuses a turn at most once. That is a
#   pattern, not a rule (guard-workspace-gate.sh keeps refusing too), and this
#   gate breaks it on purpose: every one of its three steps is something the
#   lead can do inside the same turn in under a minute. The bound is the host's
#   own consecutive-block cap, CLAUDE_CODE_STOP_HOOK_BLOCK_CAP, default 8 in
#   2.1.283. When the host does end a turn over it, the obligation is carried in
#   the entity's state into the NEXT turn, which is refused for it in turn.
#
# FAIL-OPEN, LOUDLY, LIKE ITS SIBLINGS. A broken install, an unreadable
#   payload, a missing python3, an unreadable register or transcript: the turn
#   ends and the operator is TOLD this check did not run. A Stop guard that
#   fails closed refuses to let the session end at all. An obligation that could
#   not be checked stays owed.
#
# A TEAMMATE IS NEVER REFUSED. A payload carrying agent_id is not the lead.
#
# WHEN IT TAKES EFFECT
#   Hooks snapshot at session start. Installing this changes nothing in the
#   session that installs it; it begins enforcing in the NEXT session.
#
# Exit codes (Claude Code Stop convention):
#   0  nothing owed, owed and paid, not evaluable (announced), stood down
#      (announced), or anything went wrong
#   2  BLOCKED: this turn owes a failure-type answer and (a), (b) or (c) is
#      missing

# --- ROOT RESOLUTION -------------------------------------------------------
# TWO ROOTS, NEVER ONE. The full contract, and why the old single-root
# resolution was wrong the moment the engine became loadable by reference,
# is in scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. This bootstrap block is byte-identical
# in every hook that needs a root; contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R asserts
# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
#
# THE BANNER BELOW GOES OUT ON TWO CHANNELS AND ONLY THE SECOND IS HEARD.
# Measured on Claude Code 2.1.270 (macOS, 2026-09-14) by registering one probe
# hook per channel on five events at once and reading the transcript back:
#
#   channel, exit 0     SessionStart  UserPromptSubmit  PreToolUse  PostToolUse  Stop
#   stderr              silent        silent            silent      silent       silent
#   stdout, plain text  model         model             silent      silent       silent
#   {"systemMessage"}   PERSON        PERSON            PERSON      PERSON       PERSON
#   additionalContext   model         model             model       model        model
#
# `silent` is not shorthand: the host records a `hook_success` attachment
# carrying the text in its stderr field and renders it to NO ONE. So a hook
# that could not find its own engine announced a dead enforcement layer
# exactly as loudly as a clean pass. Of the 60 files carrying this block, 35
# exit 2 here — where the host does render stderr, as the refusal reason — and
# 24 exit 0 and were inaudible. The 24 are the notices and observers, which is
# the trap: the hooks that must never block are the hooks nobody could hear.
#
# WHY `systemMessage` AND NOT `additionalContext`. additionalContext must name
# its own event in the envelope, and this block is identical in hooks
# registered on eight different events — it cannot know which one it is on.
# `systemMessage` is event-agnostic and it reaches the operator rather than
# only the model, which is the right audience for "your guards are off".
# Measured too: adding it to an exit-2 hook leaves the refusal untouched —
# same `hook error:` tool result, same blocked write — and only adds a render.
# Nothing here changes what any hook detects, refuses, or exits with.
#
# The escaping is deliberately pure bash (verified on 3.2.57, the macOS system
# shell) and calls nothing external: this is the one code path in the engine
# that runs when the install is already known to be broken, so it must not
# depend on python3, jq, or any file it has just failed to find.
