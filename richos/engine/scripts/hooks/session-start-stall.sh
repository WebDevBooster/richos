# session-start-stall.sh: SessionStart notice: the stall watcher runs with this
#                         session, what it reports, and the one-line check.
#
# The CEO, 2026-09-28: "WHERE THE FUCK WAS THAT FUCKING WATCHER BEFORE???"
# The watcher itself is the engine's plugin monitor `stall-watch`
# (monitors/monitors.json), which Claude Code starts with every interactive
# session; this notice tells the lead it is there, that it only reports, and
# how to check it (stall-watch.sh --alive) and start the fallback if not.
#
# WHO HEARS IT: the lead only (additionalContext), never the CEO
# (systemMessage), as session-start-quota.sh.
#
# SILENT where the engine was never adopted (no orchestration.config).
# NEVER BLOCKS AND NEVER FAILS THE SESSION: every path exits 0, and stdin is
# never read (session-start-stdin.test.sh, case 9q: a SessionStart hook that
# reads a stdin the host may never close hangs the session start).
