# owned-state.mutation.sh — EVERY PROPERTY OF "ADDRESSED MEANS SMALLER",
# PROVEN BY REMOVING IT.
#
# owned-state.test.sh section 7 is a set of green cases, and green cases are
# evidence of nothing until each has been watched going red for the RIGHT
# reason. This harness takes the shipped gate, removes one property at a time in
# a throwaway copy of the engine, and asserts that the suite fails AT THE NAMED
# CASE.
#
# THE FIRST MUTANT IS THE INCIDENT. On 2026-09-25 the founder asked whether the
# escalation backlog (143 outstanding, the oldest 19 days, 13 for him) had been
# "purely just discovered by accident". It had not: it was printed at every
# session start for a week, behind a gate that a keyword in any prompt
# satisfied. `keyword-counts-again` puts that keyword pattern back, and 7a must
# go red. If it does not, the suite cannot tell the fix from the defect.
#
# Invoked from owned-state.test.sh, so the runner that discovers *.test.sh runs
# this too. A harness nobody runs proves nothing about anything.

# THE DECLARATION IS PART OF WHAT IS UNDER TEST. Section 7 copies the SHIPPED
# `escalations` row out of the engine's own owned-systems.declaration, and the
# shared copier carries scripts/, hooks/ and the config but no root-level
# declaration. Without this the suite would fail at "7-" in every mutant, and a
# red run for that reason would be credited to the mutation. The harness checks
# the NAMED case, so that would be caught, but the copy is what makes the
# mutants mean anything.

    "a dispatch that merely talks about escalations would clear the gate for the whole session, which is the exact hole the 143-item backlog grew behind: the escalations row was 'addressed' once in fifteen days, by an unrelated dispatch whose text contained the word."

# --- 2. A REAL DROP COUNTS -------------------------------------------------
mutant drop-not-credited "7c" "$L" \
    'and rec["measure"] < base:' \
    'and rec["measure"] < base - 1000000:' \
    "acknowledging escalations would never clear the gate, so the one piece of real work it asks for would be answered with a waiver every session, and a gate answered with waivers is a gate that dies."

    'pattern = d.get("triage") or ""' \
    'pattern = ""' \
