# failure-type-lookup.sh — WHEN HE PUTS "TYPE" AND "FAILURE" TOGETHER, THE
#                          FAILURE REGISTER IS IN FRONT OF THE LEAD BEFORE IT
#                          WRITES A WORD.
#
# Registered UserPromptSubmit. Its partner is guard-failure-type-answer.sh on
# Stop, which refuses the turn end until the register was read, a type from it
# was named by number with its heading, and the record was committed. The
# predicates, the measurement and the honest list of what neither hook can
# guarantee are in scripts/lib/failure-type.py; read that first. This file is
# the wiring and the channel.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THIS IS FOR
# ===========================================================================
# 2026-09-26. The operator asked what type of failure something was, and was
# answered from recall. It had happened before: that morning he had to ask the
# same question three times, and the lead promised that a question about a type
# of failure would be answered from the register on the first reply. Nothing
# held the promise but attention, and it broke six hours later. His question
# after that was what exactly must ALWAYS happen when he mentions those two
# words close together, and when it would happen with guaranteed reliability.
# In the register this is Type 61, the lookup that takes seconds answered from
# memory instead, recorded again at section 5.2.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT IT DOES
# ===========================================================================
# On a message of HIS whose words include an inflection of "type" and of
# "failure" within six words of each other:
#   * the MODEL gets the rule, the register's path, both next free numbers from
#     the register's box (and any disagreement between the box and the
#     headings), and every `Type <N>: <heading>` line, READ FROM THE FILE ON
#     THIS MESSAGE, never from a copy;
#   * the PERSON gets one line saying the lookup ran and how many types went in;
#   * an obligation is written to the entity's state, which the Stop gate
#     honors even if it cannot find the message in the transcript.
# On every other message it prints nothing.
#
# IT REFUSES NOTHING. Every path exits 0. The refusal lives at Stop, where the
# lead's actions can be read; this hook only makes sure the answer never has
# to come from memory.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE CHANNEL
# ===========================================================================
# additionalContext reaches the model at UserPromptSubmit and systemMessage
# reaches the person; the measurement is in the table below and in
# left-off-report.sh. The host keeps a hook's additionalContext inline up to
# 10,000 characters (read from the 2.1.283 binary: `CLo=1e4`) and over that
# puts only its head and a file path in front of the model; an older
# measurement recorded in commit-ceo-inputs.sh says 8000 and a dropped object.
# So the analyzer budgets the list under 10,000 and NAMES any type it could not
# fit, rather than letting the host cut it where nobody can see.
#
# Stand down with CHECK_FAILURE_TYPE=0 in orchestration.config: announced when
# his message carries the words, never silent.
#
# Exit codes: always 0.

# --- ROOT RESOLUTION -------------------------------------------------------
# TWO ROOTS, NEVER ONE. The full contract, and why the old single-root
# resolution was wrong the moment the engine became loadable by reference,
# is in scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. This bootstrap block is byte-identical
# in every hook that needs a root; contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R asserts
# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
#
# THE BANNER BELOW GOES OUT ON TWO CHANNELS AND ONLY THE SECOND IS HEARD.
# Measured on Claude Code 2.1.270 (macOS, 2026-09-14) by registering one probe
# hook per channel on five events at once and reading the transcript back:
#
#   channel, exit 0     SessionStart  UserPromptSubmit  PreToolUse  PostToolUse  Stop
#   stderr              silent        silent            silent      silent       silent
#   stdout, plain text  model         model             silent      silent       silent
#   {"systemMessage"}   PERSON        PERSON            PERSON      PERSON       PERSON
#   additionalContext   model         model             model       model        model
#
# `silent` is not shorthand: the host records a `hook_success` attachment
# carrying the text in its stderr field and renders it to NO ONE. So a hook
# that could not find its own engine announced a dead enforcement layer
# exactly as loudly as a clean pass. Of the 60 files carrying this block, 35
# exit 2 here — where the host does render stderr, as the refusal reason — and
# 24 exit 0 and were inaudible. The 24 are the notices and observers, which is
# the trap: the hooks that must never block are the hooks nobody could hear.
#
# WHY `systemMessage` AND NOT `additionalContext`. additionalContext must name
# its own event in the envelope, and this block is identical in hooks
# registered on eight different events — it cannot know which one it is on.
# `systemMessage` is event-agnostic and it reaches the operator rather than
# only the model, which is the right audience for "your guards are off".
# Measured too: adding it to an exit-2 hook leaves the refusal untouched —
# same `hook error:` tool result, same blocked write — and only adds a render.
# Nothing here changes what any hook detects, refuses, or exits with.
#
# The escaping is deliberately pure bash (verified on 3.2.57, the macOS system
# shell) and calls nothing external: this is the one code path in the engine
# that runs when the install is already known to be broken, so it must not
# depend on python3, jq, or any file it has just failed to find.
