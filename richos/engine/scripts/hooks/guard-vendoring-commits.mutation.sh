# guard-vendoring-commits.mutation.sh — PROVES THE VENDORING SUITE CAN FAIL.
#
# Fifty-nine green ticks are evidence of nothing until somebody has watched
# them turn red for the right reason, and this project has been burned by
# exactly that: a secrets scanner whose canary passed green while the scanner
# itself never ran. This guard has the same shape of hiding place. A registry
# lookup that quietly matches everything, an `exit 2` that became `exit 0`, a
# command classifier that stops recognizing `git commit` — every one of those
# leaves the hook wired, registered, executable and PASSING, over zero
# enforcement.
#
# So: take the SHIPPED source, remove ONE property at a time in a throwaway
# copy of the engine, and assert that the suite fails AT THE NAMED CASE.
#
# The harness is scripts/lib/mutation-harness.sh — one loop, shared, because
# seven private copies of it is the defect this engine keeps finding in itself.
#
# Run directly, or let guard-vendoring-commits.test.sh run it (which it does,
# because a harness nobody runs proves nothing about anything).

    '    echo "(hook: scripts/hooks/guard-vendoring-commits.sh)"{NL}} >&2{NL}exit 0' \
    "the guard would find every unrecorded vendoring, print it in full, and let the commit through — a warning wearing a guard's clothes, which is the 2026-08-30 sweep's failure mode exactly."

# --- 2. THE REGISTRY IS WHAT DECIDES ---------------------------------------
mutant everything-looks-recorded "A1. " "$L" \
    '    [ -n "$best" ] || return 1' \
    '    [ -n "$best" ] || return 0' \
    "vm_covering would report every path as already recorded, so the guard would run, look, and find nothing, forever."

mutant nothing-is-governed "A1. " "$L" \
    '        if [ "$rel" = "$pre" ] || [ "${rel#"$pre"/}" != "$rel" ]; then' \
    '        if false; then' \
    "no path would be governed, so no addition would ever be checked — the exact state this repository was in until 2026-09-04."

# --- 3. THE COMMAND CLASSIFIER ---------------------------------------------
# THE HEADLINE MUTANT. Its `new` text is the classifier this guard's sibling
# guard-row-currency-commits.sh carries today, and restoring it here is not a
# hypothetical regression: it is the bug this guard was found to have on its
# first smoke run, where three negative cases returned 0 because a multi-line
# commit message was cut at the blank line and no `git commit` was recognized
# at all.
mutant naive-segment-split "A7. " "$G" \
    'segments = top_level_segments(cmd)' \
    'segments = re.split(r"(?:\\|\\||&&|[;\\n|])", cmd)' \
    "a multi-line commit message — the house style — would be cut mid-quote, both halves would fail to parse, and EVERY such commit would pass unexamined."

    '    if sub != "no-such-verb":{NL}        continue' \
    "no git subcommand would ever match, so the guard would classify every command as PASS and never run its check."

# --- 4. THE ESCAPE HATCH MUST CARRY A REASON -------------------------------
# WHY THIS MUTANT IS COARSE, AND WHY THAT IS THE FINDING RATHER THAN A
# SHORTCUT. The first attempt removed only the extraction pattern's
# "at least one non-blank character" requirement, and the suite stayed GREEN —
# correctly. A bare marker is caught THREE times over: by the pattern, by the
# `if not r` branch, and by the 30-character floor. That redundancy is a good
# property, and a mutant that does not know about it reports a false negative
# dressed as a finding. So this one removes the whole validation instead, which
# is the property the case actually names: a marker's REASON is judged at all.
mutant reason-never-validated "A8. " "$G" \
    'ACK_WHY="$(_vendoring_reason_problem "$ACK_REASON" 2>/dev/null || printf '"'"'the justification could not be evaluated.'"'"')"' \
    'ACK_WHY=""' \
    "any 'vendoring-ack:' line at all would exempt anything, so the escape hatch becomes an off switch anyone can type."

mutant no-length-floor "A9. " "$G" \
    'MIN_CHARS = 30{NL}MIN_WORDS = 5{NL}MIN_CONTENT = 3' \
    'MIN_CHARS = 0{NL}MIN_WORDS = 0{NL}MIN_CONTENT = 0' \

    '    elif hit:' \
    '    elif False:' \
    "'I will add the entry later' would be accepted as a justification — which is not a reason, it is the behavior the registry replaces, and it is what fourteen skills did for six months."

# --- 5. THE SUBJECT IS ADDITIONS, AGAINST THE RIGHT BASE -------------------
# Aimed at the AMEND BRANCH, not at the HEAD~1 lookup inside it. Removing only
# the lookup leaves BASE empty, which falls through to the empty-tree base —
# every tracked file then reads as added and the unrecorded one is still caught,
# so the suite stays green for an unrelated reason. The property is that an
# amend is recognized AS an amend.

    "an entry for engine/skills/known would silently cover engine/skills/known-extra — a NEW, unrecorded vendoring passing on the strength of a shared prefix."
