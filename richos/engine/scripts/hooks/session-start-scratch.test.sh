# session-start-scratch.test.sh — THE NOTICE MUST BE SILENT, AUDIBLE, AND
#                                 HARMLESS, IN THAT ORDER OF DIFFICULTY.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
# ===========================================================================
# A SessionStart notice has three ways to fail and only one of them is loud:
#
#   1. IT SPEAKS WHEN THERE IS NOTHING TO SAY. Every banner this engine ships
#      competes for the same two seconds of attention, and the one that talks
#      on a healthy machine is the one that trains people to skip all of them.
#   2. IT SPEAKS WHERE NOBODY HEARS. Measured 2026-09-14 across this engine's
#      hooks: stderr at SessionStart renders to NO channel, and the CI notice
#      spent its life writing a live finding to it
#      (docs/verification/check-census-2026-09-14.md). This one carries its
#      text on systemMessage AND additionalContext, and the suite checks both
#      rather than checking that "something was printed".
#   3. IT BREAKS THE SESSION. A hook that exits non-zero, or that hangs on a
#      slow disk, costs every session start on the machine.
#
#   N1  a healthy machine gets SILENCE and exit 0.
#   N2  more than the declared threshold reclaimable -> it says so, on BOTH
#       channels, and still exits 0.
#   N3  the scheduled job NOT INSTALLED -> it says so. This is the
#       who-watches-the-watchman leg: a deleter that was never scheduled looks
#       exactly like a machine with no garbage on it.
#   N4  the job installed but with NO record of a pass -> it says so.
#   N5  the job installed and its last pass long ago -> it says so, with the
#       age.
#   N6  a BROKEN reaper (deleted, or refusing) is silent about sizes and still
#       exits 0. A notice that takes the session down with it is worse than no
#       notice.
#   N7  STOOD DOWN by declaration -> completely silent.
#   N8  nothing is ever written to stderr.
#
# Exit 0 = every case passed; exit 1 = at least one failed.
