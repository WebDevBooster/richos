# notice-unanswered-question.sh — Stop hook. NEVER blocks.
#
# A QUESTION TO THE CEO THAT HAS NOT BEEN ANSWERED STAYS IN FRONT OF HIM.
#
# guard-ceo-ruled-ask.sh's deaf-lead check (2026-10-01) refuses an
# AskUserQuestion while a teammate of this session is live: that tool held the
# lead's turn open for 37 minutes and everything that could have woken it
# queued behind it. The question goes as the turn's FINAL MESSAGE instead,
# under the fixed lead-in `QUESTION FOR YOU:`. That route has one cost the tool
# did not: every later turn the lead is woken for (a teammate finishing, the
# stall watcher) prints below the question, and he comes back to the newest
# notification, not to the question (Sage's review, richos-hq 8ba32b71, item 9).
#
# So while a `QUESTION FOR YOU:` final message from an earlier turn has no later
# human prompt, this repeats it in the Stop systemMessage at every turn end.
# That channel is shown to the PERSON and never to the model (measured: the
# table below, and escalations.py's DELIVERY section), so it re-surfaces the
# question without waking anything and without telling the model anything new.
# Not de-duplicated, deliberately: the point is that it is under every turn.
# Its own turn is skipped (the question is already the last thing on screen),
# and so is a Stop re-fire after a block (stop_hook_active).
#
# The predicate, and why the lead-in is matched mechanically and never by a
# prose classifier: scripts/lib/blocking_ask.py, `unanswered`.

# --- ROOT RESOLUTION -------------------------------------------------------
# TWO ROOTS, NEVER ONE. The full contract, and why the old single-root
# resolution was wrong the moment the engine became loadable by reference,
# is in scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. This bootstrap block is byte-identical
# in every hook that needs a root; contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R asserts
# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
#
# THE BANNER BELOW GOES OUT ON TWO CHANNELS AND ONLY THE SECOND IS HEARD.
# Measured on Claude Code 2.1.270 (macOS, 2026-09-14) by registering one probe
# hook per channel on five events at once and reading the transcript back:
#
#   channel, exit 0     SessionStart  UserPromptSubmit  PreToolUse  PostToolUse  Stop
#   stderr              silent        silent            silent      silent       silent
#   stdout, plain text  model         model             silent      silent       silent
#   {"systemMessage"}   PERSON        PERSON            PERSON      PERSON       PERSON
#   additionalContext   model         model             model       model        model
#
# `silent` is not shorthand: the host records a `hook_success` attachment
# carrying the text in its stderr field and renders it to NO ONE. So a hook
# that could not find its own engine announced a dead enforcement layer
# exactly as loudly as a clean pass. Of the 60 files carrying this block, 35
# exit 2 here — where the host does render stderr, as the refusal reason — and
# 24 exit 0 and were inaudible. The 24 are the notices and observers, which is
# the trap: the hooks that must never block are the hooks nobody could hear.
#
# WHY `systemMessage` AND NOT `additionalContext`. additionalContext must name
# its own event in the envelope, and this block is identical in hooks
# registered on eight different events — it cannot know which one it is on.
# `systemMessage` is event-agnostic and it reaches the operator rather than
# only the model, which is the right audience for "your guards are off".
# Measured too: adding it to an exit-2 hook leaves the refusal untouched —
# same `hook error:` tool result, same blocked write — and only adds a render.
# Nothing here changes what any hook detects, refuses, or exits with.
#
# The escaping is deliberately pure bash (verified on 3.2.57, the macOS system
# shell) and calls nothing external: this is the one code path in the engine
# that runs when the install is already known to be broken, so it must not
# depend on python3, jq, or any file it has just failed to find.
