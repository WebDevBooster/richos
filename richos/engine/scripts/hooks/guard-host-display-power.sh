# ===========================================================================
# THE RULING, AND THE FAILURE IT WAS GIVEN FOR
# ===========================================================================
# ceo-decisions.md §65 (2026-09-19). His words at 19:10Z:
#
#     "So, this is why all of the monitors went black and there was no way for
#      me to switch them back on? I'm lucky that locking the screen with the
#      keyboard button worked and that unlocking brought back the screens on.
#      But a horrible fucking experience that! I was already considering
#      killing the Mac with the power button!"
#
# WHAT HAPPENED, re-derived from the transcripts rather than recalled, because
# the shape of the failure decides this file's surfaces:
#
#   18:38:49Z  Rich SENDS zach-opus-testvm1 a mid-task correction:
#              "the completion proof ... must be captured while the HOST's
#               screen is locked (`pmset displaysleepnow` or the lock shortcut
#               via the CEO — if you cannot lock it yourself without a
#               keystroke, say so and I will ask him to lock it for the test)"
#              and, in the same message, "The VM host process runs under
#              `caffeinate -dimsu` (or equivalent)".
#   18:45:03Z  The teammate CORRECTS the caffeinate half by hand — "-d (prevent
#              DISPLAY sleep) and -u (declare user active) ... would keep the
#              CEO's screen lit and awake permanently" — and ships `-is`.
#   18:51:27Z  It runs `pmset displaysleepnow` as the first line of a capture.
#   18:51:31Z  It runs `pmset displaysleepnow` again, four seconds later.
#   19:10Z     The CEO, at the machine, asks the question above.
#
# TWO EXECUTIONS, not three. §65's own account says "at least three times" and
# the brief that ordered this file says "7 mentions ... at least 3 executions";
# the transcript holds exactly two Bash tool calls carrying that command
# (agent-acb0a69e78f52de0b.jsonl, lines 499 and 503). The seven were JSONL
# lines, which count tool results and echoes. The correction is recorded here
# because a number in the record is a claim with a date on it, and nothing in
# this guard's design rests on which of two and three it was.
#
# THE SURFACE THE INCIDENT ACTUALLY USED WAS `SendMessage`, AND THAT IS WHY
# THERE ARE FOUR OF THEM. zach-opus-testvm1's spawn prompt does not contain the
# word pmset, or sleep, or lock, or display — checked, all 5,845 characters of
# it. The command reached the teammate through the mailbox. A guard wired only
# on Bash, Agent and Write — which is what this file was commissioned as —
# would not have seen the instruction at all; it would have caught only the
# teammate's own Bash call, which is the last line of defense and not the
# first. §65's rule text names the vector in as many words: "no brief, MESSAGE
# or script Rich writes". So SendMessage is a surface here.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT IT REFUSES — ENUMERATED FROM THE MAN PAGES ON THIS MACHINE
# ===========================================================================
# Not from memory, and the difference showed up twice.
#
#   pmset(1)      ANY invocation whose first argument is not `-g`. The synopsis
#                 is `pmset [-a|-b|-c|-u] [setting value]`, `pmset -g [option]`,
#                 `pmset schedule ...`, `pmset repeat ...`, `pmset relative ...`,
#                 `pmset [touch | sleepnow | displaysleepnow | boot]`. EVERY
#                 form except `-g` writes: the four source flags set timers,
#                 `schedule`/`repeat`/`relative` arm power events, and the bare
#                 verbs act immediately. `relative` is in the synopsis and in
#                 none of the lists this guard was commissioned with — it
#                 schedules a wake or a poweron, and the man page says the
#                 event "cannot be canceled". So the rule is stated as the man
#                 page states it: `-g` reads, everything else does not. `pmset`
#                 with no arguments prints usage and is allowed.
#
#   caffeinate(8) `-u` and `-d`, and ONLY those two.
#                   -u  "If the display is off, this option turns the display
#                        ON and prevents the display from going into idle
#                        sleep." That is a display state change, full stop.
#                   -d  "prevent the display from sleeping" — it cannot black a
#                        screen out, and refusing it therefore does not follow
#                        from the incident. It follows from the OTHER half of
#                        the same message: held with no utility it persists
#                        until caffeinate exits, which for a backgrounded agent
#                        is forever, and the CEO's display-sleep setting stops
#                        working on his own machine. The teammate reached that
#                        conclusion by hand at 18:45:03Z and swapped `-dimsu`
#                        for `-is`. This encodes what it worked out.
#                   -i -m -s -t -w  ALLOWED, with or without a utility. None of
#                        them touches the display; `caffeinate -is <cmd>` is the
#                        shipped form and stays shipped. A guard that made the
#                        safe alternative harder would be waived by lunchtime.
#
#   osascript(1)  a script text that tells the host to sleep, shut down,
#                 restart, log out, lock the screen, start the screen saver, or
#                 that sends a MODIFIER KEYSTROKE — `keystroke`/`key code` with
#                 a `using ... down` clause.
#
#   killall/pkill of loginwindow, WindowServer, Dock, Finder, SystemUIServer,
#                 ScreenSaverEngine, Terminal, iTerm2. NOTE `SystemUIServer` —
#                 the commissioning list spelled it `SystemUIService`, which is
#                 not a process on this machine; both spellings are matched and
#                 only one of them exists.
#
#   `kill` IS NEVER A TRIGGER, and that is a design decision rather than an
#                 omission. `kill -TERM <pid>` is the PRESCRIBED way to quit a
#                 test instance (see the Command-Q paragraph below). A guard
#                 that caught the remedy along with the defect teaches its
#                 reader to route around it.
#
#   shutdown, reboot, halt          always.
#   launchctl reboot | bootout gui/…  always.
#   defaults write|delete com.apple.{screensaver,loginwindow,PowerManagement,dock}
#   nvram <name>=<value> | -d | -c  (`nvram -p` and a bare read are allowed).
#   systemsetup -set{displaysleep,computersleep,harddisksleep,sleep,restart…,
#                 wakeonnetworkaccess,allowpowerbutton…}  (`-get…` allowed).
#   open -a ScreenSaverEngine, or executing any path naming ScreenSaverEngine.
#   displayplacer, brightness, betterdisplaycli, CGSession -suspend.
#
# NOT INSTALLED ON THIS MACHINE, stated rather than implied: `displayplacer`,
# `brightness`, and the `CGSession` binary under Menu Extras — checked with
# `command -v` and `ls`. They are matched anyway because they are one `brew
# install` away and the pattern costs nothing, and because a guard that only
# knows the binaries that happen to be present today is a guard with a shelf
# life. No test can execute them, so no test pretends to.
#
# THE COMMAND-Q CASE, AND THE 42 COMMANDS IT MAKES RED
# ----------------------------------------------------
# The same day, an agent's `osascript … keystroke "q" using command down` went
# to the CEO's Terminal — it had been addressed at a specific unix id, and
# System Events delivers to whatever is FRONTMOST, so when the target had
# already exited the key landed on him and offered to terminate the session.
#
# MEASURED, because this is the one pattern with a real incumbent population:
# 42 Bash calls across this project's transcripts send a modifier keystroke
# through System Events, and every one of them is an agent quitting its own
# on-screen test instance — the procedure §54 addendum 4 requires. They are not
# collateral damage; they are the practice §65 ends. The refusal below
# therefore CARRIES THE REPLACEMENT rather than pointing at a rule: quit by pid
# with `kill -TERM`, confirm with `pgrep`. A guard that only says no to the
# only method somebody knows gets waived, and habitual waiving is how a guard
# dies.
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE
# -----------------------------
#   * An UNMODIFIED `keystroke`/`key code`. `key code 53` (Escape) addressed at
#     a frontmost app is the walk idiom and is not a session-state change; §65
#     says "no keystroke with a MODIFIER to the host" and this matches that.
#   * `osascript -` / `osascript <<EOF` reading a script from STDIN. The script
#     text is not in the payload and this guard will not pretend to have read
#     it. testvm/ax.sh uses exactly that form, deliberately, and is exempt for
#     a better reason (below).
#   * Volume, wallpaper, notification state. Real annoyances; not display,
#     sleep, lock, session or input, which is what §65 names.
#   * `xargs`, `find -exec`, `watch`, and every other indirect executor except
#     `sh|bash|zsh|dash|ksh -c`, which IS followed. Named so the gap is a known
#     one rather than a discovered one.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE GUEST EXEMPTION IS STRUCTURAL, NOT TEXTUAL
# ===========================================================================
# §65 permits these state changes "only inside a test VM over ssh", so the
# exemption has to be real — and "the string appears after an `ssh`" is not it.
# `ssh vm 'true'; pmset displaysleepnow` satisfies that test and blacks out the
# CEO's screen.
#
# So the command is TOKENIZED instead. The text is split into shell segments at
# unquoted `;  && || | & newline ( ) { }`, command substitutions are pulled out
# and analyzed as segments of their own, and each segment is resolved to its
# COMMAND WORD after stripping `VAR=value` assignments and the wrappers `sudo
# doas env nohup time nice stdbuf setsid command builtin exec`. A segment is
# guest-bound when THAT WORD is `ssh`/`scp`/`sftp`, or a script under a
# `testvm/` path segment. Everything the segment carries after that runs on the
# far side of the connection, and nothing before it does — because there is
# nothing before it, the command word is the first word.
#
# TWO CONSEQUENCES WORTH STATING:
#
#   * `testvm/ax.sh <vm> …` is exempt BY CONSTRUCTION, verified by reading it
#     rather than by trusting its name: every path that reaches a SCREEN ends at
#     `guest_ssh`, which is `ssh "${TESTVM_SSH_OPTS[@]}" … "$user@$ip"`
#     (lib.sh) — the AppleScript form at `osascript -`, and the `tree`/`find`/
#     `click` forms at `osascript -l JavaScript -`.
#     CORRECTED 2026-09-20, when those three subcommands were added: it is no
#     longer true that ax.sh runs NOTHING locally. They build their parameter
#     block and render the guest's answer with `python3 -c` on this Mac, and
#     take one `mktemp` scratch file. None of that touches display, power,
#     session or input, so the exemption still holds — but it holds because the
#     local branches are pure text, not because there are none. If a local
#     branch in there ever grows teeth, this is the sentence that changes with
#     it.
#   * `ssh -o ProxyCommand='…'` and `-o LocalCommand='…'` DO run locally, so an
#     ssh segment is still scanned for those two option values and they are
#     analyzed as commands. Without this, the word `ssh` would be a bypass with
#     an option flag on it.
#
# The suite's negative controls are the wrapped forms: a host command after an
# ssh segment, a host command inside `bash -c`, a host command behind an
# `ssh`-shaped environment assignment, and a ProxyCommand. All refused.
#
# ===========================================================================
# PROSE: THE RECORD OF THE RULE MUST BE WRITEABLE
# ===========================================================================
# On Agent, SendMessage and Write|Edit the payload is text, not a command, and
# the failure mode to avoid is the one that cost this engine fourteen lines in
# two vendored skills on 2026-08-30: a guard that forbids the record of what it
# forbids. §65 itself quotes `pmset displaysleepnow`, `caffeinate -d`/`-u` and
# `killall loginwindow`, and it MUST be writeable.
#
#   (a) A CANDIDATE COMMAND is every occurrence of a trigger word, taken to the
#       end of its line or to the closing backtick, and then judged by the same
#       shell rules the Bash surface uses. So "no `pmset` other than `pmset -g`"
#       yields two candidates and neither is refused, while "`pmset
#       displaysleepnow` or the lock shortcut" yields one that is.
#
#       IN PROSE, `shutdown reboot halt restart defaults open brightness` are
#       triggers ONLY INSIDE A CODE SPAN OR FENCE. They are ordinary English
#       and this record is full of them — "shutdown_request", "teammate
#       shutdown", "the defaults", "open the file". The other triggers (pmset,
#       caffeinate, osascript, killall, pkill, launchctl, nvram, systemsetup,
#       displayplacer, CGSession, ScreenSaverEngine) are not words anybody
#       writes by accident and fire anywhere.
#
#   (b) SCOPE IS THE BLOCK in prose and THE LINE in code, for the reason the
#       sibling guard measured: hard-wrapping is a formatting choice and must
#       not change a verdict, while joining adjacent SOURCE lines lets one
#       line's comment exempt the next line's command. A fenced code block is
#       one unit, and the paragraph immediately above it contributes its cues —
#       "the guard refuses:" followed by a fence is how every such passage in
#       this record is actually written.
#
#   (c) A BLOCK THAT IS RECORDING RATHER THAN INSTRUCTING PASSES. The cue list
#       is the negation/refusal vocabulary: never, no, not, n't, nothing, none,
#       refuses, banned, forbidden, blocked, prevented, impossible, instead,
#       zero, went black, and the words beside them.
#
#   (d) AND A PERMISSIVE CONSTRUCTION VETOES (c). This is not decoration; it is
#       the half that makes the difference on the two real texts:
#
#         echo-brief-wait-for-screen-unlock-2026-09-18.md, line 47 —
#           "(YOU MAY lock the screen with `pmset displaysleepnow` only when
#            Rich says the screen is free — ask first...)"
#         the block it sits in also says "only if NO candidate is on screen",
#         about something else entirely. Cue-only, it exempts itself.
#
#         the 18:38:49Z SendMessage —
#           "...(`pmset displaysleepnow` or the lock shortcut via the CEO — IF
#            YOU CANNOT lock it yourself without a keystroke, say so...)"
#         "cannot" and "without" are both cues, in a sentence handing over the
#         command. Cue-only, it exempts itself too.
#
#       So `you may|can|could|should`, `feel free`, `go ahead`, `it is fine/ok/
#       safe`, `if you can|cannot`, `or equivalent`, `runs under`, and `use|run|
#       using|with <trigger>` cancel the exemption. Every entry on that list was
#       taken from a sentence that exists, and the two above are in the suite.
#
# NOTE what (d) means for the 2026-09-18 brief: it is REFUSED, and it was
# correct when it was written — §65 was ruled on the 19th. The rule is right
# and the document predates it, which is the same thing its sibling found and
# the same reason to say it out loud rather than quietly re-date the finding.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE ESCAPE HATCH IS A QUOTATION, NOT A MARKER
# ===========================================================================
#     ceo-ruled-host-power: §<N> — "<his verbatim sentence>"
#
# on its own line. It needs a section token, a quoted sentence of at least 25
# characters, AND THE SECTION MUST EXIST in the CEO's record — the guard opens
# wiki/ceo-decisions.md through cr_resolve(), the engine's single declaration
# of where his rulings live. A bare marker exempts nothing. Where the record
# cannot be reached at all the citation is accepted on its shape and logged
# UNVERIFIED: "I cannot check" is never "forbidden".
#
# Accepted uses append to <entity root>/.claude/state/host-power-acks.log,
# beside the other opt-out ledgers, so a habit of waiving is visible.
#
# WHY A QUOTATION HERE TOO. The instruction that caused this was not careless —
# it was careful, hedged, and conditional ("only when Rich says the screen is
# free", "if you cannot lock it yourself, say so"). A free-text reason field
# would have been filled in exactly that well. A citation that must resolve
# against the file cannot be.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE SELF-EXEMPTION, DECLARED RATHER THAN HIDDEN
# ===========================================================================
# This file, its suite, its mutation harness and its corpus are exempt BY
# BASENAME — four names, checked against the basename and never a directory,
# listed here rather than in a config key so that adding to it is an edit
# somebody reviews. Without it this guard could not be authored, tested or
# repaired, and a guard that cannot be repaired is one somebody deletes.
#
# ceo-decisions.md IS NOT ON THAT LIST, deliberately. §65 passes on MERIT, and
# the suite proves it by driving §65 through this guard.
#
# ===========================================================================
# FAIL OPEN, AND LOUDLY
# ===========================================================================
#   NOT ADOPTED (no orchestration.config)     -> STAND DOWN, silent.
#   HOST_DISPLAY_POWER_GUARD="off"            -> STAND DOWN, silent.
#   NO TRIGGER WORD ANYWHERE                  -> SILENT, and this is the large
#     majority of the 1,097 Bash calls measured beside this file.
#   PAYLOAD UNPARSEABLE, python3 MISSING      -> ALLOW + ANNOUNCE. This guard
#     can read neither the command nor the hatch from such a call.
#   THE CEO RECORD UNREADABLE                 -> the hatch is accepted on its
#     shape and logged UNVERIFIED. It never turns a pass into a refusal.
#
# The one thing that is NOT fail-open: scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh missing.
#
# ===========================================================================
# MEASURED, ON REAL TEXT, BEFORE IT WAS WIRED
# ===========================================================================
# 1,632 real payloads, driven through THIS FILE as Bash and Write calls — so
# the measurement is of the shipped rule and not of a model of it. The full
# listing, with the reason each finding is right, is in
# host-display-power.corpus.md beside this file.
#
#   1,097 Bash commands  — every `Bash` tool call in the session that ordered
#                          this guard.  19 REFUSED, 1,078 silent.
#     10  `caffeinate -dimsu python3 scripts/nightly-local.py build …` — the
#         nightly candidate build, twenty minutes at a time, holding `-u` (turn
#         the display ON, declare the user active) on the CEO's own Mac. Right,
#         and the highest-value catch in the whole measurement: nothing
#         anywhere was watching for it, and `-is` does the job.
#      9  `osascript … keystroke "q" using command down` — the Command-Q quit,
#         including three of Rich's own. Right; §65 bans it by name.
#      0  anything else.
#
#     535 documents — all 248 committed briefs, the whole of ceo-decisions.md,
#                     CLAUDE.md, and every memory note.  2 REFUSED.
#         echo-brief-wait-for-screen-unlock-2026-09-18.md:47 — "you may lock
#         the screen with `pmset displaysleepnow`", the sentence that put the
#         command in a teammate's hands. Written the day BEFORE §65: the rule
#         is right and the document predates it.
#         zach-brief-candidate-build-time-2026-09-19.md:5 — `caffeinate -dimsu`
#         in a brief. Right.
#         NOTHING ELSE. §65 itself passes, on merit, with no path exemption.
#
# THE ONE MISS, STATED RATHER THAN DISCOVERED LATER. In
# echo-brief-front-door-suite-in-the-build-2026-09-18.md two blocks carry
# `caffeinate -dimsu` as an instruction and are EXEMPTED, because each block
# also quotes a test runner — "REFUSED: --bundle must name a…", "the runner
# must refuse". The cue test cannot tell a refusal ABOUT this command from a
# refusal about something else, and the fix is not available: `refus…` is the
# central verb of this record, and dropping it would refuse §65 itself.
#
# THAT MISS IS AFFORDABLE, AND SAYING WHY IS THE DESIGN. The prose layer is
# DEFENSE IN DEPTH and is tuned toward permissiveness on purpose — its failure
# mode is forbidding the record, which is unrecoverable. The SHELL layer is the
# airtight one: it applies no cue test to a real command, and it refused that
# same brief's `caffeinate -dimsu` four separate times when somebody ran it.
#
# MEASURED AND NOT LOAD-BEARING: removing `\bfail(?:s|ed|ure)?\b` from the cue
# list changes NO verdict on any of the 1,632 payloads. It is kept as
# vocabulary, not as a proven property, and it is named here so a later reader
# does not mistake it for one.
#
# NOTE: hooks are snapshotted at session start. This one is INERT until the
# next session — it assumes nothing about being live in the session that adds
# it, which is the session that wrote the brief it refuses.

set -eo pipefail
# --- ROOT RESOLUTION -------------------------------------------------------
# TWO ROOTS, NEVER ONE. The full contract, and why the old single-root
# resolution was wrong the moment the engine became loadable by reference,
# is in scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. This bootstrap block is byte-identical
# in every hook that needs a root; contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R asserts
# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
#
# THE BANNER BELOW GOES OUT ON TWO CHANNELS AND ONLY THE SECOND IS HEARD.
# Measured on Claude Code 2.1.270 (macOS, 2026-09-14) by registering one probe
# hook per channel on five events at once and reading the transcript back:
#
#   channel, exit 0     SessionStart  UserPromptSubmit  PreToolUse  PostToolUse  Stop
#   stderr              silent        silent            silent      silent       silent
#   stdout, plain text  model         model             silent      silent       silent
#   {"systemMessage"}   PERSON        PERSON            PERSON      PERSON       PERSON
#   additionalContext   model         model             model       model        model
#
# `silent` is not shorthand: the host records a `hook_success` attachment
# carrying the text in its stderr field and renders it to NO ONE. So a hook
# that could not find its own engine announced a dead enforcement layer
# exactly as loudly as a clean pass. Of the 60 files carrying this block, 35
# exit 2 here — where the host does render stderr, as the refusal reason — and
# 24 exit 0 and were inaudible. The 24 are the notices and observers, which is
# the trap: the hooks that must never block are the hooks nobody could hear.
#
# WHY `systemMessage` AND NOT `additionalContext`. additionalContext must name
# its own event in the envelope, and this block is identical in hooks
# registered on eight different events — it cannot know which one it is on.
# `systemMessage` is event-agnostic and it reaches the operator rather than
# only the model, which is the right audience for "your guards are off".
# Measured too: adding it to an exit-2 hook leaves the refusal untouched —
# same `hook error:` tool result, same blocked write — and only adds a render.
# Nothing here changes what any hook detects, refuses, or exits with.
#
# The escaping is deliberately pure bash (verified on 3.2.57, the macOS system
# shell) and calls nothing external: this is the one code path in the engine

def candidates(line, in_code):
    """Candidate command strings out of one line.

    THE TWO SURFACES ASK DIFFERENT QUESTIONS AND THE SPLIT IS THE DESIGN.

    CODE is already a command. The whole line goes to the shell analyzer, which
    requires the dangerous binary to be in COMMAND POSITION — the same test the
    Bash surface applies, for the same reason. So a comment is not a command
    (`strip_comments` eats `#`, and `// handy: pmset …` resolves to the command
    word `//`), and a MENTION is not an invocation: `brew install tesseract
    displayplacer` has the command word `brew`.

    WHY THAT MATTERS, measured rather than argued: with a word-scan here — take
    every trigger word to end of line and judge that — the newly landed
    `testvm/provision-guest.sh` was refused for the `displayplacer` in its
    `brew install` line. An engineer editing that file would have been blocked
    on every save, which is how a guard gets switched off.

    A NAMED GAP, so it is a known one: command position cannot see a host
    command embedded in a non-shell source as data — `Command::new("pmset")
    .arg("displaysleepnow")` in Rust resolves to no command word this
    understands. The word-scan did not catch it either (it produced
    `pmset").arg("displaysleepnow")`, whose basename is not `pmset`), so
    nothing was lost here; it is simply not covered, and the Bash surface
    catches the process when it actually runs.

    PROSE has no command position. "run pmset displaysleepnow" is the shape, so
    every trigger word starts a candidate that runs to the end of the line or
    the closing backtick.
