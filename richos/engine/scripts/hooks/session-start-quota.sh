# session-start-quota.sh — SessionStart notice: the CEO's 93% quota rule
#                          applies to this session, and here is the command.
#
# HIS WORDS (ruling §87, richos-hq/wiki/ceo-decisions.md):
#   "quota polling: every 5 minutes from now. And once it crosses the 93%
#    threshold: PAUSE subagents. Then resume after quota rest."
#
# On 2026-09-25 he asked when the rule would be "burned in everywhere where it
# should be" and when there would be "a re-usable script for that". The script
# is scripts/quota-watch.sh. This notice is the burning-in: every lead, in
# every session of a repository that adopted the engine, is told the rule in
# his words, the threshold as declared, the reading now, and the exact command
# that starts the watcher.
#
# WHO HEARS IT: THE LEAD, NOT THE CEO. The text goes out on additionalContext
# only, which reaches the model. It deliberately does NOT use systemMessage,
# which reaches the person: the design notes this rule rests on
# (richos-hq/docs/plans/budget-self-management-2026-09-10.md, R4) put "no
# meter, no percentage, no countdown in his ordinary view". The lead gets the
# number; he does not.
#
# SILENT where the rule cannot apply: a repository that never adopted the
# engine has no orchestration.config, and engine-status.sh already announces
# that stand-down. An adopted repository with no QUOTA_PAUSE_PERCENT is NOT
# silent: the notice says the watcher cannot run and which line to declare.
#
# NEVER BLOCKS AND NEVER FAILS THE SESSION: every path exits 0. It reads one
# small JSON file and one config line; it does not load the workspace registry.
#
# It resolves no entity root itself: quota-watch.sh does, from the session's
# CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR and working directory, like every rooted engine script.
