# guard-brief-scope.sh — BLOCKING PreToolUse guard on the Agent tool.
#
# REFUSES A DISPATCH AGAINST A SPEC-GOVERNED BODY OF WORK WHEN EVERY SPEC POINT
# THE BRIEF NAMES IS ALREADY RECORDED GREEN BY A RUN — AND WHEN THE BRIEF NAMES
# NO SPEC POINT AT ALL.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY A GUARD AND NOT A REVIEWER
# ===========================================================================
# The CEO has already run the reviewer experiment, at his own expense, and
# recorded the result. He supervised every engineer brief himself; then he put
# TWO ADVERSARIAL REVIEWERS on every brief BEFORE every round; his verdict is
# that this is the only reason the job was completed at all. AND IT STILL
# FAILED: by round 7 the work had drifted off his fourteen points, and the thing
# that caught it was him noticing a round 10 was being proposed after being told
# round 7 or 8 would be the last.
#
# The reason is type K of the lifecycle failure record, and it is measured:
# his fourteen points contain ZERO adversarial words, and "every reviewer brief
# Rich wrote instructed them to attack the machinery." THE REVIEWERS WERE
# AUDITING AGAINST A PREMISE THE LEAD HAD ALREADY CORRUPTED. A reader is briefed
# by the lead. Adding readers adds people who are briefed by the lead.
#
# So this guard reads nothing the lead wrote except ONE declaration, and decides
# against two artifacts he did not author: THE CEO'S SPEC and A RUN'S OUTPUT.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT IT REFUSES, AND WHY EACH ONE IS A FACT AND NOT A JUDGMENT
# ===========================================================================
#   NO-ANCHOR         the brief names no point of the spec that governs this
#                     work. Round 9's item 1 (a gutted probe reads GREEN) is in
#                     none of the CEO's fourteen sentences and could not have
#                     been anchored to one.
#   SPEC-SATISFIED    every point it names is recorded GREEN. A round exists to
#                     turn a red point green; this one has no spec-derived
#                     reason to exist. Round 9's own third line says
#                     `14 green, 0 red`.
#   VERDICT-STALE     the measurement predates the branch tip it judges.
#   SPEC-CHANGED      the CEO's page is not the text this work was recorded
#                     against, so nothing derived from it can be trusted.
#   NO-SUCH-POINT     the brief names a point the spec does not have.
#   POINT-UNMEASURED  the brief names a point the run produced no verdict for.
#                     An unmeasured point is not a red one.
#   WRONG-WORK        the brief declares a different body of work than the one
#                     recorded for the repository. Renaming the work is the
#                     clean way out of a spec's reach, so it is refused here and
#                     becomes the CEO's to start.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHO THIS BLOCKS, AND WHAT IT COSTS EVERYONE ELSE
# ===========================================================================
# THE LEAD, on one kind of dispatch: work against a body of work whose spec has
# been RECORDED. Nothing else. A body of work with no recorded spec — which is
# every body of work at the moment this ships — takes the silent exit 0 below
# and pays a `read_json` of a file the spawn path already reads.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE ESCAPE HATCH, AND WHY IT IS THE CEO'S AND NOT THE LEAD'S
# ===========================================================================
#     scope-ceo-word: <what he said, and when>
#
# on its own line in the spawn prompt. The refusal text hands the lead the exact
# question to put to him, because the question is one he demonstrably wants —
# it is the question he asked himself, unprompted, and it is the only thing in
# this whole body of work that ever caught the drift.
#
# THE HONEST RESIDUE, stated here rather than discovered later: NOTHING IN THIS
# HOOK CAN VERIFY THAT HE SPOKE. A lead who writes a sentence he was never told
# gets past it. What the hatch buys is that the evasion has to be a fabricated
# quotation of the CEO, written into a log he can read, rather than a silent
# dispatch that leaves no trace at all. Every use is logged to
# .claude/state/brief-scope-acks.log.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHY PreToolUse[Agent]
# ===========================================================================
# The scope of a dispatch is decided at exactly one moment — the spawn — and
# this is the last event that sees it before an engineer starts building. The
# alternatives were considered and rejected for the reasons the census of
# 2026-09-14 measured: PostToolUse REFUSES NOTHING (verified in this repository,
# notice-claim-capability.sh lines 248-262), so a scope check there is failure
# type AB, a detector with no authority. A Stop-time notice reports a round that
# has already been built. A lint over the brief file is an honor-system check,
# and this engine has retired every one of those.
#
# Exit 2 with the reason on stderr is the only channel the host renders as a
# refusal reason. Exit 0 on anything it cannot evaluate: a guard that fails
# closed on its own inability protects nothing and teaches its reader to skip it.

# A PAYLOAD THIS GUARD NEVER READ IS NOT A DISPATCH IT APPROVED, and the bare

# that is not JSON, as it takes on a spawn it read in full and found in scope —
# which is the absence of a CHECK wearing the costume of the absence of a
# FINDING, the property scripts/lib/unevaluated-notice.sh exists for.
#
# This guard is emphatically NOT payload-independent: every word of its verdict
# comes out of the prompt in that payload, so the `# UNEVALUATED-PAYLOAD-EXEMPT:`
# declaration would be a false claim about this file. It announces instead. The
# exit stays 0 either way — failing closed on its own inability protects nothing,
