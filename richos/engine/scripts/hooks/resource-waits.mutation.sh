# resource-waits.mutation.sh — PROVES THE RESOURCE-WAIT SUITE CAN FAIL, ONE RULE
#                              AT A TIME, FOR THE RIGHT REASON.
#
# Half of what resource-waits.test.sh asserts is silence (a 9-minute waiter, a
# busy holder with nobody waiting, a wait that ended), and a gate that never
# runs is silent too. So: take the shipped source, remove ONE property in a
# throwaway copy of the engine, and assert that the suite fails AT THE CASE
# THAT NAMES IT. The loop is scripts/lib/mutation-harness.sh;
# resource-waits.test.sh runs this file.
#
# Run directly: scripts/hooks/resource-waits.mutation.sh
# Exit 0 = every property is proven load-bearing.

# THE MERGE GATE LEAVES THIS PASS TO THE NIGHTLY (richos/app/scripts/autocheck/README.md): the
# gate runs the suite with RICHOS_MUTATION_PASSES=0; nightly-engine.py runs every pass.
if [ "${RICHOS_MUTATION_PASSES:-}" = 0 ]; then echo "NOT RUN: $(basename "$0"), a mutation pass (RICHOS_MUTATION_PASSES=0, the merge gate; the nightly runs it)"; exit 0; fi
