# guard-land-lease-commands.sh: PreToolUse[Bash] rule (a module of
# dispatch-pretooluse.sh). The operator fence's SECOND line of defense in the
# shared main checkout (spec r3 e7 item 1, Frank G1 points 2 and 3).
#
# The first line is the Git fence itself: in the main checkout it refuses
# ORIG_HEAD without the land lease, which aborts `git merge` and `git pull`
# BEFORE the tree is touched (Frank G1, measured on both gits). What it cannot
# stop cleanly is a command that writes the tree or its own state first:
# `cherry-pick`, `revert`, `am`, `rebase`, `stash`, `commit` (whose move of main
# the fence refuses only after the index is written), and, measured 2026-09-24
# on both gits against G1's premise, `reset` (the index and tree are rewritten
# before ORIG_HEAD) and `merge --abort` (the staged resolution is discarded
# before ORIG_HEAD, and MERGE_HEAD is left behind). This rule refuses those,
# aimed at a fenced main checkout, when this session does not hold that
# repository's lease, before the command runs.
#
# IT IS A TEXT MATCH AND IT LEAKS (`sh -c`, a script, a variable). Its job is to
# stop a cooperative agent on its habitual path, not an adversary; the Git fence
# is the backstop. The risk that matters is refusing a harmless command, so the
# TARGET is resolved by the checkout it runs in (`git rev-parse` from the path
# after `-C`, else the directory of a leading `cd <dir>`, else the payload's
# cwd), never by a path prefix: a femcboost native worktree sits inside the main
# checkout's directory and has its own top level, and a commit there passes.
#
# WITH THE SWITCH OFF it never refuses: a repository whose launcher is absent or
# says OPERATOR_FENCES_STATE="off" is skipped, and any error in the check is a
# pass, because the Git fence decides anyway.
