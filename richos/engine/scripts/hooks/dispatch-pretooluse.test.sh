# dispatch-pretooluse.test.sh — THE RUNNER SHAPE, PROVEN.
#
# scripts/hooks/dispatch-pretooluse.sh runs N rule modules inside ONE process
# where the host used to run N processes. That trade buys a large latency win
# and takes on one new risk in exchange: twelve rules now share an address
# space, a set of shell options, a stdin and an exit code. Every case below is
# about one of those four.
#
# THE CASES THAT MATTER MOST ARE THE ISOLATION ONES, NOT THE REFUSALS.
# A dispatcher that forwards a refusal is easy. A dispatcher that keeps running
# after one module dies, that does not let module 3's `set -u` reach module 4,
# and that never reports a rule which DID NOT RUN as a rule that passed — that
# is the whole reason this shape is allowed to exist. A rule silently skipped
# is indistinguishable from a rule that found nothing, and this engine's own
# unevaluated-payload library exists because that confusion already happened
# once here, to 17 of 25 PreToolUse guards.
#
# Cases D1-D16 run against a SANDBOX engine with synthetic modules, so a module
# that blocks, errors, hangs on options or writes to stdout can be summoned on
# demand. Cases D17-D22 run against the SHIPPED tree and assert the properties
# the real manifest and the real registration must hold.
#
# The mutation harness proving each assertion load-bearing is
# scripts/hooks/dispatch-pretooluse.mutation.sh, invoked at the end — a harness
# nobody runs proves nothing about anything.
#
# Exit 0 = all cases pass; exit 1 = at least one failure.
