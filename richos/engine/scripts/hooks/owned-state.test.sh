# owned-state.test.sh — the standing-ownership layer: the declaration parser,
#                       the verdict, the report and the gate.
#
# THE CASES THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR ARE 4f AND 4i, and they must be read with 4a.
#
#   4a  proves the gate BITES: an unrelated dispatch is refused while a system
#       the orchestrator owns is standing with nothing done about it.
#   4f  proves the gate LETS GO: once anything at all has been done this
#       session, every later dispatch is silent. That is the case that keeps
#       this guard alive. This project has killed three guards (g11/g12/g13) in
#       a single day by making them broad enough that waiving became the daily
#       habit, and a gate demanding a disposition for each of six systems would
#       have been the fourth. If 4f ever goes red the guard has become a wall.
#   4i  proves the ESCAPE HATCH IS NOT A HOLE. The first version of this hook
#       had one: an ack reading `owned-state-ack: alpha - ...` contains the
#       word `alpha`, matched alpha's own `match:` pattern, and was recorded as
#       a dispatch ADDRESSING the very system it asked to defer — so a bare,
#       malformed ack sailed through as work. Found by running the thing.
#
# AND SECTION 7, added 2026-09-25, is the case this gate failed in production.
# A keyword in a prompt counted as "addressing" a system, the escalation
# backlog reached 143 (the oldest 19 days, 13 for the CEO), and the gate
# cleared itself session after session. 4h now asserts a keyword is REFUSED;
# section 7 runs the SHIPPED escalations row against the SHIPPED list output
# and proves the three things that do count (a real drop, nothing past the
# tolerated age, a named triage) and the ones that do not. Every one of them
# is proven load-bearing by owned-state.mutation.sh.
#
# Exit codes: 0 all cases pass; 1 a case failed.
