# guard-public-record-repo.test.sh — regression tests for
# scripts/hooks/guard-public-record-repo.sh.
#
# THE FIXTURE IS THE REAL SPAWN PROMPT OF 2026-09-19 — the one that sent a
# research read into the PUBLIC repository and put its ledger in published
# history. Every quoted block below is copied from
# .../scratchpad/spawn-r1.prompt.md and from the brief it carries,
# richos-hq/docs/briefs/reed-brief-t3code-tooling-adoption-read-2026-09-19.md.
#
# Covered here:
#
#   (a) REFUSES that dispatch as issued: its workspace resolves to a
#       repository carrying a publication declaration and its deliverable is
#       `docs/research/...`;
#   (b) PASSES THE SAME PROMPT aimed at the private record repository — the
#       only thing that changes is the cross-repo-worktree: line;
#   (c) the PRIOR-ART citations in that same prompt are not deliverables:
#       `richos-hq/docs/research/...` is prefixed and
#       `wiki/ceo-decisions.md` carries no delivery verb;
#   (d) the COMMIT surface: a commit ADDING docs/research/x.md in a
#       publication-bound fixture is REFUSED; the same commit ADDING
#       docs/verification/x.md PASSES, because the CEO's ruling was "remove
#       the two ledger commits and nothing else";
#   (e) a MODIFIED record file is not refused — it is already in history;
#   (f) THE HATCH: `public-record-ack: <30+ characters>` permits and is
#       logged; a bare or short marker exempts nothing and is refused by name;
#   (g) FAIL OPEN: a repository with NO publication declaration, a call for
#       another tool, an unparseable payload, and a declared off switch all
#       allow in silence; a workspace path that resolves to no repository at
#       all ALLOWS and ANNOUNCES;
#   (h) the one hard refusal: a missing scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh.
#
# ===========================================================================
# MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS WIRED
# ===========================================================================
# 302 real documents — every spawn prompt in the ordering session's scratchpad
# and every brief in richos-hq/docs/briefs — driven through the guard as Agent
# payloads. ONE refused: spawn-r1.prompt.md, on
# docs/research/t3code-tooling-what-to-adopt-2026-09-19.md. Nothing else fired
# and nothing was announced.
#
# ONE NARROWING, measured. The delivery-verb list first carried land, lands,
# output, save and saves, and the same prompt's PRIOR-ART line matched on
# "lands" — "8 of 19 lands on richos main were our own tooling", one sentence
# after a bare docs/research/ citation. A verb here must name the production
# of THIS dispatch's own artifact.
#
# Run directly: scripts/hooks/guard-public-record-repo.test.sh
# Exit 0 = all cases pass; exit 1 = at least one failure.

# Brief: read T3 Code's build, test, release, update and harness tooling in full, and say what RichOS can adopt instead of build

**CEO, verbatim, 2026-09-19 22:50Z:** Earlier (richos-hq \`wiki/ceo-decisions.md\` ~line 423): he wants t3code inside the RichOS app.

**What exists (search the record before you start, and cite it):** \`richos-hq/docs/research/t3code-mobile-vs-richos-phone-2026-09-18.md\` (Reed, pinned to \`pingdotgg/t3code\` @ \`8ebb6112\`, MIT) and \`docs/research/t3-relay-exact-details-and-our-cost-2026-09-18.md\` — both scoped to the phone channel and their relay. **Nobody has read their tooling.** Today, 2026-09-19, 8 of 19 lands on richos main were our own tooling.

## What to read, IN FULL, from a fresh clone pinned to a commit

T3 Code's: repository layout and package manager; how they build the desktop app, sign, notarize and publish.

## What to deliver — a committed brief in your worktree, \`docs/research/t3code-tooling-what-to-adopt-2026-09-19.md\`

1. **Per area, one of three verdicts with the file:line evidence:** ADOPT AS-IS, COPY THE APPROACH, NOT APPLICABLE.
