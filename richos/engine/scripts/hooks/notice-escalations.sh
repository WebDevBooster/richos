# notice-escalations.sh — NON-BLOCKING Stop hook. A TURN DOES NOT END QUIETLY
#                          WHILE A TEAMMATE'S ESCALATION IS SITTING UNREAD.
#
# The predicate, and the argument for every constant, is in
# scripts/lib/escalations.py. Read that first. This file is the wiring and the
# one sentence.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE FAILURE
# ===========================================================================
# On 2026-09-02 two teammates finished their work and each recorded, correctly,
# that a premise in its brief was contradicted by evidence. Both wrote
# `BLOCKED.md` on their own branch because that was the protocol. They were
# found on 2026-09-04 by a worktree cleanup, because somebody was counting
# directories. NEITHER WAS A STALL and both were right to be written; what
# failed was the channel.
#
# A file on a teammate's branch is visible only to whoever merges that branch,
# and the teammate cannot see whether its branch was ever merged. So the
# escalation now goes to a ledger outside every repository
# (scripts/lib/escalations.py) and THIS is the half that makes it arrive: every
# turn ends here, and a turn that ends with an unacknowledged escalation says so.
#
# ===========================================================================
# TWO AUDIENCES, AND UNTIL 2026-09-28 ONLY ONE OF THEM WAS REACHED
# ===========================================================================
# The standing bar in this engine is that a deliverable which only reports has
# failed unless the report IS the mechanism. Here it is. Nothing was ever
# missing except the reading: both escalations existed, in git, in full, for two
# days. The artifact that changes the outcome is the ARRIVAL, in the turn after
# it is raised — to the operator AND to the lead's model.
#
# For its first three weeks this hook spoke only `systemMessage`, and a Stop
# hook's systemMessage reaches the PERSON and never the model (the channel
# table below; the hooks reference says "Warning message shown to the user").
# Measured 2026-09-28 in the lead's own session: a teammate's escalation was in
# the ledger at 13:49Z, this hook fired four times after it, and every firing
# sat in the transcript as `hook_success` with `content: ""`. The lead learned
# of it only at the next session start. So the operator's line is now joined,
# in the same JSON object, by `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` carrying
# every NEW escalation in the teammate's own words — the Stop field that does
# reach the model. What counts as new, and why that memory is per session and
# not in the ledger, is argued under "DELIVERY" in scripts/lib/escalations.py.
#
# additionalContext ON Stop CONTINUES THE CONVERSATION, and that is not the
# blocking refused below. The hooks reference: "Non-error feedback for Claude.
# The conversation continues so Claude can act on it, but unlike
# decision: block it is shown in the transcript as hook feedback rather than a
# hook error." Nothing has to be answered or acknowledged for the turn to end;
# each escalation is delivered ONCE per session, so the next turn end has
# nothing new and the lead stops. Raising an escalation costs the lead one
# extra model call, once — which is the arrival this file exists for.
#
# Blocking would be the wrong instrument, for the reason guard-inflight-notify.sh
# gives one event over: it would refuse the LEAD's turn until a third party's
# question has been answered, which is how a guard wedges a session. Worse, it
# would make raising an escalation an act that stops the lead working — and a
# teammate who learns that stops raising them. The escalation channel dies the
# moment it becomes expensive to use.
#
# NO ESCAPE HATCH AND NO CONFIG KEY, for the reason notice-waiver-repetition.sh
# states: an opt-out on the thing that watches for unread escalations is absurd,
# and its absence is why this notice cannot decay.
#
# ===========================================================================
# IT SAYS "THIS IS NOT A STALL" EVERY TIME, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE
# ===========================================================================
# The predicate carries each escalation's `state`, and the sentence names it.
# When nothing outstanding is `stopped`, the line says so in words: the work is
# done or continuing. A notice that read every escalation as a failure would
# teach teammates that raising one gets them treated as stalled, and the next
# correct escalation would not be written at all.
#
# ===========================================================================
# ONE LINE, STATE-CHANGE DE-DUPLICATED — AND IT GETS LOUDER
# ===========================================================================
# systemMessage via scripts/lib/stop-hook-notice.sh, the only channel measured
# to reach the operator (see that file's table). A condition repeated under
# every turn is a condition the eye is trained to skip.
#
# But pure de-duplication has a failure mode this hook cannot afford: a
# condition that never changes is announced once and then never again, and THE
# ORIGINALS SAT FOR TWO DAYS. So the state key the predicate returns carries an
# AGE BUCKET per escalation (1h / 24h / 72h), and crossing a boundary is a state
# change. The ledger stop-hook-notice.sh de-duplicates against is keyed per
# SESSION, so a new session re-announces everything outstanding from scratch.
# Silence about an escalation only ever means "still what I told you this
# session" — never "nobody has one".
#
# NOT SCOPED TO A REPOSITORY, deliberately. A session seated in one repository
# with teammates in worktrees of another is the NORMAL shape of this operation;
# a notice that reported only escalations raised in the seat's own repository
# would hide the common case. It stands down only where the engine is not
# adopted at all, because the plugin loads in every directory on the machine.
#
# NOTE: hook REGISTRATIONS are snapshotted at session start; the script a
# registration names is read from disk at every firing. The model delivery
# added on 2026-09-28 changed no registration (still Stop), so it is live in a
# running session as soon as the installed copy is updated.
#
# UNEVALUATED-PAYLOAD-EXEMPT: payload-independent — the predicate is the escalation ledger, and this hook already
# announces when that predicate is unavailable — 'ESCALATION WATCH IS OFF' and
# 'ESCALATION WATCH PRODUCED NOTHING'. That is this same property implemented
# for a different input. The payload's session id and transcript path decide
# only WHICH escalations this session has already been told about; with none,
# every outstanding escalation is new once, and the text is the same text.
#
# WHY THIS ONE NEEDS A DECLARATION WHERE THE OTHER EXEMPT HOOKS DO NOT.
# scripts/hooks/unevaluated-payload.test.sh derives every registered PreToolUse
# and Stop hook from hooks/hooks.json and drives each with an empty, a truncated
# and a non-JSON payload. A hook that REFUSES them is proven fail-closed by that
# alone; a hook that ANNOUNCES on them is proven audible by that alone; neither
# needs a word in its source. But a hook that is SILENT on all four looks
# identical whether its predicate never needed the payload or its predicate was
# silently lost — which is the whole defect, and it is the one thing driving a
# hook cannot tell you. So payload-independence is the single class that must be
# CLAIMED by a person, and the suite then holds the claim to its consequence:
# the output must be identical on all four payloads. An undeclared silent hook
# fails that suite; a falsely declared one fails it too.

set -eo pipefail

# --- ROOT RESOLUTION -------------------------------------------------------
# TWO ROOTS, NEVER ONE. The full contract, and why the old single-root
# resolution was wrong the moment the engine became loadable by reference,
# is in scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. This bootstrap block is byte-identical
# in every hook that needs a root; contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R asserts
# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
#
# THE BANNER BELOW GOES OUT ON TWO CHANNELS AND ONLY THE SECOND IS HEARD.
# Measured on Claude Code 2.1.270 (macOS, 2026-09-14) by registering one probe
# hook per channel on five events at once and reading the transcript back:
#
#   channel, exit 0     SessionStart  UserPromptSubmit  PreToolUse  PostToolUse  Stop
#   stderr              silent        silent            silent      silent       silent
#   stdout, plain text  model         model             silent      silent       silent
#   {"systemMessage"}   PERSON        PERSON            PERSON      PERSON       PERSON
#   additionalContext   model         model             model       model        model
#
# `silent` is not shorthand: the host records a `hook_success` attachment
# carrying the text in its stderr field and renders it to NO ONE. So a hook
# that could not find its own engine announced a dead enforcement layer
# exactly as loudly as a clean pass. Of the 60 files carrying this block, 35
# exit 2 here — where the host does render stderr, as the refusal reason — and
# 24 exit 0 and were inaudible. The 24 are the notices and observers, which is
# the trap: the hooks that must never block are the hooks nobody could hear.
#
# WHY `systemMessage` AND NOT `additionalContext`. additionalContext must name
# its own event in the envelope, and this block is identical in hooks
# registered on eight different events — it cannot know which one it is on.
# `systemMessage` is event-agnostic and it reaches the operator rather than
# only the model, which is the right audience for "your guards are off".
# Measured too: adding it to an exit-2 hook leaves the refusal untouched —
# same `hook error:` tool result, same blocked write — and only adds a render.
# Nothing here changes what any hook detects, refuses, or exits with.
#
# The escaping is deliberately pure bash (verified on 3.2.57, the macOS system
# shell) and calls nothing external: this is the one code path in the engine
# that runs when the install is already known to be broken, so it must not
# depend on python3, jq, or any file it has just failed to find.
