# guard-public-record-repo.sh — BLOCKING PreToolUse guard on TWO surfaces:
# Agent, and Bash (through dispatch-pretooluse.sh).
#
# THE RECORD DOES NOT GO IN THE PUBLIC REPOSITORY. A dispatch whose deliverable
# is a research read, a brief or a plan is REFUSED when its workspace resolves
# to a publication-bound repository; a commit into such a repository that ADDS
# a file under docs/research/, docs/briefs/ or docs/plans/ is REFUSED.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE RULING, AND THE FAILURE IT WAS GIVEN FOR
# ===========================================================================
# CEO, 2026-09-20 00:10Z, verbatim:
#
#     "how many more times will the wrong shit be put into the Git history in
#      the public repo????"
#
# WHAT HAPPENED. On 2026-09-19 a research read of a third-party project was
# dispatched with `--repo richos` — the PUBLIC, publication-bound repository —
# and its 200-line adoption ledger was committed to `docs/research/` there. It
# was then moved to richos-hq, which does not remove it from history, so the
# repository's main had to be rewritten to drop the two commits. The read
# itself was correct and useful. Only its destination was wrong, and nothing
# between the dispatch and the push asked the question.
#
# THE EXISTING BOUNDARY IS ABOUT CONTENT, AND THIS IS ABOUT CLASS. Its sibling
# guards — guard-publication-writes.sh and guard-publication-commits.sh — scan
# what a file SAYS for private material: recordings, transcripts, a third
# party's speech. They were working, and they passed this file, because a
# tooling read of a public MIT repository contains no private speech at all.
# The defect is not that the ledger leaked something. It is that the record
# BELONGS in the private repository whatever it says, and no rule said so.
#
# So this guard asks a different question of the same declaration, and shares
# its data: `.publication-boundary` (or `.richos/publication-boundary`) is what
# makes a repository public, and PRIVATE_RECORD in it is the answer to "then
# where does this go?". Nothing new is declared and nothing is inferred.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT IS IN SCOPE, AND THE ONE THING DELIBERATELY OUT OF IT
# ===========================================================================
# RECORD CLASSES: docs/research/, docs/briefs/, docs/plans/.
#
# docs/verification/ IS NOT IN SCOPE, and that is the CEO's own line rather
# than a judgment call: the ruling was "remove the two ledger commits and
# nothing else". Verification audits are the evidence a release was walked and
# they already live in the public tree by design. A guard that quietly widened
# a ruling would be the fourth thing in three days to make him ask how many
# more times.
#
# ===========================================================================
# HOW A DISPATCH'S DESTINATION IS DECIDED
# ===========================================================================
# From the prompt's own `cross-repo-worktree:` line(s), and from the payload's
# cwd for a native-isolation spawn. A workspace path that does not exist yet —
# spawn.sh evaluates every PreToolUse[Agent] guard BEFORE creating anything —
# is resolved by the `<repo>-wt/<name>` convention this machine uses, and a
# path that resolves to nothing at all is ANNOUNCED rather than guessed at.
#
# HOW A DELIVERABLE IS DECIDED: a RECORD-CLASS PATH, WRITTEN BARE, ON A LINE
# THAT ALSO CARRIES A DELIVERY VERB. All three conjuncts are load-bearing and
# every one of them is measured against the real prompt of 2026-09-19:
#
#   BARE    `richos-hq/docs/research/t3code-mobile-vs-richos-phone-2026-09-18.md`
#           appears in that same prompt as prior art. It is prefixed with the
#           private repository's name, so it is somebody else's file and not
#           this dispatch's destination. A path preceded by `/` or a word
#           character is never a deliverable here.
#   DELIVERY VERB
#           `wiki/ceo-decisions.md` is cited in that prompt too, as a source.
#           The line that matters reads "## What to deliver — a committed brief
#           in your worktree, `docs/research/...`", and it is the verb that
#           tells a destination from a citation.
#   RECORD CLASS
#           see above; docs/verification/ is out.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE COMMIT SURFACE
# ===========================================================================
# `git commit` whose repository carries a publication declaration and whose
# ADDED set contains a record-class path. ADDED, never modified: an existing
# file is already in history and refusing a change to it would be theater.
# The added set comes from the index and from any `git add` in the same
# command; a command this cannot tokenize falls back to the index alone, which
# is narrower and never wider.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE HATCH
# ===========================================================================
#     public-record-ack: <why this record belongs in the public repository>
#
# on its own line in the prompt, or after a `#` on the commit command line.
# At least 30 characters, a bare marker exempts nothing, and every accepted use
# is appended to <entity root>/.claude/state/public-record-acks.log. There is a
# real class it exists for — a README, a published research note the project
# means to ship — and the file's own name is what makes a habit of it visible.
#
# ===========================================================================
# FAIL OPEN, AND LOUDLY
# ===========================================================================
#   NOT ADOPTED / no publication declaration   -> STAND DOWN, silent. This is
#     every repository that has not declared itself public, which is most of
#     them, and it is why this guard costs nothing almost everywhere.
#   PUBLIC_RECORD_REPO_GUARD="off"             -> STAND DOWN, silent.
#   NO RECORD-CLASS DELIVERABLE / NOTHING ADDED -> SILENT.
#   A WORKSPACE PATH THAT RESOLVES TO NOTHING  -> ALLOW + ANNOUNCE, and only
#     when a record deliverable was actually seen. "I cannot tell which
#     repository" is never "forbidden", and it is never silent either.
#   PAYLOAD UNPARSEABLE, python3 MISSING       -> ALLOW + ANNOUNCE.
#
# The one thing that is NOT fail-open: scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh missing.
#
# NOTE: hooks are snapshotted at session start. This one is INERT until the
# next session.

set -eo pipefail
# --- ROOT RESOLUTION -------------------------------------------------------
# TWO ROOTS, NEVER ONE. The full contract, and why the old single-root
# resolution was wrong the moment the engine became loadable by reference,
# is in scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. This bootstrap block is byte-identical
# in every hook that needs a root; contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R asserts
# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
#
# THE BANNER BELOW GOES OUT ON TWO CHANNELS AND ONLY THE SECOND IS HEARD.
# Measured on Claude Code 2.1.270 (macOS, 2026-09-14) by registering one probe
# hook per channel on five events at once and reading the transcript back:
#
#   channel, exit 0     SessionStart  UserPromptSubmit  PreToolUse  PostToolUse  Stop
#   stderr              silent        silent            silent      silent       silent
#   stdout, plain text  model         model             silent      silent       silent
#   {"systemMessage"}   PERSON        PERSON            PERSON      PERSON       PERSON
#   additionalContext   model         model             model       model        model
#
# `silent` is not shorthand: the host records a `hook_success` attachment
# carrying the text in its stderr field and renders it to NO ONE. So a hook
# that could not find its own engine announced a dead enforcement layer
# exactly as loudly as a clean pass. Of the 60 files carrying this block, 35
# exit 2 here — where the host does render stderr, as the refusal reason — and
# 24 exit 0 and were inaudible. The 24 are the notices and observers, which is
# the trap: the hooks that must never block are the hooks nobody could hear.
#
# WHY `systemMessage` AND NOT `additionalContext`. additionalContext must name
# its own event in the envelope, and this block is identical in hooks
# registered on eight different events — it cannot know which one it is on.
# `systemMessage` is event-agnostic and it reaches the operator rather than
# only the model, which is the right audience for "your guards are off".
# Measured too: adding it to an exit-2 hook leaves the refusal untouched —
# same `hook error:` tool result, same blocked write — and only adds a render.
# Nothing here changes what any hook detects, refuses, or exits with.
#
# The escaping is deliberately pure bash (verified on 3.2.57, the macOS system
# shell) and calls nothing external: this is the one code path in the engine
# that runs when the install is already known to be broken, so it must not
# depend on python3, jq, or any file it has just failed to find.
