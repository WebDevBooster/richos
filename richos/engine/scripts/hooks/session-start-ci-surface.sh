# session-start-ci-surface.sh — SessionStart notice. Never blocks.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THIS IS FOR, AND WHAT IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT
# ===========================================================================
# The gate (guard-ci-red-lands.sh) makes red cost something at the land. The
# watch (ci-surface-watch.sh) reads the whole surface unattended. Neither of
# them puts a single word in front of a person, so on a machine where nobody
# lands anything for a week, both work perfectly and nobody learns anything.
#
# This is the third leg. It is a NOTICE, it blocks nothing, and it is narrow on
# purpose, because a session-start banner that says something every time is a
# banner people stop reading — and this engine already carries eight of them.
#
# IT SAYS NOTHING AT ALL unless one of exactly two things is true:
#
#   1. RED IS STANDING in a governed repository, with the age of each streak.
#      Red for thirteen days is the fact that started all of this, and an age
#      is what makes it obviously wrong rather than merely present.
#
#   2. THE UNATTENDED WATCH IS NOT WORKING — it reported `degraded` or
#      `ineffective`, or it has not run at all, or it is not installed. This is
#      the "who watches the watchman" leg and it is the one most likely to
#      matter: a scheduled job that quietly stops is indistinguishable from a
#      clean surface, and the job this whole subsystem is modeled against has
#      been firing daily and reclaiming nothing for weeks.
#
# The other five axes are NOT in this notice. They are real, they are reported
# in full by `ci-status.sh`, and putting forty UNDECLARED lines on a session
# banner would guarantee nobody reads the two lines that matter today.
#
# ===========================================================================
# IT READS THE CACHE AND NEVER THE NETWORK
# ===========================================================================
# A SessionStart hook that makes API calls adds seconds to the start of every
# session, and a slow start is how a notice gets removed. Everything here comes
# off files the watch already wrote. If those files are absent or stale, THAT
# IS THE FINDING and it says so — the absence of a reading is exactly what
# case 2 is about.

#
# (scripts/lib/stop-hook-notice.sh lines 20-32; the five-event form is repeated
# in scripts/hooks/notice-escalations.sh lines 110-116.)
#
# So the third leg of the CI subsystem — the one whose own header says it
# exists because the gate and the watch "put no single word in front of a
# person" — put its word on the one channel measured to reach no person.
# Found by scripts/check-census.py, which classified it INERT: it neither
# refuses, nor announces on an audible channel, nor records. Reproduced while
# it was holding a live finding (CI IS RED, 1 workflow): 223 bytes on stderr,
# 0 on stdout, exit 0. Record: docs/verification/check-census-2026-09-14.md.
#
# Nothing about WHAT it says changes, and it still blocks nothing. The text is
# now carried on both audible channels — systemMessage for the operator, who
# is the person who can act on a red surface, and additionalContext for the
# model, which is what stops the orchestrator reporting a clean surface in the
# same turn. This is exactly the pair session-start-escalations.sh uses, and
# for the reason that file gives: a notice only the model hears is one the
# orchestrator may summarize away; one only the operator hears is one the
# orchestrator does not know it owes an answer to.
#
# STDERR IS NOT KEPT ALONGSIDE. It renders to nobody, and a duplicate copy of
# the same text on a third channel is what made this hook's own suite count
# thirteen rows in a twelve-row list when the fix was first tried.
