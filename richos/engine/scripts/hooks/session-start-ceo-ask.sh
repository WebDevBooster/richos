# session-start-ceo-ask.sh — SessionStart hook. OPEN WITH HIS QUESTION, NOT
#                            WITH A COUNT OF HIS QUESTIONS.
#
# The predicate is scripts/lib/ceo-asks.sh. This file is four lines of wiring
# and one design decision, and the decision is the whole file.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE DECISION: A QUESTION, NOT A NUMBER
# ===========================================================================
# On the morning of 2026-08-31 the CEO opened a session and asked "what's next".
# He was given a backlog report — a count and a list of work — and an engineer
# was dispatched. His own prepared questions sat inside that report and were
# never put to him. He asked three times, the last in capitals.
#
# "13 items waiting" is that report in miniature. It is TRUE, it is FINDABLE,
# and it is the exact shape of the thing that got demoted, because a count is
# something to acknowledge and get past. When one of those items was finally
# rendered as a specific answerable question, it was answered in seconds.
#
# So this hook names ONE item and renders it as a question he could answer
# without opening anything, and puts the count BEHIND it rather than in front.
# Same rule notice-unstarted-rows.sh states as "NAMED, NOT COUNTED", applied to
# the one audience that cannot be re-briefed.
#
# TWO CHANNELS, both, always — engine-status.sh's rule and its measurement:
# `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` reaches the MODEL and nothing else;
# `systemMessage` reaches the OPERATOR. A question announced only to the model
# is a question the orchestrator may summarize away, which is what happened. A
# question announced only to the operator is one the orchestrator does not know
# it owes. Both, or the announcement has a hole exactly where this defect lives.
#
# IT ANNOUNCES NOTHING when there is no CEO list here, when the list is empty,
# or when every prepared item has already been put to him. Silence is the
# healthy state and is never spent on saying so.
#
# NEVER BLOCKS (SessionStart hooks must not), always exits 0.

set -o pipefail

# --- ROOT RESOLUTION -------------------------------------------------------
# TWO ROOTS, NEVER ONE. The full contract, and why the old single-root
# resolution was wrong the moment the engine became loadable by reference,
# is in scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. This bootstrap block is byte-identical
# in every hook that needs a root; contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R asserts
# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
#
# THE BANNER BELOW GOES OUT ON TWO CHANNELS AND ONLY THE SECOND IS HEARD.
# Measured on Claude Code 2.1.270 (macOS, 2026-09-14) by registering one probe
# hook per channel on five events at once and reading the transcript back:
#
#   channel, exit 0     SessionStart  UserPromptSubmit  PreToolUse  PostToolUse  Stop
#   stderr              silent        silent            silent      silent       silent
#   stdout, plain text  model         model             silent      silent       silent
#   {"systemMessage"}   PERSON        PERSON            PERSON      PERSON       PERSON
#   additionalContext   model         model             model       model        model
#
# `silent` is not shorthand: the host records a `hook_success` attachment
# carrying the text in its stderr field and renders it to NO ONE. So a hook
# that could not find its own engine announced a dead enforcement layer
# exactly as loudly as a clean pass. Of the 60 files carrying this block, 35
# exit 2 here — where the host does render stderr, as the refusal reason — and
# 24 exit 0 and were inaudible. The 24 are the notices and observers, which is
# the trap: the hooks that must never block are the hooks nobody could hear.
#
# WHY `systemMessage` AND NOT `additionalContext`. additionalContext must name
# its own event in the envelope, and this block is identical in hooks
# registered on eight different events — it cannot know which one it is on.
# `systemMessage` is event-agnostic and it reaches the operator rather than
# only the model, which is the right audience for "your guards are off".
# Measured too: adding it to an exit-2 hook leaves the refusal untouched —
# same `hook error:` tool result, same blocked write — and only adds a render.
# Nothing here changes what any hook detects, refuses, or exits with.
#
# The escaping is deliberately pure bash (verified on 3.2.57, the macOS system
# shell) and calls nothing external: this is the one code path in the engine
# that runs when the install is already known to be broken, so it must not
# depend on python3, jq, or any file it has just failed to find.
