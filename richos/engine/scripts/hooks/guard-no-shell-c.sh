# NEVER LET CLAUDE CODE'S "shell -c script could not be checked" PROMPT REACH THE USER.
#
# The CEO, 2026-10-09: "This shell -c script runs rm and could not be checked. Do you want to
# proceed?" appeared on his screen for a teammate's command; he hit yes and hoped app users would
# not be bothered by it (the same prompt reached him on 2026-10-07 from the lead's commands). Claude
# Code cannot check an inline `bash -c '...'` script, so it asks. A hook that DENIES runs first, so the
# agent gets the rewrite (separate commands, or a script file run with `bash <file>`) and nobody is asked.
#
# The rule is scripts/lib/shell_c.py (a text match; it leaks, any error in it is a pass). The RichOS
# app does not run this chain: its hook, scripts/app-engine-hook.py, applies the same rule through
# mega-lander/app.py validate_shell_target. Suite: guard-no-shell-c.test.sh.
