# A TEAMMATE NEVER DELETES INSIDE THE LEAD SESSION'S DIRECTORY.
#
# 2026-10-01: Claude Code tells every in-process teammate that the lead session's
# scratchpad (<root>/<project>/<session-id>/scratchpad) is ITS OWN scratchpad. It is
# shared. Two teammates, obeying "delete your disposable scratch before reporting",
# ran `rm -rf <session>/scratchpad/*` and `rm -f <session>/scratchpad/*` and took the
# lead's briefs and a live teammate's helper scripts, logs and backup copy of a file it
# was mutating. The rule and the full record are in scripts/lib/shared_scratchpad.py.
#
# Refused: a call made inside a subagent (its payload carries agent_id) whose rm,
# rmdir, unlink, trash, srm or find -delete/-exec rm reaches inside a session directory
# under a Claude scratch root, that directory, or a directory above it. The lead's own
# calls pass. A teammate's own /Volumes/E1TB/tmp/claude/<name>/ is not this rule's
# business and passes.
#
# There is no exemption marker, deliberately: no delete in the shared scratchpad is ever
# needed (the scratch reaper removes the session directory after the session ends), and a
# marker would be the first thing the next end-of-task cleanup learned to add.
#
# IT IS A TEXT MATCH AND IT LEAKS (a script, `sh -c "$X"`, a Python rmtree). Its job is
# the habitual cleanup command. Any error in the check is a pass.
