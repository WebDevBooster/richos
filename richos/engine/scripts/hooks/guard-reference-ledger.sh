# guard-reference-ledger.sh — BLOCKING PreToolUse guard on the Agent tool.
#
# REFUSES A DISPATCH THAT BUILDS ON A SURFACE A NAMED REFERENCE HAS ALREADY
# ANSWERED, UNLESS THE PROMPT CITES THE ROW.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE RULING, AND THE FAILURE IT WAS GIVEN FOR
# ===========================================================================
# CEO, 2026-09-19 23:15-23:25Z, verbatim:
#
#     "In other words, you ARE FUCKING REINVENTING THE FUCKING WHEEL FROM
#      SCRATCH"
#
#     "WHEN WILL ALL THIS WRITTEN DOWN SO THAT I DON'T GET MY FUCKING TIME
#      WASTED WITH THIS RETARDED-FUCK REINVENTION OF THE FUCKING WHEEL???"
#
# Written down the same night as femcboost CLAUDE.md's hard rule "Never
# Reinvent What a Named Reference Already Solved" (commit 321dbc263) and
# richos-hq wiki/ceo-decisions.md §66. This file is the mechanism that rule
# promises, and the answer to the second sentence is that it is enforced here
# rather than remembered.
#
# WHAT HAPPENED, because it decides this file's shape. On 2026-09-18 Reed read
# T3 Code's phone stack in full and named the connection runtime and the outbox
# as the things to take for our phone path
# (richos-hq/docs/research/t3code-mobile-vs-richos-phone-2026-09-18.md §1
# item 6). Three phone briefs followed on 2026-09-19. Not one of them cited it;
# all three patched richos/web/web-app/lib/link.js from first principles. The
# read existed, it was correct, it was in the record, and nobody opened it at
# the moment of writing a brief.
#
# A rule enforced by remembering lasts exactly as long as the remembering. That
# is the same finding guard-no-home-network-phone.sh was built from one day
# earlier, and it is why this is a hook and not a paragraph.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE SURFACES ARE DATA, NOT CODE
# ===========================================================================
# scripts/hooks/adoption-ledger.surfaces is one record per ledger area: its
# section, its verdict, the PATH FRAGMENTS of our code it covers, and the
# PHRASES that name it in prose. Adding an area is an edit to that file and
# never an edit to this one. The file's own header explains the format; the
# guard reads it and nothing else.
#
# The file is searched for in three places, first hit wins:
#
#   $RICHOS_REFERENCE_LEDGER_SURFACES        explicit; also the test affordance
#   <entity root>/.richos/adoption-ledger.surfaces   an adopter's own rows
#   <engine root>/scripts/hooks/adoption-ledger.surfaces   the shipped default
#
# THE DATA FILE DOES NOT LIVE IN THE REPOSITORY THAT HOLDS THE LEDGER, and
# that is a deviation from the brief that ordered this guard, stated here
# rather than buried. The brief prescribed richos-hq/docs/research/. Two facts
# decided otherwise. (1) This guard fires in a femcboost session, for a
# dispatch into richos, against a document in richos-hq: three repositories,
# and nothing in this engine locates the third deterministically. A guard whose
# DATA lives somewhere it may not find stands down silently on the machine
# where the checkout is missing, which is the exact silent-skip failure
# scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh exists to end. (2) Every other guard datum in
# this engine ships with the guard — scripts/lib/ci-known-red.tsv,
# ci-unit-weights.tsv, dialect-en-US.dict, scripts/hooks/dispatch-pretooluse.manifest.
# The LEDGER stays where it is and is named by the data file; only the SIGNALS
# ship with the code that reads them.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE TEST: THREE CONJUNCTS, AND THE MIDDLE ONE IS WHY IT DOES NOT FIRE ON
# EVERY BRIEF THAT SAYS THE WORD "PHONE"
# ===========================================================================
#   (a) A BUILD SECTION EXISTS. A markdown heading naming the files this
#       teammate will EDIT — Scope, Scope and files, What to build, What to
#       change, What to fix, Files, Implementation, The work. The section runs
#       to the next heading at the same level or higher. TEXT OUTSIDE EVERY
#       BUILD SECTION IS NOT READ FOR SIGNALS AT ALL, which is what keeps a
#       narrative paragraph ("Ray measured 7,288 ms on the phone page") from
#       being treated as an instruction to build on the phone page.
#
#   (b) A LEDGER SIGNAL INSIDE THAT SECTION. A path fragment or a phrase from
#       adoption-ledger.surfaces. Inside a Scope section a backticked path IS
#       the signal, so — unlike guard-no-home-network-phone.sh — inline code
#       spans are deliberately NOT stripped here. Opposite decision, opposite
#       reason: there a backtick marks somebody else's words, here it marks the
#       file about to be edited.
#
#   (c) THE DISPATCH IS NOT A READ. A prompt that tells its teammate not to
#       change the code — "Do not fix anything; record it", "Do not modify
#       anything under richos/app", "read-only", "do not write code" — is a
#       research or QA dispatch and is never refused, whatever it names. This
#       conjunct is not decoration: it is the one that passes Reed's own
#       adoption-read brief, which is DENSER in ledger signals than any build
#       brief in the corpus (it commissions the ledger) and must obviously pass.
#
# WHY (a) AND (c) BOTH, when either alone nearly works: measured, each alone
# has a failure the other covers. Ray's VM walk has no build heading but names
# scripts; Reed's read has "## What to deliver" and a scope-shaped list of
# areas. The conjunction is what makes "builds on it" a fact about the text
# rather than a judgment about the author.
#
# ===========================================================================
# MEASURED, ON REAL TEXT, BEFORE IT WAS WIRED
# ===========================================================================
# Every brief in richos-hq/docs/briefs (288 .md files) plus every spawn prompt
# of the session that ordered this guard (37), driven through THIS FILE as real
# Agent payloads. The numbers, the fires and the judgment on each one are in
# guard-reference-ledger.test.sh's header, where a reader can re-run them.
#
# Reproduce before changing any pattern here: build an Agent payload per
# document and pipe it in. The classifier is this file's own python3 block, so
# the measurement is of the shipped rule and not of a model of it.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE HATCH IS A CITATION OR AN ARGUED "NONE" — NEVER A MARKER
# ===========================================================================
#     reference: adoption ledger §2.5 — ADOPT AS-IS, derive the port from the
#                worktree path
#
# needs a LEDGER NAME (the document's file name, or the name the data file
# declares) AND A SECTION, and the section MUST EXIST in the ledger. The guard
# opens the document and looks for the heading; a citation of a section that is
# not there is refused BY NAME. Half the value of the hatch is being made to
# open the file — which is precisely the step the three phone briefs skipped.
#
#     reference: none — <at least 40 characters saying why no row covers this>
#
# is the honest answer when the surface genuinely is not in the ledger, and it
# is logged to .claude/state/reference-none.log so a habit of waiving is
# visible rather than invisible. A BARE `reference:` exempts nothing and is
# refused by name.
#
# Where the ledger cannot be located at all, a citation is accepted on its
# shape and the log says UNVERIFIED. "I cannot check" is never "forbidden".
#
# ===========================================================================
# FAIL OPEN, AND LOUDLY
# ===========================================================================
#   NOT ADOPTED (no orchestration.config)  -> STAND DOWN, silent.
#   REFERENCE_LEDGER_GUARD="off"           -> STAND DOWN, silent.
#   NOT AN Agent CALL                      -> silent.
#   NO BUILD SECTION / NO SIGNAL / A READ  -> SILENT. This is the overwhelming
#                                             majority of all dispatches.
#   THE SURFACES FILE IS MISSING           -> ALLOW + ANNOUNCE. The engine ships
#                                             one, so its absence is a broken
#                                             install, not a policy.
#   PAYLOAD UNPARSEABLE, python3 MISSING   -> ALLOW + ANNOUNCE.
#   THE LEDGER DOCUMENT UNREADABLE         -> the citation is accepted on its
#                                             shape, logged UNVERIFIED. It NEVER
#                                             turns a pass into a refusal.
#
# The one thing that is NOT fail-open: scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh missing.
#
# NOTE: hooks are snapshotted at session start. This one is INERT until the
# next session — it assumes nothing about being live in the session that adds
# it, and the session that added it is the session that wrote the three briefs.

set -eo pipefail
# --- ROOT RESOLUTION -------------------------------------------------------
# TWO ROOTS, NEVER ONE. The full contract, and why the old single-root
# resolution was wrong the moment the engine became loadable by reference,
# is in scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. This bootstrap block is byte-identical
# in every hook that needs a root; contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R asserts
# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
#
# THE BANNER BELOW GOES OUT ON TWO CHANNELS AND ONLY THE SECOND IS HEARD.
# Measured on Claude Code 2.1.270 (macOS, 2026-09-14) by registering one probe
# hook per channel on five events at once and reading the transcript back:
#
#   channel, exit 0     SessionStart  UserPromptSubmit  PreToolUse  PostToolUse  Stop
#   stderr              silent        silent            silent      silent       silent
#   stdout, plain text  model         model             silent      silent       silent
#   {"systemMessage"}   PERSON        PERSON            PERSON      PERSON       PERSON
#   additionalContext   model         model             model       model        model
#
# `silent` is not shorthand: the host records a `hook_success` attachment
# carrying the text in its stderr field and renders it to NO ONE. So a hook
# that could not find its own engine announced a dead enforcement layer
# exactly as loudly as a clean pass. Of the 60 files carrying this block, 35
# exit 2 here — where the host does render stderr, as the refusal reason — and
# 24 exit 0 and were inaudible. The 24 are the notices and observers, which is
# the trap: the hooks that must never block are the hooks nobody could hear.
#
# WHY `systemMessage` AND NOT `additionalContext`. additionalContext must name
# its own event in the envelope, and this block is identical in hooks
# registered on eight different events — it cannot know which one it is on.
# `systemMessage` is event-agnostic and it reaches the operator rather than
# only the model, which is the right audience for "your guards are off".
# Measured too: adding it to an exit-2 hook leaves the refusal untouched —
# same `hook error:` tool result, same blocked write — and only adds a render.
# Nothing here changes what any hook detects, refuses, or exits with.
#
# The escaping is deliberately pure bash (verified on 3.2.57, the macOS system
# shell) and calls nothing external: this is the one code path in the engine
# that runs when the install is already known to be broken, so it must not
# depend on python3, jq, or any file it has just failed to find.
