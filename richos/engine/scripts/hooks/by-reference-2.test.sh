# 2f2 — A TENTH PreToolUse[Agent] HOOK, REGISTERED AND DECLARED, IS GREEN.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THIS IS THE CASE THAT DID NOT EXIST ON 2026-09-14, and its absence is the
# whole reason that day cost a red `main`. guard-brief-scope.sh was registered
# as the NINTH Agent hook, correctly, and the engine went red — not because
# anything was wrong with it, but because two consumers inside the probe held a
# TYPED copy of the chain that still said eight. Every existing case here
# mutates the engine and asserts a REFUSAL; not one of them asked the opposite
# question, which is the one an engine that expects to grow has to answer:
#
#     DOES A CORRECTLY ADDED HOOK PASS?
#
# So this case adds a tenth, exactly the way the tenth will really be added —
# appended to the Agent chain in hooks/hooks.json, declared in the managed set,
# on disk, executable, hash-matched — and asserts the probe is GREEN.
#
# It fails on the pre-fix code, which is what makes it worth keeping: there,
# Layer C's typed CANONICAL_AGENT_CHAIN and BR2's typed BR_AGENT_WANT would both
# report the new hook as the defect. It is the negative control for the
# derivation itself — re-type either list and this case goes red.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY STILL COSTS: one line in BR_EXPECTED. That table is the
# probe's INDEPENDENT oracle and deriving it would make BR2 tautological (its
# own header says so), so a tenth hook still has to be DECLARED. The difference
# is that the probe names that one line when it is missing — case 2f above —
# whereas the two typed chains named nothing and failed somewhere else entirely.
#
# HOW "IT WAS ACTUALLY COUNTED" IS ASSERTED. A green BR2 prints a COUNT, not a
# roster — "all N managed guards registered exactly once …" — so grepping the
# output for the new hook's name proves nothing either way (the first draft of
# this case did exactly that and failed against a working engine). The
# observable that does carry the claim is the count itself: it must be exactly
# one higher than the same sandbox reports unmutated. A layer that skipped the
# tenth hook would print the baseline number and still be green, which is the
# 14/14-guards defect this engine has already paid for twice.
