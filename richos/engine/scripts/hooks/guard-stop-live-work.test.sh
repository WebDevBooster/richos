# guard-stop-live-work.test.sh — the acceptance suite for the PreToolUse
# [TaskStop] gate.
#
# THE HEADLINE CASES ARE THE TWO REAL KILLS OF 2026-09-10, reconstructed from
# the session transcript. If either of them ever passes again, this suite is
# red.
#
# THE SECOND HEADLINE IS 2026-09-20: this guard must not read anybody's
# sentences at all. The deleted "authority B" allowed a kill when a regex found
# a stop imperative in the last user message, and it answered AUTHORIZES to
# "how is the stop command coming along". The section HIS SENTENCES ARE NOT AN
# INPUT holds that ground structurally — by the absence of the code, by the CLI
# refusing the arguments that fed it, and end to end against a transcript in
# which the user plainly orders the stop.
#
# Everything else here exists to keep the guard NARROW: a gate that also
# refuses self-stops, protocol traffic or the cleanup of a finished teammate
# would be waived within a day, and a habitually waived guard is a dead guard
# that still looks alive.
