# Registered SessionStart AND UserPromptSubmit. The predicate, every

# that belong to a hook rather than to a library.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THIS IS FOR
# ===========================================================================
# 2026-09-15. Nine-hour break. He came back and asked "TLDR, plain English",
# and was answered about a guard-deletion step, because that is what the lead
# was holding. SIXTEEN MESSAGES AND THIRTY-NINE MINUTES later he had the one
# line he wanted, after re-pasting his own messages from the night before:
#
#     "HOW MANY MORE FUCKING MESSAGES FROM LAST NIGHT DO I NEED TO COPY AND
#      PASTE HERE???? HOW MANY IDENTICAL FUCKING QUESTIONS FROM LAST NIGHT DO
#      I FUCKING NEED TO ASK AGAIN HERE"
#
# Lifecycle failure types 60 and 61. The answer to "how many" is zero, and it
# is zero because a mechanism puts it there rather than because somebody
# remembers to look.
#
# ===========================================================================
# IT IS NOT A GUARD — IT REFUSES NOTHING
# ===========================================================================
# The standing rule since 2026-09-14 is that a new guard costs a deleted one,
# or a written reason the error cannot be designed out. This does not qualify
# and does not need to: it has no refusal, no exit code anybody clears, no
# acknowledgement line and no way to block a turn. Every path exits 0. It is an
# ANSWER delivered before the question is asked.
#
# WHY A NEW FILE RATHER THAN A LINE IN AN EXISTING ONE, since the brief asked
# for that preference and it is the right preference. Seven hooks run at
# SessionStart and ONE runs at UserPromptSubmit. The requirement is that this
# fires on a GAP, and the session this exists for ran 33 hours across three of
# his sleep cycles — a SessionStart-only report would have fired once, on the
# 13th, and been silent on the morning it was needed. So it has to be on
# UserPromptSubmit, where the only resident is commit-ceo-inputs.sh: an INGRESS
# that commits files he hands over, whose whole body is git side effects and
# refusal gates, and which is registered on one event only. Extending it would
# have meant a second unrelated predicate inside a hook that must never block,
# registered on an event it was never written for. What IS reused, and it is
# the substantive half: repository discovery and the integration-branch
# question come from scripts/lib/unlanded-branches.py and workspaces.py
# unchanged, so there is no second answer to "has this landed" anywhere in the
# engine.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE CHANNEL — BOTH AUDIENCES, AND additionalContext IS THE LOAD-BEARING ONE
# ===========================================================================
# Measured on Claude Code 2.1.270 (macOS, 2026-09-14) by registering one probe
# hook per channel on five events at once and reading the transcript back —
# the table carried verbatim in every hook of this engine that resolves a root:
#
#   channel, exit 0     SessionStart  UserPromptSubmit  PreToolUse  PostToolUse  Stop
#   stderr              silent        silent            silent      silent       silent
#   stdout, plain text  model         model             silent      silent       silent
#   {"systemMessage"}   PERSON        PERSON            PERSON      PERSON       PERSON
#   additionalContext   model         model             model       model        model
#
# THE MODEL IS THE AUDIENCE THAT HAS TO ACT, so the report goes on
# `additionalContext`, which is measured to reach it on both of this hook's
# events. `systemMessage` reaches the PERSON and nothing else — and that is
# exactly how a staleness notice named a dead guard all day while nobody acted
# on it. So the person gets ONE LINE and the model gets the report; a hook that
# put the report on `systemMessage` would be rebuilding the defect.
#
# hookEventName is spelled from --event and must match the event the host
# fired, because a mismatch makes the host DROP the whole object. That is also
# why the event is an ARGUMENT rather than something read from the payload:
# see the stdin note below.
#
# ===========================================================================
# STDIN — READ ON ONE EVENT, NEVER ON THE OTHER, AND THE ARGUMENT IS WHY
# ===========================================================================
# engine-status.sh measured the hazard: a SessionStart hook is also runnable by
# hand, and in that case stdin is an inherited pipe nobody closes, so an
# unconditional `cat` hangs — 92 seconds and counting inside the contract
# probe before it was reverted, and `[ ! -t 0 ]` does not help because an
# inherited pipe is not a TTY.
#
# So the event comes from the REGISTRATION, as `--event`, and:
#   SessionStart      never touches stdin. It does not need to: the transcript
#                     is found from CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, which the probe
#                     measured present and correct in a plugin-loaded hook at
#                     SessionStart, and there is no arriving prompt to exclude.
#   UserPromptSubmit  reads the payload with `cat`, exactly as
#                     commit-ceo-inputs.sh has on this event since it shipped.
#                     It needs `prompt` — see left-off.py on why the arriving
#                     message is excluded by identity rather than by timing.
#
# ===========================================================================
# IT SPEAKS ONCE PER GAP, AND THEN ONCE MORE, TWICE
# ===========================================================================
# The full report is emitted on the first message after a gap. The next two
# messages get ONE LINE repeating his pre-gap question verbatim, and after that
# it is silent until the next gap.
#
# The two are not decoration. Type 60's aggravating detail is that retrieval
# ALREADY WORKED — the lead printed his 21:39 message on screen and answered
# something else anyway — and he then sent fifteen more messages. A single
# emission that gets reasoned past has no second chance; two one-line anchors
# cost 240 characters between them and are the cheapest possible insurance
# against exactly the failure that is recorded.
#
# ===========================================================================
# COST
# ===========================================================================
# Measured on the 18 MB / 10031-line transcript of the session it was written
# in, with three git repositories in scope (femcboost, richos, richos-hq):
# 1.86 s wall for one whole run of THIS FILE producing a full report, of which
# 1.45 s is the analyzer (three runs: 1.45 / 1.48 / 1.44). When there is no gap
# the analyzer takes 0.18 s and stops before any git call at all, and that is
# the common case -- it is what almost every message pays. The numbers and the
# commands that produce them are in docs/verification/left-off-2026-09-15.md.
#
# Stand down with CHECK_LEFT_OFF=0 in orchestration.config — announced, never
# silent.
#
# Verify a live install:  scripts/hooks/left-off-report.sh --self-test
# Read it by hand:        scripts/hooks/left-off-report.sh --report
#
# Exit codes: always 0. This hook never refuses anything.

# --- ROOT RESOLUTION -------------------------------------------------------
# TWO ROOTS, NEVER ONE. The full contract, and why the old single-root
# resolution was wrong the moment the engine became loadable by reference,
# is in scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh. This bootstrap block is byte-identical
# in every hook that needs a root; contract-integrity-probe.sh Layer R asserts
# that, so a divergent copy is a probe failure rather than a surprise.
#
# THE BANNER BELOW GOES OUT ON TWO CHANNELS AND ONLY THE SECOND IS HEARD.
# Measured on Claude Code 2.1.270 (macOS, 2026-09-14) by registering one probe
# hook per channel on five events at once and reading the transcript back:
#
#   channel, exit 0     SessionStart  UserPromptSubmit  PreToolUse  PostToolUse  Stop
#   stderr              silent        silent            silent      silent       silent
#   stdout, plain text  model         model             silent      silent       silent
#   {"systemMessage"}   PERSON        PERSON            PERSON      PERSON       PERSON
#   additionalContext   model         model             model       model        model
#
# `silent` is not shorthand: the host records a `hook_success` attachment
# carrying the text in its stderr field and renders it to NO ONE. So a hook
# that could not find its own engine announced a dead enforcement layer
# exactly as loudly as a clean pass. Of the 60 files carrying this block, 35
# exit 2 here — where the host does render stderr, as the refusal reason — and
# 24 exit 0 and were inaudible. The 24 are the notices and observers, which is
# the trap: the hooks that must never block are the hooks nobody could hear.
#
# WHY `systemMessage` AND NOT `additionalContext`. additionalContext must name
# its own event in the envelope, and this block is identical in hooks
# registered on eight different events — it cannot know which one it is on.
# `systemMessage` is event-agnostic and it reaches the operator rather than
# only the model, which is the right audience for "your guards are off".
# Measured too: adding it to an exit-2 hook leaves the refusal untouched —
# same `hook error:` tool result, same blocked write — and only adds a render.
# Nothing here changes what any hook detects, refuses, or exits with.
#
# The escaping is deliberately pure bash (verified on 3.2.57, the macOS system
# shell) and calls nothing external: this is the one code path in the engine
# that runs when the install is already known to be broken, so it must not
# depend on python3, jq, or any file it has just failed to find.
