# notice-claim-capability.sh — PostToolUse. THE CLAIM-CAPABILITY CHECK, DELIVERED WHERE IT
#                              ACTUALLY FIRES: the moment a RECORD is written.
#
# ===========================================================================================
# WHY THIS EXISTS — the check was built and pointed at the wrong surface
# ===========================================================================================
# `scripts/brief-provenance.py` grew a fourth check on 2026-09-14 (record:
# docs/verification/claim-capability-2026-09-14.md). It reads a sentence that DOES cite a
# source and states what that source is capable of establishing — a state measurement answers
# what IS; it never answers who did it, when, whether it was allowed, or which of several
# candidates it was.
#
# It was wired into the spawn path, because that is where `brief-provenance.py` already ran.
# Its author measured the result and reported it rather than burying it:
#
#     23 spawn payloads -> 1 row, and that row is a false positive.
#     63 landed records -> 37 rows.
#
# NOT ONE of the four real instances of the failure happened in a brief. Two were in landed
# `docs/verification/` records, one in a memory note, one typed to the CEO in chat. So the
# check sat on a surface where type Y does not happen.
#
# This hook is the delivery surface, and NOTHING ELSE. It reuses
# `brief-provenance.py`'s predicate by importing it; there is no second copy of the rules
# here, and none of them is re-tuned. A hook-shaped reimplementation beside the real one is
# the defect class this engine keeps finding in itself.
#
# ===========================================================================================
# THE CONSTRAINT THIS WAS BUILT UNDER, AND THE MEASUREMENT THAT ANSWERS IT
# ===========================================================================================
# The brief was explicit: this session has repeatedly produced mechanisms nobody reads, and
# "if your own measurement says this becomes wallpaper, say so and do not ship it."
#
# THIS HOOK, not a model of it, was replayed against every write-shaped tool call recorded in
# the 753 session transcripts under `~/.claude/projects/` that names a record path:
#
#     1035 calls replayed
#       14 of them (1.4%) produced a notice, carrying 15 rows in total
#     1021 stayed SILENT, and the reasons are separated rather than pooled:
#          500  the file no longer exists at that path — a REPLAY ARTIFACT, not the hook
#          296  the file has no capability rows at all
#          168  the file HAS rows and this call wrote none of them  <- the narrowing working
#           57  the path shape did not resolve
#     excluding the replay artifact: 535 live calls, 14 notices = 2.6%
#
# Fifteen lines across two months is not wallpaper, and the honest reading runs the other way:
# the risk is that it is too RARE to build a habit around. The 500-call artifact class is
# biased toward first full writes, which are the likeliest to fire, so the production rate is
# higher than 2.6% — bounded above by the 88 rows the four corpora hold today, since a row is
# introduced by at least one write. Somewhere between 15 and 88 notices over two months.
# The argument, the bound and the hand-classified false-positive rate are in the record.
#
# ===========================================================================================
# THE THREE DESIGN DECISIONS THAT KEEP IT OFF THE WALL, each forced by a measurement
# ===========================================================================================
# 1. CHECK 4 ONLY. Running the whole of `brief-provenance.py` on a record emits 1633 rows
#    over 64 records — 25.5 per record from checks 1-3. Delivering "the provenance report" on
#    a record write would bury the eight true capability rows under sixteen hundred others.
#    So `check_capability` is called directly. Verified on the six largest documents in the
#    corpus: the row sets from `review()`-filtered and `check_capability()` are identical,
#    and the direct call is 2-4x faster (0.03s on a 160 KB page).
#
# 2. ONLY SENTENCES THIS CALL ACTUALLY WROTE. The hook re-scans the WHOLE file, so a
#    document with N rows edited K times would cost N*K rows. Measured, that is the single
#    largest source of repetition in the corpus. The fix is not a dedupe ledger — it is a
#    narrower and MORE CORRECT question: does the flagged sentence appear in the text THIS
#    call wrote? A row about a paragraph the author did not touch is not about this write.
#    Stateless, and in the replay above it is what keeps 168 of the 1035 calls quiet — every
#    one of them a call that touched a flagged record and wrote none of its flagged lines.
#
#    It also makes reads silent for free: `sed -n '1,50p' record.md` and
#    `git add record.md` name the path and write no sentence, so nothing matches.
#
# 3. A SURFACE LIST DERIVED FROM RATES, NOT FROM INTUITION. Measured rows per document:
#
#        docs/verification/  0.59-0.79    <- 2 of the 4 instances live here
#        wiki/               0.66         <- the durable record; the noisiest, and kept
#        memory/*.md         0.04         <- 1 of the 4 instances; the best precision
#        RICH/CEO-TODOs.md   2.00         <- EXCLUDED, see below
#
#    RICH-TODOs.md and CEO-TODOs.md are excluded on the measurement, not on taste: their
#    whole PURPOSE is to record what is awaited by a person, and rule A1 holds "awaited" to
#    be universally unestablishable. Eight recorded writes to RICH-TODOs.md would each have
#    re-emitted the same four rows — one file accounting for 32 emissions, more than the
#    other three surfaces put together, over rows that are correct about the WORDS and wrong
#    about the DOCUMENT. A page that would be flagged on every write is the wallpaper this
#    was forbidden to become.
#
#    Source files, `fixtures/` and `*.corpus.md` are out by construction: the check reads
#    prose, and a corpus file asserts known-bad sentences ON PURPOSE.
#
# ===========================================================================================
# WHAT IT WILL NOT DO
# ===========================================================================================
#   * IT NEVER BLOCKS AND NEVER FAILS A TOOL CALL — and it never LOOKS like it did either,
#     which took a measurement to get right. It exits 0 on every path and speaks through
#     `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`. The obvious alternative, stderr with exit 2, is
#     what the engine's other PostToolUse reporter uses and is what this hook used first; both
#     were measured in headless sessions and both reach the author, but the host wraps the
#     exit-2 form in "PostToolUse:Write hook BLOCKING ERROR from command". The table is at the
#     emission site. A check that could not run is silent, because it must never look like a
#     failed write.
#   * IT NEVER EDITS THE RECORD. The rows are transient, addressed to the author at the one
#     moment the word can still be changed. 49 of 88 hand-classified rows are sentences that
#     turn out to be fine; a permanent section of those inside a landed record would be noise
#     in the durable record, forever, which is the opposite of what a record is for.
#   * IT DOES NOT COVER THE FOURTH INSTANCE, and this is said plainly rather than implied
#     away: one of the four was a sentence typed straight to the CEO in chat. It passes
#     through no file and no tool. Nothing textual will ever catch it, and this hook does not.
#
# NOTE: hooks are snapshotted at session start, so this is inert until the next session.
