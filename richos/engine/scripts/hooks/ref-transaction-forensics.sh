# ref-transaction-forensics.sh — git `reference-transaction` hook.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# On 2026-09-13 refs/heads/main in /Users/alex/ab/richos moved three times
# leaving an EMPTY reflog message (18:09:09, 18:23:13, 23:41:29). Every other
# entry on that branch carries "merge", "commit", "reset" or "pull". An empty
# message means the ref was written by something that supplied no reflog
# message — plumbing (update-ref with no -m, commit-tree + update-ref), a
# non-git library (libgit2/dulwich), or a direct write to .git/refs/heads/main
# or packed-refs. The reflog records the RESULT and nothing about the writer,
# so the writer was unattributable.
#
# Git invokes `reference-transaction` for EVERY ref write, including plumbing
# and including writes that supply no reflog message. This hook therefore sees
# exactly the class of event that was evading the reflog, and records WHO did
# it: the writing process, its full command line, and its whole parent chain.
#
# CONTRACT (git's, not ours)
#   argv[1]  = transaction state: "prepared" | "committed" | "aborted"
#   stdin    = lines of "<old-oid> SP <new-oid> SP <refname>"
#   exit !=0 during "prepared" ABORTS the transaction and fails the command.
#
# THEREFORE THIS HOOK IS NEVER ALLOWED TO FAIL. It runs without `set -e`, it
# swallows every error, and its last statement is an unconditional `exit 0`.
# A forensic recorder that can break a merge is worse than no recorder.
#
# The log lives OUTSIDE every repository (default
# ~/.claude/state/ref-forensics/) so it survives a reset, a worktree removal,
# a reclone, and anything done to the repository it is watching.
#
# Append-only by construction: one `printf` per ref, `>>` only; the file is
# never truncated, rewritten or rotated by this hook.

# Deliberately NO `set -e` and NO `set -o pipefail`. See above.

    # CAP, and why there is one: a `git commit -m` with a long body puts the
    # whole message on the command line, and Claude Code's shell wrapper puts a
    # ~1.5 kB preamble in front of every command. Uncapped, one ordinary commit
    # wrote ~24 kB to this log. 1000 bytes per command comfortably contains the
    # subcommand, its flags and the refs it names — which is the whole forensic
    # payload — and a truncation is MARKED with the number of bytes dropped, so
    # it can never be mistaken for the end of a command.

    # UNDER THE OPERATOR-FENCE LAUNCHER this hook is not Git's child but the
    # launcher's (scripts/lib/operator-fence-launcher.sh runs its chain as
    # children), so its own parent is the launcher and every row would name
    # "bash .../reference-transaction" as the writer. The launcher hands its own
    # parent, the Git process, down as RICHOS_REF_HOOK_PARENT, and the walk
    # starts there, so a record reads the same with or without the launcher.
