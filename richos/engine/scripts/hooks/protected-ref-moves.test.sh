# protected-ref-moves.test.sh — THE READER FOR A CHECK THAT STOPPED WRITING.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT IS UNDER TEST
# ===========================================================================
#   scripts/lib/protected-ref-moves.py            the predicate
#   scripts/hooks/notice-protected-ref-moves.sh   the Stop notice
#
# On 2026-09-14 the engine's protected-ref check stopped moving a ref back and
# started only reporting. The report went to three places and a person read
# none of them; the third and loudest, a `=== PROTECTED REF MOVED ... ===` line
# from observe-created-refs.sh, goes to the STDERR of a PostToolUse hook that
# exits 0 — measured invisible on the operator's stream in the channel table in
# scripts/lib/stop-hook-notice.sh, and printed into the session of the agent
# that made the move. This suite exists to prove the replacement is audible,
# that it is audible BECAUSE OF ITS CHANNEL, and that it is quiet when it
# should be.
#
# ===========================================================================
# EVERY FIRING CASE HAS A SILENT TWIN, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN
# ===========================================================================
# A notice that always fires and a notice that never fires are both useless and
# both look like a passing suite. So each case here is paired with one built to
# be as similar as possible, with a single fact changed.
#
#   P01/P02  a tip that is OFF the branch fires  <->  the same event row with
#            the tip still ON the branch is silent. This is the pair that
#            matters: P02 is the lead's ordinary land, which is what the old
#            writing check could not tell from abuse, and it must say nothing.
#   P03/P04  a branch that is gone, and a repository that is gone, are each
#            announced as CANNOT BE CHECKED. Undecidable is never collapsed
#            into clear.
#   P05/P06  the same finding twice in one session is announced once  <->  a
#            NEW finding in that same session speaks again.
#   P07/P08  a settlement with a reason silences it  <->  a settlement with a
#            blank reason is refused and silences nothing.
#   P09/P10  the notice announces every way it can stop working: no predicate,
#            and no resolvable root.
#   P11      an unadopted directory is silent — the noise control.
#   P12      THE NEGATIVE CONTROL FOR THE CHANNEL. The same hook, reaching the
#            same finding, announcing the way the OLD surface announces (stderr
#            at exit 0), puts NOTHING on the operator's stream. Without this,
#            P01 proves a message exists and not that anybody can see it.
#   P13      the predicate never writes a ref. Its reachability call is run
#            against a repository whose refs are recorded before and after.
#
# Usage: scripts/hooks/protected-ref-moves.test.sh
# Exit:  0 all cases passed, 1 otherwise.
