# guard-ci-turn-gate.test.sh — THE TURN GATE BITES, AND IT LETS GO.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
# ===========================================================================
# A blocking Stop hook is the most dangerous object this engine ships: get it
# wrong in one direction and a red workflow ends turns for another sixteen
# days; get it wrong in the other and the founder's session cannot be ended at
# all. So both directions are proven here, end to end, through the REAL hook —
# not the analyzer in isolation — because what the founder is promised is that
# he can WATCH it refuse.
#
# The five directions the brief names, each with its own case:
#
#   1. a session that pushed to a repository whose tip run FAILED  -> REFUSED,
#      and the refusal names the repository, the workflow and the URL
#   2. the same with a GREEN tip                                   -> silent, 0
#   3. GitHub unreachable                                          -> allowed,
#      and it says why
#   4. a live `ci-red-ack:` with a real reason                     -> allowed
#      and logged; a BARE marker                                   -> refused
#   5. an endpoint that never answers                              -> control
#      returns INSIDE the budget and the turn is allowed
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE FIXTURE IS A REAL REPOSITORY AND A REAL TRANSCRIPT
# ===========================================================================
# Nothing here is stubbed except GitHub. The sandbox holds an actual git
# repository with an actual `origin` and an actual pushed commit, and the
# session's pushes are read from an actual JSONL transcript of the shape Claude
# Code writes — including the `cd <other-repo> && git push` form, measured from
# this project's own transcripts, where the record's `cwd` is a DIFFERENT
# repository from the one being pushed. A fixture that used the easy form would
# prove the gate works on a command shape this project does not use.
#
# Usage: scripts/hooks/guard-ci-turn-gate.test.sh
# Exit:  0 all cases passed, 1 otherwise.
