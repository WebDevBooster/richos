# guard-unguarded-rm.sh: PreToolUse[Bash] rule (a module of dispatch-pretooluse.sh).
# NEVER LET CLAUDE CODE'S OWN rm CIRCUIT BREAKER ASK THE CEO.
#
# The CEO, 2026-10-02, bypass permissions on, was stopped by a Yes/No prompt from a teammate's
# `rm -f $D/*.jsonl`: "Dangerous rm operation on possibly-empty variable path". The prompt is Claude
# Code's critical-path check (code.claude.com/docs/en/permission-modes#critical-paths), which no allow
# rule and no PreToolUse "allow" can approve, and which bypassPermissions still asks about. A hook that
# DENIES runs before it, so the agent gets the exact rewrite and the CEO never sees a prompt.
#
# The rule and its shapes are in scripts/lib/unguarded_rm.py. It is a text match and leaks; its job is
# to stop the habitual command. Any error in the check is a pass. Suite: guard-unguarded-rm.test.sh.
