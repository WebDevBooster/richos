# release-land-leases.test.sh: the operator fence's turn-end release
# (scripts/hooks/release-land-leases.sh; spec r3 e6, Frank F3 and G5 point 3).
#
#   T1  this session's lease on a repository at rest is released at its turn end,
#       silently
#   T2  a commit not pushed keeps the lease, and one systemMessage says so
#   T3  dirty paths keep it, and the message names them (G5 point 3)
#   T4  a merge in progress keeps it, and the message says so
#   T5  another session's lease is never touched, and nothing is said
#   T6  WITH THE SWITCH OFF a lease file is ignored: no output, nothing touched
#   T7  no leases at all: no output; the hook always exits 0 and its stdout, when
#       there is any, is one JSON object
#
# Usage: scripts/hooks/release-land-leases.test.sh
