# unlanded-branches.test.sh — THE TWO HALVES OF "FINISHED WORK IS NOT ON MAIN".
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT IS UNDER TEST
# ===========================================================================
#   scripts/lib/unlanded-branches.py            the sweep
#   scripts/hooks/notice-unlanded-branches.sh   the Stop notice  (hook 1)
#   scripts/hooks/guard-unresolved-claims.py    the claim class  (hook 2)
#   scripts/unlanded-branches-lint.sh           the same sweep by hand
#
# ===========================================================================
# EVERY CASE HAS ITS OPPOSITE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN
# ===========================================================================
# A hook that ALWAYS fires and a hook that NEVER fires are both useless and both
# look like a passing test. So each firing case here is paired with a silent one
# built to be as similar as possible: same repository, same message, one fact
# changed. If the pair ever agrees, one of them is wrong and the suite says so.
#
#   U02/U03   a stranded branch fires      <-> a merged-in branch is silent
#   U04/U05   a branch a LOCKED worktree holds is silent, and still COUNTED
#   U06       a branch whose commits are on origin/main is silent
#   U07/U08   the cross-repository branch is found; its live twin is not
#   U10/U12   a finding is announced       <-> the same finding, again, is not
#   U13/U14   a NEW finding speaks again   <-> a clean repository says nothing
#   U15..U17  the notice announces every way it can stop working
#   U18..U21  AN ABSTENTION IS NOT A CLEAN RESULT. A repository with no recorded
#             integration branch cannot be answered for at all; it arrived as
#             STATUS partial / N 0 and was printed as "clear again". U19 fires
#             over it, U20 is the same repository with the branch RECORDED (the
#             branch is named), U21 is the same repository read end to end with
#             nothing ahead (the word "clear" is still reachable) — so deleting
#             the word cannot pass this triple.
#   U22       findings AND a gap: both named, and the list called a floor
#   L05       the lint's exit 0 / exit 2 collapse, one layer in from L04
#   C02/C04   a completeness claim over stranded work reports <-> no claim, silent
#   C05       the SAME sentence with nothing stranded is silent
#   C06       a NEGATED completeness claim is silent
#   C07       a QUOTED completeness claim is silent (the 13-point precision fix)
#   C01       it reports and NEVER blocks — exit 0, always
#   L01..L04  the lint script's three exit codes never collapse into each other
#
# THE CASE IDS ARE TWO DIGITS AND CARRY NO SUB-LETTER, and that is a
# correction rather than a style. unlanded-branches.mutation.sh greps
# `FAIL  <id>` as a RAW regex, so an id that is a PREFIX of another matches it:
# with `U3` and `U3b` in the same suite, nine mutants each reported "the red is
# unrelated" while every one of them had turned exactly the right case red. No
# id here is a prefix of any other, and `ok` and `bad` carry the identical id so
# the harness can tell "red for this reason" from "red somewhere else".
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE SANDBOX IS TWO REPOSITORIES, BECAUSE THE COMMON CASE IS TWO
# ===========================================================================
# Measured on this machine on 2026-09-06: every teammate of the live session
# works in `richos` while the session is seated in `femcboost`. A suite with one
# repository would prove the sweep against the case that does not happen.
#
# Usage: scripts/hooks/unlanded-branches.test.sh
# Exit:  0 all cases passed, 1 otherwise.

# 3b. AN ABSTENTION IS NOT A CLEAN RESULT
#
# A repository with no recorded integration branch (point 14) cannot be
# answered for: "has this landed?" has no reference to be asked against, so the
# sweep abstains rather than assuming main. That arrived as STATUS partial /
# N 0, the notice treated `partial` as a no-op, and the zero-findings branch
# printed "UNLANDED-BRANCH WATCH: clear again" over a repository holding an
# unlanded cc/ branch. Neither repository this engine governs has a branch
# recorded, so that was the live state.
#
# THE PAIR IS THE POINT. U19 fires over the abstention; U20 is the same
# repository with the branch RECORDED, where the branch is named instead; U21
# is the same repository with nothing ahead of main, where the word "clear" is
# still reachable. A fix that simply deleted the word would pass U19 alone.
