#
# THE FIXTURES ARE THE REAL STRINGS OF 2026-09-19, not paraphrases. That is the
# whole design of this suite: the guard exists because of specific commands and
# specific sentences, some of which must be refused and some of which must
# pass, and a synthetic fixture cannot tell you which side of that line a
# change lands on. Every quoted block below is copied from the transcript,
# brief or record named above it.
#
# Covered here:
#
#   (a) REFUSES the two `pmset displaysleepnow` calls zach-opus-testvm1 made at
#       18:51:27Z and 18:51:31Z, verbatim, including the multi-line one whose
#       OTHER pmset — `pmset -g powerstate` — must not be what fires;
#   (b) REFUSES the Command-Q that reached the CEO's Terminal at 18:10Z, in the
#       brief's short form AND in the real form addressed at a unix id;
#   (c) REFUSES `sudo pmset sleepnow` and `caffeinate -dimsu`, and PASSES
#       `pmset -g`, `caffeinate -is <cmd>`, and `kill -TERM <pid>` — the last
#       because it is the PRESCRIBED remedy and a guard that catches the remedy
#       gets waived;
#   (d) GUEST BY CONSTRUCTION: `ssh <host> '<host-changing command>'` and
#       `testvm/ax.sh <vm> '<applescript>'` pass;
#   (e) NEGATIVE CONTROLS — six host commands wrapped to LOOK guest-bound. A
#       command after an ssh segment, inside `bash -c`, behind an ssh-shaped
#       environment assignment, in a command substitution, behind a launcher
#       merely NAMED like ssh, and in an `ssh -o ProxyCommand=` (which runs
#       LOCALLY). All refused;
#   (f) PROSE: the real 18:38:49Z SendMessage and the real 2026-09-18 brief
#       line are REFUSED; ceo-decisions §65 PASSES ON MERIT, with no path
#       exemption, because a guard that forbids the record of what it forbids
#       is the shape that cost this engine fourteen vendored lines in 2026-08;
#   (g) HEREDOCS ARE DOCUMENTS: `cat > note.md <<EOF` carrying the memory note
#       that BANS the Command-Q passes, and `cat > run.sh <<EOF` carrying a
#       script that RUNS it does not;
#   (h) THE HATCH IS A CITATION: a resolving `ceo-ruled-host-power:` line
#       permits and is LOGGED; a bare marker, a section with no quotation, and
#       a citation of a section NOT in the record each exempt nothing;
#   (i) FAIL OPEN: unparseable payload, another tool, an unadopted repository
#       and a declared off switch all allow — the first loudly, the rest silent;
#   (j) the self-exemption is by BASENAME and covers exactly four files;
#   (k) the one hard refusal: a missing scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh prints the
#       shared BROKEN INSTALL banner and exits 2.
#
# Run directly: scripts/hooks/guard-host-display-power.test.sh
# Exit 0 = all cases pass; exit 1 = at least one failure.

## §64 — Urban's re-walk is off fix-only nightly rounds (2026-09-19)

Body.

## §65 — No agent touches this Mac's display, sleep, lock or session state (2026-09-19)

**What happened.** To prove the new test VM survives a locked host, Rich wrote `pmset displaysleepnow` into a teammate's instructions as an option. The teammate ran it on the CEO's Mac, at least three times, while he was at the machine. His words, 19:10Z: *"So, this is why all of the monitors went black and there was no way for me to switch them back on? I'm lucky that locking the screen with the keyboard button worked and that unlocking brought back the screens on. But a horrible fucking experience that! I was already considering killing the Mac with the power button!"* The same day a teammate's Command-Q keystroke through System Events landed on his Terminal and offered to terminate the session.

**The rule, Rich's, recorded here because it reached him physically.** No agent, and no brief, message or script Rich writes, changes this Mac's display, sleep, lock, session or input state: no `pmset` other than `pmset -g`, no `caffeinate -d`/`-u`, no lock or sleep through osascript, no keystroke with a modifier to the host, no `shutdown`/`reboot`/`killall loginwindow`. Such state changes only inside a test VM over ssh. A "locked host" proof is done by asking him to lock it himself, or not done.

**Mechanism.** `guard-host-display-power.sh` in the engine (PreToolUse on Bash, Agent and brief writes), tested by defeat with the real strings from the day, enforcing from the next session. The only exemption is a `ceo-ruled-host-power:` line quoting a section of this file.

Two acceptance items added, from the CEO's question "so the Mac screen won't need to be kept unlocked after that?": (1) the completion proof (run.sh -> frame -> AX read -> stop.sh) must be captured while the HOST's screen is locked (`pmset displaysleepnow` or the lock shortcut via the CEO - if you cannot lock it yourself without a keystroke, say so and I will ask him to lock it for the test); the guest's own screensaver/lock is off and stays off. (2) The VM host process runs under `caffeinate -dimsu` (or equivalent) so a locked-but-awake Mac never pauses the VM; document in `docs/testvm.md` that locked is fine and sleep pauses everything.
FIX

# richos-hq/docs/briefs/echo-brief-wait-for-screen-unlock-2026-09-18.md, the
# block containing line 47. Written the day BEFORE §65 — the rule is right and
# the document predates it. Note the block also says "only if no candidate is
# on screen", about something else: without the permissive-construction veto
# that `no` exempts the whole item.
read -r -d '' BRIEF_0918 <<'FIX' || true
   `cargo test -p richos-core`, `cargo check` in `src-tauri`, the UI runner if a timeline line or
   status chip changes (registry row + affordance check), `gui-boot.test.sh` only if no candidate is
   on screen. Paste the tails. Dated record under `docs/verification/` with a real lock/unlock walk on
   this Mac (you may lock the screen with `pmset displaysleepnow` only when Rich says the screen is
   free - ask first; a walk is on it now).

On 2026-09-19 ~18:10Z echo-opus-offer2 quit its on-screen proof instance with `osascript ... keystroke "q" using command down`. The app was not frontmost; the keystroke went to the CEO's Terminal.

**How to apply:** quit by process id only (`kill -TERM <pid>`); never any key with `command down` through System Events.
