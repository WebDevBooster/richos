"""Preserve ordinary Bash command failures before output filters can hide them.

PreToolUse preserves failure propagation and records subagent ownership. Subagent
CLI commands opt into a six-second foreground grace and native handoff; wait
calls remain foreground and explicit background calls remain background. Held
calls are denied. No shell parsing, command execution or auto-approval.
Expected failures belong in explicit if/else or || branches. This covers the
calling shell; scripts and explicit failure handling retain their own semantics.
