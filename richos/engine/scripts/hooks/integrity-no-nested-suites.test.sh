# integrity-no-nested-suites.test.sh — the integrity suite does not run other
# suites inside itself.
#
# The finding (hunt 2026-09-29 part 3, number 10): contract-integrity.test.sh ran
# nine complete suites as cases of its own (definition drift, workspace registry,
# workspace end-to-end, interactive prompt, idle land, claims, resume isolation,
# stated actions, scratch reaper). Each had been added when nothing else ran that
# suite. Now scripts/run-all-tests.sh and scripts/ci-units.sh discover every
# *.test.sh and run each as its own unit, so the nested run repeated work a unit
# already does, inside the suite that is the longest unit of a full pass. What
# the integrity suite can still say that the runner cannot is that the suite IS
# on the runner's list, and that is what remains (suite_discovered).
#
#   N1  none of the nine suites is executed from contract-integrity.test.sh
#   N2  each of the nine is still asserted present on the runner's list
#   N3  by execution: a scoped run of the scratch-reaper section passes its
#       discovery case (the section is cheap; it used to run a whole suite)
#
# Run directly: scripts/hooks/integrity-no-nested-suites.test.sh
# Exit 0 = all cases pass; exit 1 = at least one failure.
