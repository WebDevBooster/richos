#
# THE FIXTURES ARE THE REAL TEXTS OF 2026-09-19, not paraphrases of them. The
# guard exists because of four specific documents — two that must be refused
# and two that must pass — and a synthetic fixture cannot tell you which side
# of that line a change lands on. Every quoted block below is copied from the
# file named above it.
#
# Covered here:
#
#   (a) REFUSES the two phone briefs the CEO's §66 is about, as committed:
#       echo-brief-phone-delivery-30s-paired-wording-keychain-2026-09-19.md,
#       whose Scope names richos/web/web-app/lib/link.js, and
#       echo-brief-phone-to-mac-same-paint-and-pairing-sheet-fold-2026-09-19.md,
#       whose Scope names app/ui/phone.js and whose text carries the transport
#       word that makes a weak path count;
#   (b) PASSES both of them the moment a live `reference:` line is added;
#   (c) PASSES ray-brief-phone-path-in-the-vm-nightly-7-2026-09-19.md — a QA
#       walk over the same surface, which reads it rather than building on it;
#   (d) PASSES reed-brief-t3code-tooling-adoption-read-2026-09-19.md — the
#       research read that COMMISSIONED the ledger, and the densest
#       signal-carrying document in the whole corpus;
#   (e) THE HATCH IS A CITATION OR AN ARGUED ABSENCE: a bare `reference:`
#       exempts nothing; a line naming no section, or no ledger, or a section
#       that is NOT in the ledger, each exempt nothing and are refused BY NAME;
#       a `reference: none — <40+ characters>` passes and is LOGGED to
#       .claude/state/reference-none.log; an accepted citation is logged to
#       reference-ledger-acks.log with section=verified or section=unverified;
#   (f) THE WEAK-PATH RULE, both directions: a brief whose Scope names
#       app/ui/phone.js and whose text carries NO transport word passes, and
#       the same text with one carries a refusal. This is the narrowing that
#       took the measured fires from 32 to 11;
#   (g) THE READ VETO IS QUANTIFIED, both directions: "you do not touch the
#       host keychain" does NOT exempt a build brief, and "do not modify
#       anything under richos/app" does;
#   (h) FAIL OPEN: an unparseable payload, a call for another tool, a
#       repository that never adopted the engine, a declared off switch, and a
#       missing surfaces file all allow — the first and last loudly;
#   (i) the one hard refusal: a missing scripts/lib/resolve-roots.sh prints the
#       shared BROKEN INSTALL banner and exits 2.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE MEASUREMENT, REPRODUCIBLE
# ===========================================================================
# Before this guard was wired, every brief in richos-hq/docs/briefs and every
# spawn prompt in the ordering session's scratchpad — 302 documents — were
# driven through THIS FILE'S SUBJECT as real Agent payloads. ELEVEN fired.
#
#   echo-brief-phone-delivery-30s-paired-wording-keychain-2026-09-19.md  §2.6
#   echo-brief-phone-to-mac-same-paint-and-pairing-sheet-fold-2026-09-19.md §2.6
#   echo-brief-the-chosen-route-reaches-the-backend-2026-09-19.md        §2.6
#   echo-brief-nightly-gate-env-isolation-2026-09-17.md                  §2.1
#   zach-brief-candidate-build-time-2026-09-19.md                        §2.1
#   zach-brief-guard-reference-ledger-2026-09-19.md            §2.1 §2.4 §2.6
#   spawn-pl2.prompt.md, spawn-pl3.prompt.md, spawn-echo-opus-route1.prompt.md,
#   spawn-zb.prompt.md, spawn-rg.prompt.md      (the spawn prompts of the above)
#
# NINE of the eleven are build dispatches onto a ledger surface — the two phone
# briefs, the route brief that changes the phone backend, and two briefs that
# change what the nightly's signing and notarization steps receive. The other
# TWO are this guard's own brief and its spawn prompt, which enumerate the
# signal words inside a `## What to build` section; they carry the argued
# `reference: none` that brief itself prescribes, and that is the designed
# answer rather than a miss.
#
# THE NARROWINGS THAT PRODUCED THAT NUMBER, each measured and each reversible
# by a mutant in reference-ledger.mutation.sh:
#
#   32 -> 11   weak paths. `ui/phone.js` as a STRONG path fired on 13 phone
#              briefs of 2026-09-19; twelve were about button focus, scroll
#              position and splash placement, and carried no transport word
#              anywhere. Exactly one did, and it is the one §66 is about.
#   a refusal recovered   the read veto needs a universal quantifier. A bare
#              "do not touch" passed the delivery brief, which says "you do not
#              touch the host keychain" about one file while commissioning
#              changes to six others.
#   a refusal recovered   a bare `read-only` is not a read. The same brief says
#              "(Rich read 6 attribute lines for that service, read-only;
#              nothing deleted)".
#
# Reproduce before changing any pattern: build an Agent payload per document
# and pipe it into the guard. The classifier is the guard's own python3 block,
# so the measurement is of the shipped rule and not of a model of it.
#
# Run directly: scripts/hooks/guard-reference-ledger.test.sh
# Exit 0 = all cases pass; exit 1 = at least one failure.

# Title, the item that names the transport, the two sentences that defeated an
# unquantified read veto, and the Scope section verbatim.
read -r -d '' DELIVERY <<'FIX' || true
# Brief: a phone message takes 30–55 s to reach the Mac and one in four never arrives; the Mac says "It is paired" before the person confirms the six words

1. **BLOCKING — delivery.** Four phone sends; send → Mac intake (from the Mac's own intake log): 30.67 s, 54.47 s, 48.79 s, and one **never arrived**. Every delay is ≥ 30 s with a backoff's spread; `richos/web/web-app/lib/link.js:66` `MAX_RETRY_MS = 30000`, `:83` `opts.maxRetryMs`.
4. **MEDIUM (harness) — the CEO's real keychain.** Candidates .14–.16 ran on the host with those homes (Rich read 6 attribute lines for that service, read-only; nothing deleted). Make the service name derive from the app-data directory so a scratch `HOME` can never collide with the real app's item; Rich decides whether to remove them; you do not touch the host keychain.

## Scope

`richos/web/web-app/lib/link.js` and the phone page's send path, `richos/app/src-tauri/src/phone/{listen.rs,secrets.rs,ca.rs,mod.rs}`, `richos/app/ui/phone.js` (+ `style.css` if wording needs it), tests: `second-mouth.js`, `phone.js`, `settings-fit.js`.

## Completion criterion

- Item 1's cause named (file:function), red/green in the harness.
FIX

# richos-hq/docs/briefs/echo-brief-phone-to-mac-same-paint-and-pairing-sheet-fold-2026-09-19.md
# The Scope section names app/ui/phone.js — a WEAK path — and item 1 carries
# the transport word "intake" that makes it count.
read -r -d '' SAMEPAINT <<'FIX' || true
# Brief: a phone-typed message still reaches the Mac's open thread in the same paint as its reply (7.3 s)

1. **R3, phone → Mac, STILL THERE and worse than .13 (5.68 s): 7,288 ms.** Find where the thread view drops or defers the intake-borne `CeoMessage` — the open-thread render path, a "same thread already open" guard, a batch-until-turn-settles rule, or the event never carrying the open thread's id — and fix it at the cause.

## Scope and files

`app/ui/phone.js`, `app/ui/phone.css` (or wherever the pairing sheet's styles live — find them), the thread-render path in `app/ui/main.js` OUTSIDE offer2's region, `app/crates/richos-core/src/spine.rs` / `live.rs` only if the event is the cause, `app/ui/tests/settings-fit.js`.

## Completion criterion

- Each of the three reproduced red on `f247c535` in the harness, green on your branch.
FIX

# THE SAME BRIEF WITH ITS TRANSPORT WORD REMOVED — the twelve phone briefs of
# 2026-09-19 that name app/ui/phone.js and are about focus, scroll and splash
# placement all look like this, and all twelve must pass.
read -r -d '' PHONEUI <<'FIX' || true
# Brief: the composer's buttons sit off the baseline and the Settings button loses focus on Escape

1. **The composer's two buttons are 3 px below the input's baseline at every window width.** Fix it in the stylesheet, not with a margin on one button.

## Scope and files

`app/ui/phone.js`, `app/ui/phone.css`, `app/ui/style.css`, `app/ui/tests/settings-fit.js`, `app/ui/tests/lib/state-registry.js`.

## Completion criterion

- Red on `f247c535` in the harness, green on your branch; both themes, AA computed.
FIX

# richos-hq/docs/briefs/ray-brief-phone-path-in-the-vm-nightly-7-2026-09-19.md
# A QA walk over exactly the surface the delivery brief builds on. No build
# heading, and a "Do not" section that says it fixes nothing.
read -r -d '' RAYWALK <<'FIX' || true
# Brief: walk the phone path on nightly .7 inside the test VM — pairing, both sides, phone → Mac in one paint or not

## The walk, in order

4. **R3, phone → Mac.** In the guest, with the same thread open in the app: type a message in the phone page and send; capture the app window at ~45 ms intervals from the send; report the ms until the user bubble appears in the open thread. `richos/web/web-app/lib/link.js` is the phone page's send path.

## Deliverable

`docs/verification/2026-09-19-nightly-7-phone-path-in-the-vm-audit.md` in richos — verdict first, then a row per item with FIXED / STILL THERE / NOT REACHED and the measurement.

## Do not

Do not launch anything on the host. Do not fix anything; record it. No new dependency.
FIX

# richos-hq/docs/briefs/reed-brief-t3code-tooling-adoption-read-2026-09-19.md
# The read that COMMISSIONED the ledger. It names every area the ledger has,
# under a heading that is scope-shaped, and it must obviously pass.
read -r -d '' REEDREAD <<'FIX' || true
# Brief: read T3 Code's build, test, release, update and harness tooling in full, and say what RichOS can adopt instead of build

Our stack: Rust + Tauri 2 desktop app (`richos/app`), a WebKit-Playwright ui harness, `richos/app/scripts/nightly-local.py` for build/sign/notarize/publish to GitHub releases, `richos-user-update` crate for updates.

## What to deliver — a committed brief in your worktree, `docs/research/t3code-tooling-what-to-adopt-2026-09-19.md`

1. **Per area, one of three verdicts with the file:line evidence:** ADOPT AS-IS, COPY THE APPROACH, NOT APPLICABLE. Areas: build/sign/notarize/publish; update channel and rollback; test harness and screenshot stability; release gating; developer loop; crash/reconnect; anything else you find that we hand-built (compare against `richos/app/scripts/` and `richos/app/ui/tests/lib/`).

Read in full; every claim carries a `t3code:<path>:<line>`. Commit, SHA in the handoff. Delete the clone. Do not modify anything under `richos/app`.

# Brief: the sidebar's Running row does not clear its activity dot when a turn ends

## Scope and files
