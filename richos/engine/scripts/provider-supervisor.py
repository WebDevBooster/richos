# REAPING MODE: `--reap-descendants` (spec r3 (q) item 2, F5; Frank G8, G9; and
# the product reap, richos-hq docs/plans/2026-09-27-product-reap-gap-design.md)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# main() above is the COMPATIBILITY path: byte-identical and at the same lines
# as before this section existed (other files cite its line numbers), and it is
# what runs when no option is given. Both callers that ship now run the section
# below: the operator's leads (`operator_profile.rs`) and, since the product reap
# gap design, every product lease (`native.rs`, design 1.3(a)).
#
# OPTIONS. Every leading argument that starts with `--reap-` is this
# supervisor's own and is STRIPPED before `execvp`, so the provider's argv and
# environment are exactly what main() would have given it (design C7, R11):
#   --reap-descendants      reaping mode (required by the three below)
#   --reap-grace=SECONDS    how long the provider gets after SIGTERM; 0 = none
#   --reap-state=PATH       the host's snapshot file (below)
#   --reap-log=PATH         where kills and failures are written
# The operator passes only the first and keeps its environment names
# (OPERATOR_REAP_GRACE, RICHOS_OPERATOR_REAP_STATE, RICHOS_OPERATOR_REAP_LOG),
# which stay the fallback. The product passes all four on the command line, so
# nothing of the reap reaches `claude`'s environment or any tool shell's.
#
# WHY. A tool shell of a Claude lead runs in its OWN session and process group
# (measured: shell pid = pgid, tty `??`), so the final `killpg` of this group
# never reaches it. With the flag, this supervisor reads the process table IN
# PROCESS once a second (libproc on macOS, /proc on Linux; never by spawning
# `ps`) and records every descendant of the provider as (pid, start time, pgid),
# and every process group a descendant belongs to. Those are processes its own
# child created: owned, never matched by name. An entry is forgotten once its
# process is gone, and a group once it is no longer proven ours, so the record
# holds what is alive rather than everything a long lease ever ran (design C4).
#
# WHEN THE PROVIDER MUST END (the desktop died, a SIGTERM arrived, or the
# provider exited by itself, G9): a final snapshot, then the provider is ended:
# with a grace above zero, SIGTERM and a wait of up to that many seconds
# (operator default 5); with a grace of zero (the product), SIGKILL at once to
# the provider, which is this process's own unreaped child and so cannot be a
# recycled id (design C3). Then SIGKILL to every recorded group that still has a
# recorded member alive or whose leader still has its recorded start time, and
# to every recorded descendant still alive outside those groups, checked by
# start time so a recycled id is never signaled. It re-scans and repeats, at
# most three passes, then ends its own group exactly as main() does. Every kill,
# anything found alive after the last pass, and a reap that failed goes to the
# reap log (--reap-log, else RICHOS_OPERATOR_REAP_LOG, else stderr).
#
# THE HOST NEVER SIGKILLS THIS GROUP FIRST. A SIGKILL cannot be caught, so a
# host that killed this group would end the reap before it began and leave the
# tool shells running (design C1, R9). The product host sends SIGTERM to this
# process alone and escalates to the group only after a bound
# (`OwnedChild::supervised`, owned_process.rs).
#
# FOR THE HOST'S IDLE TEST (G8) AND THE PRODUCT'S WORK READING (design C5):
# with a state path, each snapshot writes {"owner": <the desktop's pid>,
# "outside_provider_group": [pid, ...], "outside_provider_groups": [pgid, ...]}:
# descendants alive OUTSIDE the provider's own group, and their distinct groups
# (one per running command). Language servers, MCP servers and caffeinate share
# the provider's group and do not count; tool shells and background commands
# have their own groups and do.
#
# THE LIMIT, STATED: a process that detaches itself and starts children, all
# inside the second between two snapshots, can leave those children. A shared
# daemon a lead started (the `adb` server) is killed with that lead. A VM guest a
# lead started is killed mid-boot; its clone on disk is left for the scratch
# reaper (Frank §3).
