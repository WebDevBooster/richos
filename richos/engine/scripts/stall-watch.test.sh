# stall-watch.test.sh: THE STALL WATCHER (scripts/stall-watch.sh running
# scripts/lib/stall_watch.py), PROVEN ON REAL SLOT HOLDERS, REAL
# WAITERS AND A FIXTURE TEAMMATE REGISTRY. Never the operator's
# ~/.richos-nightly slots, ~/.richos-waits, registry, transcripts or ledger.
#
# The CEO, 2026-09-28: "WHERE THE FUCK WAS THAT FUCKING WATCHER BEFORE???"
# Every case below fails on a checkout without scripts/stall-watch.sh.
#
#   S01  a proof-run slot wait over 10 min by one teammate behind another is
#        told ONCE: the waiter, "proof-run slot", its place in line, the
#        holder's name and pid, since when, the Mac's CPU, and `set 2`
#   S02  the next look says nothing (not repeated)
#   S03  after the repeat interval it is told once more, marked as still going
#   S04  the look after that says nothing again
#   S05  at 95% CPU the action is to reorder, not `set 2`
#   S06  the waiter ends: one miss clears nothing, the second look prints ONE
#        STALL-CLEARED line, and the third look says nothing
#   X01  a teammate waiting on a proof-run slot its OWN other process holds is
#        a SELF-WAIT at 3 minutes (never a plain WAIT), naming both pids
#   X02  not repeated
#   X03  cleared once when it ends
#   X04  two DIFFERENT teammates at 3 minutes: nothing is said at all
#   X05  ownership read from the inherited owner tag (agent_hold.py's
#        RICHOS_AGENT_OWNER), through the registry to the teammate's name,
#        though the two records carry different waiter names
#   X06  a holder that is the waiter's own ancestor is a DEADLOCK
#   W01  a test VM wait and a device wait over 10 min: one block, two stalls,
#        who holds each ("no holder recorded" / "not recorded by the waiter")
#   T01  a live teammate with no commit and no transcript write for 25 min is
#        SILENT: its name, last commit, last transcript write, what to do
#   T02  not repeated
#   T03  it writes its transcript: cleared after two looks, once
#   L01-L03  slow steps: three agent_hold.py wait steps 4.5 min apart are told once (name,
#        median, slowest command, since); 10-min run-tests.sh steps are exempt; clears once
#   T04  a long honest run (transcript written 5 min ago, no commit for an
#        hour), a paused teammate and a finished one: none is SILENT
#   E01  THE 2026-10-01 INCIDENT: a teammate of this session raises a proceeding,
#        for=lead escalation after the session started; the next look prints
#        ONE ESCALATION-WATCH block, FIRST, with its key, sender and question
#   E02  told once (paired with E01's print)   E03  a restarted --monitor is silent
#   E04  one in the SessionStart block, one raised after: only the second
#   E04b a SessionStart backlog over the host cap does not wake; a new one does
#   E05  an acked one is never told; an ack ends it with no cleared line
#   E06  stopped: again at 30 min, not at 29
#   E07  needs=ceo-hands: first under NEEDS THE CEO AT A DEVICE, again at 10 min
#   E08  another live session's teammate: not told; owner unknown: told;
#        E08b that session ends: told here
#   E09  proceeding: no 30-min clock, once more at the 1h bucket
#   E10  END TO END: --monitor tells it once over several looks
#   E11  an ack whose --until passes: told again under its reopened key
#   E12  an unreadable ledger: NOT READ, and nothing re-announced after
#   E13  one the Stop hook already delivered this session is not told
#   E14  the lead's transcript is found by session id (the real locator)
#   M01  END TO END: --monitor (the plugin monitor's command) on the fixture
#        prints the stall once over several looks, --alive says watching,
#        a second --monitor for the same session stands down, nothing it
#        watched was touched, and it ends with its session
#   M02  --alive with nothing watching: NOT WATCHED, exit 1
#   M03  --monitor in a repository that never adopted the engine: silent, 0
#   N01  the SessionStart hook: additionalContext only (no systemMessage),
#        names --monitor and the one-line --alive check, says it only reports
#   N02  the hook is silent where the engine was never adopted
#   N03  monitors.json starts `stall-watch.sh --monitor` always, and hooks.json
#        registers session-start-stall.sh once, under SessionStart
#
# Exit 0 = every case passed; exit 1 = at least one failed.
