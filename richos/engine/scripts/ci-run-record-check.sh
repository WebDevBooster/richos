# ci-run-record-check.sh — refuse a commit that has NO run record at all.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR: ABSENCE READS AS SUCCESS
# ===========================================================================
# Every other check in this engine asks "did the verification pass?". This one
# asks the question nothing else asks: "did the verification HAPPEN?"
#
# They are not the same question, and the difference is not theoretical here.
# GitHub Free allows 20 concurrent jobs ACCOUNT-WIDE — shared, in this account,
# with six other active workflows — and per GitHub's own documentation a run
# that exceeds the limit is DROPPED rather than queued. A dropped run leaves NO
# RECORD: no red cross, no yellow dot, no entry in `gh run list`. It leaves the
# commit exactly as it looked before anyone pushed it.
#
# So every tool that answers "is main green?" by looking up the LATEST run
# answers with the previous commit's result. A dropped run is not reported as a
# failure; it is reported as the last success, forever, and the more shards a
# workflow declares the likelier it is to be the workflow that gets dropped.
# The engine's own workflow spent 2026-08-30 to 2026-09-01 completing in three
# seconds with a billing error, and that at least produced twelve red crosses.
# This failure mode produces nothing to look at.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT IT COMPARES, AND WHY PUSH EVENTS RATHER THAN COMMITS
# ===========================================================================
# A workflow with `on: push` runs once per PUSH, against the pushed HEAD — not
# once per commit. So "every commit has a run" is a FALSE requirement: five
# commits pushed together correctly produce one run, and a check built on the
# commit list would cry wolf on every batch and be switched off within a week.
#
# The exact object is the push. `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/events` carries
# PushEvent entries with the head SHA of each push, for public repositories,
# for 90 days. Every push to the watched branch must have a run of the watched
# workflow whose `head_sha` is that push's head. A push with no such run is a
# DROPPED RUN, named with the command that re-dispatches it.
#
# WHEN THE EVENT FEED CANNOT BE READ, the check degrades to a strictly weaker
# but still true predicate — THE BRANCH TIP MUST HAVE A RUN — and says out loud
# which predicate it used. It never degrades to silence: a run-record check that
# cannot read its sources and exits 0 is the very defect it is here to catch.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE RUN WINDOW MUST OUT-REACH THE PUSH WINDOW — 2026-09-14
# ===========================================================================
# THIS CHECK'S FIRST REAL FINDING WAS ITS OWN BUG, and it was the same bug it
# exists to catch, pointed the other way: a bounded window reported as a fact
# about the world.
#
# It read ONE page of the runs API (`per_page=100`) and compared it against one
# page of the event feed. Those two pages do not cover the same span of time.
# On 2026-09-14 the feed carried 70 pushes reaching back to 2026-09-10T06:38Z,
# while `total_count` for engine-self-verify.yml was 207 and the hundred runs
# fetched reached back only to 2026-09-10T07:09Z. Every push in the half hour
# between was reported as HAVING NO RUN AT ALL. Both did have runs:
#
#   0fb68b7c  run #101  event=push  conclusion=success   2026-09-10T06:38:25Z
#   de6ca1f8  run #107  event=push  conclusion=FAILURE   2026-09-10T07:07:13Z
#
#   (gh api repos/WebDevBooster/richos/actions/runs/34446109882 ; .../34448386082)
#
# Both sat on page 2, which nothing ever asked for. The check was not detecting
# dropped runs; it was reporting the edge of its own pagination.
#
# THE SECOND HALF IS WHY THIS IS NOT A COSMETIC FIX. The printed remedy for a
# permanent gap is "move --since past it and say why". Taking that advice here
# would have moved the window past de6ca1f8 — a run that exists and FAILED —
# and buried a real red behind a sentence explaining that nothing was at risk.
# A false MISSING does not merely waste a turn: it recruits the operator into
# hiding evidence.
#
# THE RULE THAT REPLACES THE ASSUMPTION: a MISSING verdict is a claim that no
# run exists, and it is only sayable where the run list PROVABLY covers the
# push. Proof is one of two things, and both are cheap:
#
#   (a) the run list was exhausted — every run the workflow has ever had was
#       fetched, so absence from it is absence, full stop; or
#   (b) the push is NEWER than the oldest run fetched — had a run existed for
#       it, it would have been inside the window by construction.
#
# A push that satisfies neither is UNCOVERED, not missing. It is named, it is
# not counted as a finding, and it exits 2 — the same exit as any other source
# that could not be read, because that is exactly what it is. The alternative,
# which is what shipped, is a check that answers a question it never asked.
#
# So the fetch now PAGES until it runs out of runs or hits --max-pages, and the
# comparison is handed the coverage floor rather than trusting the page.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE GRACE PERIOD IS NOT A FUDGE
# ===========================================================================
# A push made 30 seconds ago has a run that has not appeared in the API yet.
# Failing on it would make this check red on every run, so a push newer than
# --grace-minutes is reported as PENDING and does not fail. That window is the
# only tolerance here, it is stated on every run, and it is deliberately short:
# the dropped-run failure this catches is permanent, so waiting 20 minutes to
# be sure costs nothing and a longer window buys nothing.
#
# Usage:
#   ci-run-record-check.sh --repo <owner/name> --workflow <file.yml>
#                          [--branch main] [--grace-minutes 20] [--limit 100]
#                          [--max-pages 10]
#                          [--since YYYY-MM-DD | YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ]
#
#   --max-pages bounds the run-list paging. It exists so a repository with
#   thousands of runs cannot turn one scheduled check into fifty API calls; it
#   is NOT a correctness knob, because falling short of the end of the list
#   makes pushes UNCOVERED rather than missing. Ten pages is a thousand runs.
#
#   --since is the moment the `push:` trigger was restored — a full timestamp,
#   because a day is the wrong grain: on 2026-09-10 the restoring commit is
#   00:46Z and the first run it produced is 04:11Z, and the seven pushes in
#   between have no run and never can (round 14). Pushes before it correctly
#   have no run and are counted, named in one line, and not failed on —
#   without it this check is red on its first execution over 95 historical
#   pushes, and a check that is red on arrival is a check nobody reads.
#
#   Offline / testing — every source can be supplied as a file, so the logic is
#   testable without a network and without a token:
#       --events-json <f>   the /events payload
#       --runs-json <f>     the workflow-runs payload
#       --tip <sha>         the branch tip, when events are unavailable
#       --runs-complete     assert the supplied runs payload is the WHOLE run
#                           list. Without it a supplied payload is treated as a
#                           window, which is what a file handed in from outside
#                           actually is.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every push in the window has a run record (pending ones are named)
#   1  at least one push has NO run record — each is named
#   2  no answer was reached for part or all of the window — the sources could
#      not be read, or the run list did not provably cover a push. NEVER silent.
