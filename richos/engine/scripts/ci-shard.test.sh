# ci-shard.test.sh — the verdict rules, and the coverage proof, by execution.
#
# EVERY CASE HERE RUNS AGAINST A SYNTHETIC ENGINE built in a sandbox, not
# against this tree. That is deliberate: the properties being proven are about
# a shard that runs FEWER units than it was given, a section whose scoping
# stopped applying, a known-red entry that outlived its defect. None of those
# can be arranged in the real tree without breaking it, and a property that can
# only be proven by breaking production is a property nobody proves.
#
# WHAT IS PROVEN:
#
#   S1   A suite unit is green at exit 0.
#   S2   A SECTION unit is green at exit 3, which is that suite's deliberate
#        scoped-green code.
#   S3   A section unit that exits 0 is a FAILURE, reported as SCOPE-LOST. Exit
#        0 from a scoped invocation means the --only selector did not apply, so
#        the unit ran something other than what its id says — the one thing a
#        scoped run must never be able to claim.
#   S4   An empty selection is REFUSED (exit 2) unless --allow-empty is given.
#        A shard that verifies nothing must never exit 0.
#   S5   A unit id that is not in the inventory is fatal, not skipped.
#   S6   KNOWN-RED: a declared failing unit does not fail the job, and its
#        expiry and reason are printed.
#   S7   THE NEGATIVE CONTROL: a declared unit that PASSES fails the job. Without
#        this the table outlives its defects and becomes a permanent skip list.
#   S8   An entry past its expiry fails the job even while still failing.
#   S9   A receipt is written per unit, carrying the unit id, the verdict, the
#        duration and the COMMIT.
#   S10  --verify-receipts passes when the receipts union to the plan.
#   S11  --verify-receipts FAILS and NAMES the unit when one is missing — the
#        dropped-shard case, which is the whole reason receipts exist.
#   S12  --verify-receipts FAILS when the receipts carry two different commits.
#   S13  --verify-receipts FAILS when a unit has two receipts.
#   S14  --verify-receipts FAILS on an empty receipt set rather than certifying
#        a plan against nothing.
#   S18  A CONDITIONAL known-red row applies only where its predicate holds. In
#        force it behaves as S6; dormant, the unit is judged NORMALLY — rule 2
#        included, so a host without the defect still gets a real verdict rather
#        than a tolerated one. A predicate that cannot be evaluated is treated as
#        APPLYING and says so, because failing open would rebuild the skip list
#        one broken expression at a time.
#   S16  --units-file WITH --shard packs that set and runs shard i of it. This
#        is the affected gate on a large diff: this work's own first push
#        selected 54 units costing ~100 minutes serial, which would have been
#        killed at the job's 60-minute timeout.
#   S17  --verify-receipts --units-file certifies the RESTRICTED plan, and the
#        same receipts checked against the WHOLE inventory correctly FAIL. Both
#        directions, because a coverage check that passes against any plan
#        certifies nothing.
#   S15  A unit that writes outside its sandbox is caught and named, so the
#        leak canary is not lost by sharding. This is the 2026-09-05
#        escalations.test.sh finding, which run-all-tests.sh catches per suite;
#        splitting the pass must not silently drop it.
#   S15b-S15h  THE RECORD CANARY COUNTS ONLY THE UNIT'S OWN WRITES. Each unit
#        runs with HOME in a throwaway home and every variable pointing into
#        the operator's record removed, and the canary watches the record in
#        that home. Positive controls: a write
#        through CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, through $HOME alone and through the
#        workspace registry are each RED and named (S15b-d), and none reaches
#        the operator's record (S15b'). The 2026-09-27 defect: a clean unit
#        PASSES while another process writes the live record during it (S15e).
#        The unit gets no road back (S15f), keeps a git identity (S15g), and a
#        unit that builds a world of its own keeps the resolution it chose (S15h).
#        Codex's reproduction 337: a unit whose only act is scratch_new/release
#        creates its first scratch ledger in its own home, never in the
#        operator's config/state (S15i).
#   S24  A STOPPED RUN NEVER DELETES ITS OWN FOLDER UNDER ITS UNIT (2026-10-02).
#        The merge gate's stop reached ci-shard.sh and worker_tokens.py at the
#        same moment; the shell's EXIT trap removed the folder while
#        worker_tokens.py was still stopping the unit, its timing write died with
#        FileNotFoundError, and the unit's own log went with the folder. Here the
#        run is started under the gate's own supervisor (proc_tree.py run) and
#        stopped the way the gate stops it (TERM to the supervisor); the folder
#        must outlive the unit's own TERM cleanup, the unit's last output must
#        be printed, no receipt may be written, and the folder must come from
#        the scratch allocator with this run's pid as its owner and be released
#        afterward.
#
# Exit 0 = all cases pass; exit 1 = at least one failure. A scoped run
# (--contamination-only, --stop-only) exits 3 when its cases pass.

# throwaway home and every variable pointing into the operator's record removed
# (CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR and RICHOS_WORKSPACES_DIR included, so their defaults
# follow HOME), and the canary watches THAT: a unit that would have written the operator's
# record writes the throwaway one and is still red (S15b-S15d, the positive

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The reproduction of the merge gate's refusals of cc/zach-sonnet-vinputs1:
# the run is started under the supervisor the gate uses (proc_tree.py run) and
# stopped the way the gate stops a check at its cap (TERM to that supervisor,
# whose finish_scope then sends TERM to every process of the run at once). The
# unit TRAPS TERM and spends a second on its own cleanup before it prints its
# last line, so a folder removed at the moment of the signal is caught three
# ways: worker_tokens.py's timing write fails (the gate's FileNotFoundError),
# the unit's last line is never printed, and nothing names where it was.
