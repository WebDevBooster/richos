# THE WORK SEAT. ecs_active_context is a CURSOR keyed by person_id, not a store: it
# answers "which entity, thread, session and turn is this principal in right now",
# while the records themselves are keyed by entity and thread. The conversation
# rewrites that one row at the start of every turn, so a background assignment
# holding a binding frozen minutes ago is stale the moment the CEO speaks. It gets
# its own row instead -- one per assignment, never one per lease, because the table
# is person_id PRIMARY KEY and a second assignment on one seat upserts the first
# one's cursor out from under it. The seat is explicit or absent; absent is the
# CEO's own cursor and every call shape that predates seats is untouched.
#
# HIS OWN SEATS, ONE PER CONVERSATION THREAD, for the same reason and in the same
# table: he can run several conversation threads at once, each holding its own
# front desk, and N front desks on the one ceo-default row is the collision above
# with the CEO on both sides of it -- thread B's bind upserts thread A's cursor,
# and A's next checkpoint raises "stale app binding", which
# with_fresh_active_fence never retries (ecs_core.py:171-220: a ScopeError "is not
# a race"), so the turn dead-letters. A thread's seat is DERIVED from the thread
# (ceo_seat -> "ceo-thread:<thread_id>"), so the two halves below never ask
# whether a person equals the PERSON_ID literal: they ask is_ceo_row, which
# re-derives the seat from the row's own thread and requires the ceo audience. A
# work seat named after an assignment answers no, whatever audience it asks for.
