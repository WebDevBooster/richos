# ECS app protocol 1

Run `python3 ecs/bin/ecs --state-root /absolute/private/state` and supply one JSON
object on stdin. Requests are limited to 1 MiB. Every request names `protocol: 1`
and `command`. Success returns `{protocol:1, ok:true, result:...}`. Failure returns
`{protocol:1, ok:false, error:{kind,message}}` with exit 2. An unavailable component
or unreadable store is distinct from an empty result. The Rust bridge applies a
20-second deadline and a 4 MiB response bound.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `hello` | Read-only delivery/protocol identity without creating state |
| `current` | Host reads the current binding for compare-and-set activation |
| `bind` | Host binds entity, thread, session, turn and audience with expected revision |
| `checkpoint` | Persist typed operational statements with a stable request ID |
| `receipt` | Read a previous checkpoint receipt in the same entity and thread |
| `brief` | Bounded continuity text, counts and an inspection route |
| `inspect` | Scoped paginated records with sequence fencing |
| `observe` | Host-issued provider observation, never verified assignment completion |
| `import-preview` | Read-only neutral envelope validation and mapping preview |
| `import-apply` | Fenced application with durable partial receipts |
| `seats` | Host reads every seat there is, so orphans can be reconciled |
| `release-seat` | Host releases one worker seat, fenced on that seat's revision |

After binding, commands other than the read-only preview carry the exact
`binding` object returned by `bind`: entity_id, thread_id, session_id, turn_id,
audience and revision. Each mutation checks its scope transactionally. A scope
switch invalidates the old binding. Read results are fenced again before return.
A previous successful binding receipt cannot reactivate a superseded scope.

## Seats

The active context is a **cursor**, not a store: it answers which entity, thread,
session and turn one principal is in right now, while the records themselves are
keyed by entity and thread. It is one row per seat, and the conversation rewrites
its own row at the start of every turn. A caller whose binding was frozen before
that turn is therefore stale against the conversation's cursor and current
against its own.

So a request may name a `seat`. An absent seat is the conversation's own cursor
and every call shape that predates seats is unchanged. A named seat is fenced
against that seat's row, and the events a command appends carry the fenced row's
own person, so a background record can never land on the conversation's cursor by
default.

A seat is **one per assignment**, created with it and released with it. One seat
shared by two assignments is the same collision one level in: the table is keyed
by person, so registering the second upserts the first one's cursor and the
first one's frozen binding is stale from then on.

- Bind carries the seat on `thread.activated` only. `entity.registered`,
  `thread.created` and `session.observed` are statements about things that exist
  and are the same facts for whoever is looking, so they stay on the registry
  person; binding them under a seat is refused as a re-registration.
- `checkpoint`, `receipt` and `brief` are the conversation's and are refused on a
  seat that is not its own. They read that cursor by construction, and an
  allow-list on tool names cannot see whose seat is calling.
- `inspect` on a seat reads that seat's cursor and that seat's audience. A seat
  bound `worker` sees only worker records.
- `seats` and `release-seat` are the host's, refused to any other seat. A seat
  with no assignment behind it is a defect and is reconciled where receipts are;
  a release is an event, so it survives a projection rebuild, and only a seat
  whose audience is `worker` can be released at all.

The model-facing MCP server exposes only `checkpoint` and `inspect`. It takes
its state location and binding from an app-owned scope file. Tool arguments
cannot override either. The app grants access only during a visible turn and
revokes it when the turn returns. Hidden context preparation has no write grant.
This is an application protocol boundary, not an operating-system sandbox.

Checkpoints contain `statements: [{verb, fields}]` or an explicit
`{no_changes:true, reason:...}`. Fields are strings. Opening verbs are priority,
initiative, open_loop, commitment, decision, deadline and blocker. Updates name
the existing `id`. A model-authored checkpoint cannot mark external work
completed, including through an update. Provider exit is not a Git verification
receipt. Completion and correction routing must use their owning app adapters.

A repeated checkpoint ID with identical content returns its receipt. Changed
content is rejected. Interrupted multi-statement checkpoints reconcile existing
statement events before continuing. ECS does not claim a transaction spanning
the app ledger, Loro, a provider or Git.

Schema upgrades hold a migration lock and back up existing SQLite state before
applying new migrations. Individual migrations are transactional. Missing or
unknown migrations are errors, including code downgrade over newer state. Restore
a backup into a separate state root with compatible code; do not overwrite later
work. The tests verify that restoration preserves the previous active scope.
