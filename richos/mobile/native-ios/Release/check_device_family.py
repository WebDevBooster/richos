"""Refuses an app the App Store Connect processing would reject for its device family.

    check_device_family.py <path to an .app, or to an .xcarchive>

RichConnect is an iPhone app: the app and every extension must declare exactly `UIDeviceFamily` [1].
On 2026-10-04 a build declared [1, 2] (XcodeGen gave each target its own "1,2" default over the
project-level "1"); Apple refused it with error 90023 (no 152x152 and no 167x167 iPad icon) and
error 90474 (iPad multitasking needs all four orientations). This reads what Apple reads, from the
built Info.plists and the compiled asset catalog, so it needs no signing and no network.

Checks, each printed as one line; exit 0 only when all pass:
  - the app and every PlugIns/*.appex have UIDeviceFamily exactly [1]
  - the app's icon: CFBundleIconName is AppIcon and Assets.car holds the 120 and 180 px iPhone
    renditions and the 1024 px App Store one (when a catalog is present)
  - the orientation set is valid for the declared devices: an app that is not iPhone-only must
    declare all four orientations (error 90474); an iPhone-only app may declare any non-empty set
  - the app was built with the iOS 26 SDK or later (DTSDKName / DTPlatformVersion in Info.plist);
    App Store Connect refuses anything older (2026-10-04: "built with the iOS 18.5 SDK")
Exit 2 on a usage error.
