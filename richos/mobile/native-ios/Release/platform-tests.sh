# Compiles the core (RichOSCore) as a module, then two test programs with swiftc:
#   notification  NotificationService/Tests/main.swift — preview decryption against the Mac's own
#                 sealed fixture, the extension's decision, tap parsing and routing, registration
#   share         ShareExtension/Tests/main.swift — the inbox, the Mac's attachment limits and
#                 types, delivery against a fake Mac, the 3-second rule, HEIC to JPEG, and the
#                 share sheet's activation rule
# Each prints "<name>: N checks passed" and exits 0, or lists its failures and exits 1.
# Why swiftc and not the core's Swift package: these files belong to the app and its extensions
# (App/Platform/Shared is compiled into all three), and the package is stream I1's file.
