/**
 * The RichOS palette, one instance per appearance.
 *
 * Every value is either a ruled token (richos-hq `design/system/tokens.css`, §14 dark
 * "Sovereign", §15 light "Daybreak") or a DECLARED gap value from round 12's `NOTES.md`
 * ("Gaps — values chosen here, declared for the CEO"). Nothing else. The comments name the
 * source of each value so a reviewer can check it without opening the mockup.
 *
 * Contrast for every text pairing is computed, never eyeballed: [ContrastPairings] lists them
 * and `ContrastTest` fails the build if one drops below its WCAG AA floor.
