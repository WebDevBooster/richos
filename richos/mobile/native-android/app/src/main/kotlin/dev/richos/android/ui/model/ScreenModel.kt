/**
 * Everything one frame of the app shows: PURE PRESENTATION.
 *
 * [app] is core's [AppState], and wherever it already knows a thing the screens read it from
 * there: the conversation (the Mac's rows: who spoke, text or voice, a reply still arriving, a reply
 * with audio), the draft, the theme, whether the phone is online, the pairing (intro, the code on its way,
 * the six words, a refusal, removal from the Mac), the outbox (every pending bubble, and whether
 * pairing or forgetting is blocked by unsent work, the "Waiting to send" card), what the Mac can
 * do (voice, photos and files), whether the gold circle is a microphone or a send arrow, and the
 * connection (the one nameplate line, only after core's 3 s of trouble; the composer off for a Mac
 * that needs a newer app; cached history before this launch reached the Mac). [refusal] is the
 * sentence core gave for the last refused action.
 *
 * Every other field is a STAND-IN for state core does not own yet (escalation
 * esc-20260922T204145Z-7e81fe5e; lead's answer: "pure presentation … as each lands, switch that
 * screen group to derive from core and delete the stand-in field"). A stand-in holds a value to
 * draw, never a rule: no thresholds, no timers that decide anything, no protocol. The voice
 * gesture's numbers, the outbox, pairing and connection logic belong to core, where the command
 * line proves them. Each stand-in names the core domain that replaces it.
