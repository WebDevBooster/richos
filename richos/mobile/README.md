# RichOS on your phone

**Purely optional.** RichOS runs completely on one Mac in your office. Nothing here is needed for that,
in the same way that syncing a second Mac through GitHub is optional.

**What a mobile app is, here:** an app that lets you use RichOS while you are on the go and away from
the office, outside your home network. Inside your home network the desktop app is the better tool.

The iOS development foundation is under construction here. See [the mobile development loop](DEVELOPMENT.md) for shared core, CLI and simulator commands. This is not yet a released iOS app. Android is a later decision.

Until then, the web app can already be used for talking to Rich from your phone. It has similar looks
and functionality to a native mobile app: open it once, add it to your home screen, and it runs like an
app.

**The web app lives here: [`richos/web/web-app`](../web/web-app/).** Its README explains how to pair
your phone with RichOS on your Mac.

**Reaching your Mac from outside the office** takes one of two paths:

- **Technical users:** your own Tailscale account on the Mac and on the phone. RichOS guides you
  through it with simple how-to screens in the app. Full setup and troubleshooting, including the one
  thing that trips up almost everybody: [**Tailscale setup and
  troubleshooting**](./TAILSCALE-SETUP-AND-TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

  **The one thing, said here too, because it decides everything after it:** Tailscale has no username
  and password. You sign in with a Google, Apple, Microsoft or GitHub identity, and that identity **is**
  your private network — so your Mac and your phone must sign in with the **same** one. Two different
  identities make two separate networks that cannot see each other, and neither device says so. If you
  would rather not use a personal identity on both devices, make one that is only for this — a new
  Google account costs nothing — and use it on both. Decide before you sign in anywhere; the
  [setup page](./TAILSCALE-SETUP-AND-TROUBLESHOOTING.md) has the rest.
- **Everyone else:** a hosted relay, coming later.

The web app ships inside RichOS on your Mac and talks only to it. There is no server of ours in
between today, nothing to sign up for with us, and nothing to pay us for.
