"""physical.py — what may touch a physical phone, and how (CEO, 2026-10-02).

His rule: only the build users get (release) ever goes on his wired phones, and every test on them
tests that build. His standing rule (2026-10-01): never wipe or reinstall the app; install over the
existing build only, keeping its data. On 2026-10-02 the wired Android phone ran a debuggable build
from 00:40Z to about 08:30Z; its screen sat blank 2.1-2.6 s per cold start against 0.25-0.34 s on the
release build, and he judged the app by it.

So a physical phone is touched ONLY through the two command lines, `randroid device ...` and
`rios device ...`, and this file holds their rules (both call it; nothing else should):

    physical.py android-build   --adb ADB --serial S        the installed build; never refused
    physical.py android-gate    --adb ADB --serial S        exit 0 (the installed build as JSON) or 3
    physical.py android-install --adb ADB --serial S --apk APK --aapt2 AAPT2
    physical.py android-record  --adb ADB --serial S --out FILE.mp4 [--seconds N]
    physical.py android-condition --adb ADB --serial S [--seconds N] [--out DIR]
                                                            READ ONLY: what automation left running or
                                                            changed on the phone, and its log flood
    physical.py ios-app APP                                 exit 0 for a Release bundle, 3 otherwise
    physical.py hold --platform android|ios --phone ID [--wait S] [--holder NAME] -- <command>
                                                            run <command> holding that phone's lock
    physical.py status --platform android|ios --phone ID    free or held, and by whom (JSON)
    physical.py scan [--root DIR]                           the commit check (autocheck.py runs it)

One user per phone (CEO 2026-10-02): see "one user per phone" below. The lock records live in
/Volumes/E1TB/state/richos/phone-locks/<android-<sha256(serial)[:16]> | ios-iphone>.json.

The gate refuses: an emulator (it goes through `randroid emu`), and a phone whose installed
RichConnect is debuggable (`dumpsys package` pkgFlags DEBUGGABLE), naming the build it found. The
install refuses an APK whose manifest is debuggable (aapt2's own reading), installs with
`adb install -r` (the app's data kept), and never uninstalls: when the phone refuses (a build signed
by another key is installed), it says so and leaves the phone as it was, because replacing that
build means an uninstall, which wipes the app's data, and that is the CEO's decision. An emulator or
a simulator is never refused here; it has its own commands.

Exit codes: 0 done, 2 cannot answer (bad arguments, a tool missing), 3 refused, with the sentence.

# changed that a person would not, and the phone's log flood. READ ONLY: every command below is a
# read (`settings get`, never put; `wm size` with no argument; `logcat` without -c; `dumpsys` with no
# reset flag); `read_only` checks each command before it runs, and mobile-device.test.py (D34) checks every call. Nothing is fixed,
# reset, killed or restarted here; the report says what it found, and a person decides. The CEO's own
# app is only asked whether it runs (`pidof`), never read beyond that. A debuggable test copy is
# REPORTED, not refused: seeing the phone's state is never refused (as `device build`).

# -- one user per phone -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CEO, 2026-10-02: two agents used the iPhone at once and broke each other's runs twice. Every
# command of the two verbs runs inside `hold`: an exclusive lock per physical phone for the whole
# use (a perf series, a recording, a UI-test session: the command's full length, never per adb
# call; `randroid device hold -- <script>` keeps it across a walker's many commands). The lock is
# the kernel's (flock), so it is released however the holder ends, a crash or a kill included; the
# record beside it says who holds it (teammate, process, start, command). A second caller is refused
# at once with the holder's name, or waits up to --wait seconds, saying so. A holder whose process
# is gone left its lock released; the next caller says so and takes it. Queried by `status`.
# The iPhone lock is one for every spelling of the phone (hardware UDID, CoreDevice UUID): the Mac
# has one wired iPhone, and two spellings must never be two locks.
