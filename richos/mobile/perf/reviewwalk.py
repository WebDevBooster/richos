"""reviewwalk.py — no RichConnect build goes to a store review before an automated walk of exactly what
the store's reviewer does has passed on that exact build.

THE CEO, 2026-10-04 (richos-hq/wiki/ceo-decisions.md §107): the CEO is never the first tester. No build
goes to a store review until an automated walk of exactly what the reviewer does has passed on that
exact build, and the command checks it itself.

One record per walk, shared by both platforms' walks and both platforms' gates:

  /Volumes/E1TB/state/richos/review-walk/<platform>/<full commit sha>.json
  {"platform": "ios" | "android", "commit": "<full sha>", "passed": true | false,
   "at": "<ISO UTC>", "host": "<review host name>",
   "steps": [{"name": "...", "ok": true | false, "detail": "..."}, ...]}

A walk writes it (`write`, or `reviewwalk.py write` with the record on stdin); the latest walk of a
commit replaces the earlier one, so a later failure withdraws an earlier pass. A gate reads it
(`check`, or `reviewwalk.py check`). The gate passes only when the file for that platform and that
commit exists, is readable, names that platform and that commit, says passed: true, and lists at least
one step with every step ok. Anything else refuses, naming the platform, the commit and what is
missing or failing. It fails closed and has no skip flag; the records are read from the fixed state
directory only (a test passes its own directory to the functions, never through the command line).

  reviewwalk.py check --platform ios|android --commit SHA
      exit 0 with one JSON object on stdout ({ok, platform, commit, record, line}),
      or exit 1 with one REFUSED line on stderr.
  reviewwalk.py write < record.json
      validates the record's shape and writes it atomically; prints the path.
