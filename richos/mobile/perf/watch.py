"""watch.py — the phone speed check that runs by itself after every land that touches richos/mobile/.

THE CEO, 2026-10-01: the mobile apps must ALWAYS be super-fast; the cold start and
back-from-background benchmarks must always be maintained. On 2026-10-02 he found his Android cold
starts noticeably slower than the day before and a long blank screen on the iPhone's start, and
nothing had told anyone. A slower start must be caught by the system the moment it happens, never
by him. Until this file, `perf.py compare` judged a record only when someone ran it; nothing in the
engine (merge gate, land, schedules) ran a phone.

WHAT STARTS A RUN. Git, at the land. richos/app/scripts/autocheck/autocheck.py's post-merge and
post-commit hooks call `watch.py trigger --repo <checkout> --from <old main> --to <new main>` every
time main moves in a checkout (a merge, a fast-forward, a commit on main). The trigger:
  1. acts only in the operator's own main checkout (RICHOS_PHONE_WATCH_REPO, else the checkout the
     engine plugin is loaded from, ~/.claude/richos-engine/../..). A clone a test suite merges into
     never reaches a phone;
  2. names every earlier request that no run ever finished (a runner killed, a Mac restarted) as a
     MISSED run in Rich's escalation ledger, once each, and starts a runner to retry it;
  3. when old..new changes anything under richos/mobile/, records the request in the ledger and
     starts ONE detached runner (`watch.py run`), its own session, so the land returns at once.
A land that touches nothing under richos/mobile/ starts nothing.

WHAT A RUN DOES, per wired phone (Android and iPhone in parallel, each as soon as it is free), in
its own clone of main's tip on the external SSD (never a worktree of the repository):
  - does not run a phone whose app code did not change (CEO 2026-10-03): when no path that builds into
    that phone's app (is_app_code: its native-* directory minus tests, tooling, the headless CLI and
    notes) changed since its last measurement, that measurement's samples are judged AGAIN against the
    current limits and the phone is not touched (`unchanged`; a newly failing verdict is escalated).
  - measures the phone as soon as one sample shows it free (CEO 2026-10-04: the phone is for
    testing; there is no quiet period): no process outside this run's own tree names the phone's
    serial or identifier or runs a phone tool (phone-android.py, phone-ios.py,
    hidden-send-try.py, devicectl, xctrace, an adb client). Only while such a command is running
    right now does it wait, polling every POLL_S, and it never interrupts anything. A phone still
    busy after MAX_WAIT_S (6 h) is reported, never measured.
  - touches the phone ONLY through the platform command lines (CEO mandate, §76 addendum,
    CLI-first mobile development): `randroid device install` and `randroid device perf` on
    Android, `rios device install` and `rios device perf` on the iPhone (VERBS below). They build
    the RELEASE build of the clone, install it over the existing app with its data kept (never an
    uninstall), seed the fixed made-up conversation the benchmarks were taken with, measure TRIALS
    (100) cold starts and TRIALS returns from the background (the protocol of the benchmark series),
    put the app's own saved state back and write one perf.py record. The phone is left on that
    release build. (The verbs came with zach-opus-releaseonly1 and andy-sonnet-twin1; a checkout
    without them reports COULD NOT MEASURE naming the missing verb.) The perf verb is perf.py's
    measurement run, which judges its own record and exits 1 when a phase failed (the blank-screen
    check's FAIL among them) and 4 when it is slower than the benchmark: with a record written,
    those exits are a measurement and go on to the comparison and the blank-screen check below;
    without one, or with any other exit (3 refused, 6 the phone's own state NOT restored), the run
    could not measure.
  - runs `perf.py compare` on the record (it reads files only, never a phone). Both metrics must be
    compared; a NOT COMPARED metric is a run that could not measure.
  - signs the Android build: `randroid device install` and `randroid device perf` run inside
    richos-hq's scripts/with-android-signing.py (RICHOS_PHONE_WATCH_SIGNING names another), because
    randroid refuses an unsigned Release APK and a debuggable twin without the upload key. The iPhone has its own signing team (RICHOS_APPLE_TEAM).
  - puts phone_guard.py in front of adb and xcrun for everything the verbs start (first on PATH):
    an uninstall or a data clear is refused, the run stops there and is reported REFUSED (CEO rule
    2026-10-01: never uninstall the app or clear its data, on either phone).
  - BLANK SCREEN (CEO 2026-10-02: no blank screen on start): on Android the perf verb runs
    quint-opus-blank1's cold-start check inside the same measurement (perf.py's `cold-blank` phase,
    `--blank-starts` BLANK_STARTS: blankstart.android_cold_blank taps the icon with the screen
    recorded and blank.py judges each recording), and the record carries the verdict as
    `metrics.coldBlank`. blank_screen_problems() below reads it: a FAIL makes the run a REGRESSION
    exactly as a slower p95 does, and an Android record without the verdict is a run that could not
    measure. The analyzer runs inside the verb because it needs the phone, which this file reaches
    only through the verbs. The iPhone's cold-start blank check needs isaac-opus-white1's screen
    recording; until then an iPhone record without `coldBlank` says so, and one with it is judged.

WHAT REACHES RICH. Every outcome but a good or unchanged one raises an escalation in the committed
ledger (richos/engine/scripts/escalate.sh, read at every session start and turn end, louder at 1 h,
24 h and 72 h): SLOWER than the benchmark, REFUSED (it would have needed an uninstall), or COULD NOT
MEASURE with the reason (no phone wired, busy for 6 h, a verb failed or does not exist yet, not
compared). Each names the commit range since the last good run of that phone, and the commits in it
that touch richos/mobile/. A good run is recorded (good.json), so the next regression names a short
range.

HOW A MISSED RUN BECOMES VISIBLE. The trigger writes the request BEFORE it starts the runner, a
runner writes `started` and `finished` around each round, and the lock (run.lock) is held for as
long as a runner lives. A request no finished round covers, with no runner holding the lock, is
reported as MISSED by the next trigger, which is every later move of main, mobile or not. A trigger
that cannot start a runner reports it at once. `watch.py status` prints all of it.

State (private: records name the phones) lives in RICHOS_PHONE_WATCH_HOME, default
/Volumes/E1TB/state/richos/phone-speed-watch: ledger.jsonl, good.json, run.lock, runner.log,
runs/<round>/<platform>/ (record, log, guard; the newest 20 rounds and every round a good run
points at are kept), checkout/ (the build clone).
