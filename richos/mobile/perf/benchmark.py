"""benchmark — a new perf record against the start times RichConnect has already achieved.

The private benchmark file (found through RICHOS_MOBILE_PERF_BENCHMARKS, else the default in `DEFAULT`;
this public tree holds no phone-derived number) holds, per device class (platform, device kind, model, build
configuration and route), the best p95 measured so far for cold launch and warm resume, each with
the record, the build commit and the date it came from, and the run-to-run noise allowance derived
from the repeated series of that class. A class that was never measured as a distribution says so
in the file and carries no number.

    compare(records, bench)  every metric, each FASTER, WITHIN NOISE, SLOWER or NOT COMPARED (why)
    update(bench, records)   the only way a number in the file changes; the caller commits the file

The noise rule. A p95 from n trials is itself a random number: run the same build again and it
moves. For each repeated series of a class, `p95_noise` resamples the series' own samples with
replacement (2000 resamples, seeded, so the same samples always give the same answer), takes the
nearest-rank p95 of each resample, and calls the standard deviation of those p95s the series'
standard error (SE). The difference of two independent runs' p95s has standard error sqrt(2) x SE,
so 1.96 x sqrt(2) x SE is its 95% bound: a rerun of the same build lands above the benchmark by more
than that about one time in forty. That is the series' two-run bound, as a percent of its p95. A class's allowance for a metric is the MEDIAN of its
series' bounds: one series dominated by a single long-tail trial cannot widen it for everyone.
A record is SLOWER when its p95 exceeds benchmark x (1 + allowance). Nothing else loosens it.

Why not the spread between the series: series measured on different builds differ by real code
changes, and that is the kind of slowdown this check exists to catch, so it cannot also be the allowance.
