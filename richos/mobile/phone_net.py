"""phone_net.py — the test iPhone must be able to reach Apple, or nothing runs on it (CEO, 2026-10-02).

Why this exists. iOS verifies the developer certificate of an app signed for development ONLINE, each
time its cached verification has lapsed. A phone that cannot reach Apple at that moment refuses to open
the app: "Unable to Verify App. An internet connection is required to verify trust of the developer",
and every XCUITest session on it fails "The application could not be launched because the Developer
App Certificate is not trusted" (the test iPhone, 2026-09-24 and 2026-10-02 from 12:27Z: the refusal
came and went between passing runs, so the phone's route to Apple was flapping, not the app). The run
that follows such a refusal tests nothing, and it said so only after a build, an install and minutes.

So `rios device` (verify, run, perf, hold) calls this module around the phone's one use:

    preflight   one cheap launch of RichConnect through devicectl, then it is closed again. A refusal
                that names the missing verification restarts the PHONE once (the function below,
                CEO 2026-10-02: no passcode, so it comes back usable without a hand) and opens the app
                again; only when that still fails does it raise `Unreachable` with ONE plain sentence,
                before anything is built, installed or run. A locked phone, a missing tool or any other
                answer is not a verdict on the network: it is said and the run goes on.
    postflight  the same launch after the run, however the run ended. When the phone now refuses,
                the run left its network off (a step list that switches Wi-Fi off in Settings and did not
                get to switch it back): `RICHOS_PHONE_NET_RESTORE` (default `phone-ios.py wifi-restore`)
                reads the Wi-Fi switch in Settings and turns it on, and the launch is tried once more.
                What is still wrong is said in a sentence; it is never hidden behind the run's own exit.

The phone is named by RICHOS_IOS_DEVICE (what xcodebuild and devicectl both accept). Nothing here
installs, uninstalls or erases anything, and it never touches the phone's screen beyond opening and
closing the app and, when the trust check fails, one restart of the phone.
