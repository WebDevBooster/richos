// Rich, on a phone. One screen, four verbs: send text, send a voice note, receive Rich, hear Rich.
//
// This file is the wiring. The parts that can be wrong in a way a person notices live in `lib/`,
// where they are driven by tests without a browser: the recorder's arithmetic (`pcm.js`), the send
// queue's state machine (`queue.js`), the thread's ordering (`thread.js`), the routes (`api.js`),
// and what survives being closed (`storage.js`). What is left here is the part that only means
// anything with a screen attached, and the browser harness drives it in a real browser.
//
// THREE DECISIONS IN HERE ARE THE PRODUCT, not implementation detail:
//
//   1. THE MICROPHONE PROMPT IS PART OF THE GESTURE, NOT A MODAL BEFORE IT. iOS asks for the
//      microphone on every launch of an installed web app — measured on his own iPhone X on
//      2026-09-18, and the browser reported the permission as "granted" while still asking. So the
//      first hold of the session opens the microphone and the dialog appears under his finger. When
//      he lifts his finger to tap Allow, the release does NOT become a dead recording: the app says
//      the microphone is on and asks him to hold again. A dead recording there is the app telling
//      him the microphone is broken when it is working, which is the worst thing it could say.
//
//   2. THE THREE SEND STATES ARE HONEST, and the middle one is the real one. An optimistic bubble;
//      then "waiting to send — your Mac isn't reachable from here" with the reason; then delivered
//      when the Mac has it. The middle state is not a reassurance — it is the truth that his message
//      is still on this phone.
//
//   3. NOTHING HE READS IS AN IDENTIFIER. No message id, no device id, no cursor, no hash. His probe
//      walk ended with a horizontal scroll bar caused by a SHA-256 printed in one line; the rule
//      that came out of it is not "wrap the hash", it is "do not put one in front of him".
