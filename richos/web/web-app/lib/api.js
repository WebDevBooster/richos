// THE ONE PLACE THAT KNOWS THE ROUTES.
//
// `CONTRACT-STUB.md` in this directory says why this module exists as a module: the real route
// contract is Echo's and it was not in the tree when the phone was written, so every route, every
// header and every field name is behind this file. Reconciling with the real contract is an edit
// here and to `test/api.test.js`, and nothing above it moves.
//
// THREE THINGS IN HERE ARE LOAD-BEARING AND ARE NOT DETAILS:
//
//   1. THE API BASE IS DATA, THE ORIGIN IS IDENTITY (plan §10.7). Nothing in this file assumes the
//      Mac is at the address the app was loaded from. `state.apiBase` is read at EVERY request, it
//      starts as the origin, and it is replaced by whatever the Mac last advertised — in the stream's
//      `hello` or in a push payload. Without that seam a public address that changes orphans the
//      installed app, the push subscription and the cache, and no push can fix it because the push
//      is delivered TO the origin it is trying to replace. With it, every later way of reaching him
//      from away is an implementation of one interface.
//
//   2. THE SIGNATURE IS OVER THE SERVER'S OWN CHALLENGE. The device key is a non-extractable P-256
//      key (plan §2.7); the Mac issues the challenge; the phone replays the most recent one it was
//      given. Ordering is never client-generated, and neither is the thing being signed.
//
//   3. FAILURES ARE CLASSIFIED, because the whole honesty of the send queue rests on telling
//      "your Mac is not reachable from here" apart from "your Mac refused this". A `TypeError` from
//      `fetch` is unreachable; a 403 carrying `{"revoked":true}` is final and must never be retried;
//      a 404 is the flat refusal §2.5 specifies for an unauthorized caller and is also not a retry.
//      Everything else is a fault with a status attached.
//
// No dependencies, no framework, and no `EventSource` unless the platform gives one. Loads as a
// plain script (defines `globalThis.RichOSApi`) and as a CommonJS module.

	///   1. It is under `/api/`, so `sw.js` refuses to touch it (`sw.js` line 83 returns without
	///      responding for every `/api/` request). A probe the service worker could answer from its
	///      shell cache would hand back a response with no challenge header and no Mac behind it.
	///   2. Today's Mac has no such route, so it falls through to the static table, misses, and
	///      answers 404 — WITH a fresh challenge, because every answer on that port carries one
	///      (`app/src-tauri/src/phone/listen.rs:334-342`, and its test at `listen.rs:557` pins the
	///      404 case by name). The status is deliberately not read here.
