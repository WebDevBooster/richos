// THE ONE THING THAT OWNS THE EVENT STREAM. Exactly one source is alive, ever.
//
// Under the first of the three base assumptions this whole channel is built on (CEO, §60 — the
// Mac is on 24/7 and is the server), the Mac is the side that stays and the PHONE is the side that
// comes and goes: asleep in a pocket, off Wi-Fi, on cellular, out of range on a walk. So a
// reconnect is the ordinary case for this app, not an edge, and everything below is about the
// ordinary case.
//
// FOUR THINGS IN HERE ARE THE DECISION, not implementation detail:
//
//   1. THE BROWSER'S OWN RECONNECT IS THE DEFECT, SO IT IS TURNED OFF. An `EventSource` reconnects
//      by itself, to THE URL IT WAS GIVEN — and this app's stream URL carries its credential in
//      the query string, because `EventSource` cannot send a header. That signature is over a
//      challenge that is dead ten minutes later (`app/src-tauri/src/phone/device.rs:62`:
//      CHALLENGE_LIFETIME_MS = 600_000 ms = 600 s = 10 minutes). So the browser's loop reopens a
//      refused URL forever and can never learn why, because an `EventSource` cannot read a
//      response header either. Calling `close()` on the source is what STOPS that loop, and it is
//      the first thing this file does on an error. One loop, and it is this one.
//
//   2. EVERY RE-OPEN IS NEWLY SIGNED, AND ASKS FOR A LIVE CHALLENGE FIRST. `open` is called again
//      rather than a URL being reused, and a retry — never the first connect — runs `refresh`
//      before it, which is the plain `fetch` in `lib/api.js` whose header this app CAN read. A
//      re-signature over a challenge the Mac has already forgotten is refused exactly as fast as
//      the original was, which is why re-signing ALONE does not recover a phone that was away for
//      more than ten minutes.
//
//   3. A GENERATION, NOT A BOOLEAN. Opening is asynchronous — it signs, and signing awaits. Two
//      overlapping calls therefore both reach `new EventSource` before either can be recorded, and
//      the old code's `if (stream) stream.close()` cannot see a source that does not exist yet.
//      That is how a second stream survives beside the first, unreferenced and unclosable, feeding
//      frames into the app forever. Every attempt here carries a generation; an attempt whose
//      generation has been superseded closes the source it just opened and delivers nothing.
//
//   4. COMING BACK ON SCREEN WAKES THE PENDING RETRY; IT NEVER OPENS A SECOND ONE. `wake()` is
//      what `visibilitychange` calls. If a retry is already scheduled it fires NOW rather than in
//      however many seconds were left — he is looking at the screen, so the wait is his wait. It
//      does not reset the backoff: he can foreground the app twenty times while the Mac is off,
//      and that must not become twenty immediate attempts a second apart.
//
// No dependencies. Loads as a plain script (defines `globalThis.RichOSLink`) and as a CommonJS
// module, the same as everything else in `lib/`.

(function (root, factory) {
	const link = factory();
	if (typeof module === 'object' && module.exports) module.exports = link;
	root.RichOSLink = link;
})(typeof globalThis !== 'undefined' ? globalThis : this, function () {
	'use strict';

	// THE BACKOFF, AND THE ARITHMETIC IT PRODUCES — worked out here rather than asserted, because
	// what matters is the load two numbers put on his Mac and the wait they put in front of him.
	//
	// Doubling from 1 s, capped at 30 s, gives delays of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 30, 30, 30 … seconds, so
	// the attempt after an outage begins lands at t = 1 s, then 3 s, 7 s, 15 s, 31 s, 61 s, and
	// every 30 s after that. Five attempts inside the first minute, two a minute thereafter.
	//
	// A failed stream also makes one authenticated JSON probe (with at most one challenge
	// retry) to read a revocation refusal. Five retries therefore use at most 15 signed requests against the Mac's limit of 60 per
	// rolling minute (`device.rs`, RATE_LIMIT = 60), and at most ONE live stream against its limit
	// of 4 (MAX_STREAMS). A phone that reconnects all day cannot crowd out the phone.
	//
	// NO JITTER, deliberately. Jitter exists to break up a herd of clients retrying in step; this
	// channel has one phone and one Mac, so there is no herd, and a deterministic sequence is one
	// that can be told to a person and read off a log.
