// THE RECONNECT, DRIVEN AGAINST A REAL SIGNER AND A STUB `EventSource`. `node --test "test/*.test.js"`.

// What is being held still here is the thing a phone cannot survive without, under the first of
// the CEO's three base assumptions (§60 — the Mac is on 24/7 and is the server): the Mac stays and
// the PHONE comes and goes, so reconnecting is the ordinary case for this app.
//
// The defect this file exists for, measured on the base of this branch (richos `48104748`): an
// error on the stream closed nothing, re-signed nothing and attempted nothing. The browser's own
// `EventSource` loop reopened the URL IT WAS GIVEN — whose credential is in the query string,
// because `EventSource` cannot send a header — and that signature is over a challenge that is dead
// ten minutes later (`app/src-tauri/src/phone/device.rs:62`, CHALLENGE_LIFETIME_MS = 600_000 ms =
// 600 s = 10 minutes). A refused reconnect cannot even be seen from the phone, because an
// `EventSource` cannot read a response header either. So the phone hammered a Mac that refused it,
// forever, and said "Your Mac isn't reachable from here" the whole time.
//
// The signatures below are REAL ECDSA P-256 signatures over the real signing string, made by
// `lib/api.js` through `openEvents`, so "the next attempt carries a different `auth`" is asserted
// about the bytes that would go on the wire and not about a counter.
