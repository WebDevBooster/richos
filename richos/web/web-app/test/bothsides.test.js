// BOTH SIDES OF THE CONVERSATION REACH THE SCREEN. `npm test`.
//
// Ray's candidate .11 walk on the CEO's own Android, 2026-09-18
// (`docs/verification/2026-09-19-nightly-1.2.0-nightly.20260918.6-mac-and-android-audit.md` §4.1):
//
//     "Neither the message typed on the phone nor the one typed on the Mac ever appears in the
//      phone's thread — only Rich's replies do. Positive control: the Mac's copy of the same
//      thread shows 'hello from my phone' correctly, so the message arrived; the phone simply does
//      not render user turns."
//
// WHERE IT WAS, AND WHERE IT WAS NOT. The Mac was not the cause and its own tests say so:
// `rows_from_payload` keeps `user_message` and `rich_message` and drops only machinery
// (`app/src-tauri/src/phone/rows.rs:49-109`, asserted by
// `only_the_conversation_reaches_the_phone_and_no_machinery_does`), and every `hello` carries the
// whole projection — `"messages": rows` at `phone/routes.rs:494`. The page threw the frame's rows
// away: `app.js`'s `hello` handler read `vapid_public_key` and `threads` out of it and never
// touched `data.messages`.
//
// THREE THINGS ARE ASSERTED HERE, and they are three different failures:
//
//   1. THE DATA. A `hello` frame shaped the way the Mac builds it, merged, renders both roles.
//      This is the positive control — it passed before the fix too, which is exactly what makes
//      it worth keeping: it proves the rows were renderable and therefore that the page dropped
//      them.
//   2. THE WIRING. The shipped `app.js` merges `data.messages` in its `hello` handler. This is
//      the one that fails on `05ab7a0c`. It is asserted on the bytes because this file is an IIFE
//      that boots a browser app on load, and `test/desktop-verify.js` — the harness that drives
//      the real thing — needs Playwright and is not part of `npm test`.
//   3. HIS OWN MESSAGE, BETWEEN THE SEND AND THE PROJECTION. The queue drops an item the moment
//      the Mac takes it, and the Mac's own row for it only exists once the intake log is drained
//      — which runs on its own thread, behind the spine. `thread.confirm` holds his words in
//      that window and retires them on the Mac's own row rather than leaving two.
//
// AND A PREMISE THAT WAS TRUE WHEN THIS FILE WAS WRITTEN IS NOT ANY MORE, corrected here rather
// than left where a reader would believe it: *"no live frame in this build carries a CEO turn"*.
// `rich://ceo-message` has existed since `102b7c07`, so his own row arrives live on both roads —
// the desk's (`spine.rs`'s `accept_prompt`) and the phone's (`drain_intake`). Check 2b below is
// about the leg that claim used to excuse.

// than a slow network.
//
// THE PAGE'S HALF OF THE ANSWER IS THAT THERE IS NO SECOND PATH HERE, and this asserts it on the
// bytes: the `message` handler merges and schedules a repaint for whatever arrives, and the only
// thing it does per-role — `askForTheQuestion` — happens AFTER the merge and cannot hold a row
// back. A future edit that special-cases his own row (a batch, a debounce, a "wait for the reply
// then refresh") fails here.
//
// It does not and cannot measure the Mac's half; that is `phone::listen`'s
// `his_own_message_and_richs_reply_reach_the_phone_within_one_bound`, over real TLS.
