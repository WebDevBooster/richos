/**
 * Refuse, before Chrome starts, a native-host run that would put a macOS privacy dialog on screen.
 *
 * Why (2026-10-08). At 23:40:28Z on 2026-10-07 the CEO's Mac showed
 * `"node" would like to access files on a removable volume` and it stayed there, unanswered, until
 * he looked at the screen 1 h 45 min later. The unified log names the asker: node pid 1518, the
 * native host that Chrome for Testing (pid 1427, started 3 s earlier by native-transport-e2e.mjs)
 * launched through the shell launcher, reading
 * /Volumes/E1TB/tmp/claude/echo-opus-extclean1/main-tree/richos/tools/richos-service/package.json
 * from a test copy of the repository on the external SSD (`AUTHREQ_PROMPTING ...
 * service=kTCCServiceSystemPolicyRemovableVolumes, subject=Sub:{.../node/26.10.0_1/bin/node}
 * Resp:{... node ...}`, then `System Policy: node(1518) deny(4) file-read-data ...`).
 *
 * Chrome starts a native host with its responsibility disclaimed, so macOS judges the host as its
 * own privacy subject (the node binary), not as Terminal or Claude Code, whose permissions every
 * other test inherits. Node had no Removable Volumes permission, so its first read on the SSD
 * asked. The gate never asked before because it runs this test from a worktree on the internal
 * disk with TMPDIR in /var/folders; only a checkout or TMPDIR on /Volumes reaches it.
 *
 * So: when anything the host reads lies under /Volumes, the subject's grant is read from the
 * user's TCC database (read-only; with no Full Disk Access the read simply fails, never asks), and
 * anything but "allowed" refuses with the way to grant it once. Nothing here ever triggers a
 * dialog itself.
