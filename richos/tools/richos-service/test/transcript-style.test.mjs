/**
 * Transcript readability — one test per defect the CEO reported on 2026-10-04 (an imported video
 * whose transcript broke sentences across paragraphs, lost punctuation and capitalization partway
 * through, and lost the case of product names). Pure: no whisper, no ffmpeg.
 *
 *   node test/transcript-style.test.mjs
 *
 * The fixture is invented text in the exact SHAPE of the recorded defect (the recording's own words
 * stay in the private record): segments cut mid-sentence, then a window in the lowercase,
 * unpunctuated style with a lowercase "i" and lowercased names. `styledDecode` stands in for the
 * conditioned re-decode of that window's audio, i.e. what the model returns when it is given the
 * transcript's preceding text.
