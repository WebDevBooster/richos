/**
 * RichOS Workspace source — THE COMMANDS (`richos-service workspace …`).
 *
 * This is the runtime the library did not have. Before it, `lib/workspace/` held the governance layer,
 * the core spine, two adapters, the OAuth helpers and the token manager — and nothing anywhere
 * constructed any of them: no file outside `adapters/`, the README and the test suite so much as named
 * an adapter, and `core.js` had no caller at all. The CEO's own setup guide (Step 6) ends by telling
 * him to run `richos-service workspace connect google`, which did not exist. These four commands are
 * that sentence made true:
 *
 *   connect     the §6 auth ceremony — PKCE, the loopback consent leg, tokens into the OS keychain
 *   status      what is connected, how healthy the grant is, which sources run, what the last poll did
 *   sync        ONE pass of `ingestOnce` per granted source (`--once` is the only mode there is)
 *   disconnect  revoke vendor-side, then forget locally
 *
 * THREE DISCIPLINES HOLD THIS FILE TOGETHER.
 *
 * 1. NEVER-SILENT. Every refusal names the file, the scope or the step that would fix it. A source
 *    that will not run is printed BY NAME with the scope it lacks, because a sync that quietly covers
 *    fewer sources than the CEO believes is the exact failure this layer was built to prevent.
 * 2. NO TOKEN AND NO CLIENT SECRET IS EVER PRINTED — not truncated, not hashed, not in an error. Both
 *    live in the keychain and are read only by `TokenManager`; nothing here formats either. What the
 *    CEO sees of his client secret is the word "missing" or the words "in keychain".
 * 3. ONE PATH, NOT TWO. `status` reports the sources it does by calling the SAME `buildRegistry` that
 *    `sync` polls through, so what it displays cannot drift from what a sync would actually do. A
 *    display fed by its own second opinion is a wrong number waiting for a release.
 *
 * EVERY COMMAND HERE IS ACCOUNT-SHAPED (2026-09-17). The CEO has more than one Google account — the
 * first has his Drive and no mailbox, the second has his mail — so `connect --account X` ADDS X and
 * leaves every other grant alone, `status` and `sync` run the whole list and report per account and
 * per source, and `disconnect` will not guess which one he means while two are configured. The loop
 * is the only new thing: what happens INSIDE it for one account is the code that was already here,
 * reading one account's view of the config rather than the config.
 *
 * Everything external is injected (http, keychain backend, browser opener, clock, output sink) so the
 * suite drives the real dispatcher end to end against a mock Google — no live account, ever.
