/**
 * RichOS local service — P5 pipeline stage 3.7: the post-decode DELETION DETECTOR.
 *
 * THE CLASS `repetition-guard.js` CANNOT SEE. That module covers three measured failure classes —
 * repetition loop, sliding-overlap stutter, persistent ordinal insertion — and all three are the
 * model SAYING TOO MUCH. Every one of them leaves evidence in the text, which is why a text-only
 * detector can find them. **Deletion leaves no text at all.** The model emits nothing over a span
 * of real speech, with no repetition, no marker, no stutter, and — measured — no confidence signal
 * either: on the 2026-08-29 coverage measurement the tokens either side of a confirmed deletion
 * carried confidences of 0.94–1.00 and the file-level confidence was 0.94–0.96. **Any alarm built
 * on model confidence would have stayed silent.** So would every guard we had.
 *
 * WHY IT MATTERS, in the one number that commissioned this module: on 92 minutes of real
 * two-channel audio, `large-v3-turbo` at the decode configuration shipping before 2026-08-29
 * silently dropped 75.8 seconds of speech, including NINE complete clauses of >= 2 s on one
 * channel, each of which both an independent model and the same model recovered perfectly when the
 * burst was decoded on its own. `large-v3-turbo-q5_0` dropped >= 104.2 s. Nothing in the product
 * noticed, because nothing in the product was looking.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE DISCRIMINATOR, unchanged from the measurement that established it
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A CONFIRMED DELETION is:
 *
 *     a physically detected speech burst of >= minGapSec over which the run emitted NO word at
 *     all, where decoding THAT BURST IN ISOLATION returns real words.
 *
 * Both halves are load-bearing and neither is sufficient:
 *
 *   - The burst grid is MODEL-FREE (ffmpeg `silencedetect`, `normalize.js#detectSpeechBursts` —
 *     the same probe the repetition guard's physical veto already consumes, already computed once
 *     per channel by the pipeline, measured at 0.68 s for a 92-minute channel). It says where
 *     there is acoustic energy. It cannot say whether that energy is speech: the single loudest
 *     uncovered burst in the whole corpus — 5.81 s at max -0.9 dBFS — is LAUGHTER, and every
 *     model correctly emits nothing for it. **A detector that alarmed on raw burst gaps would have
 *     cried deletion over a man laughing.** That is the reason for the second half.
 *
 *   - The isolated re-decode is the ADJUDICATOR. A span decoded on its own has no prior context,
 *     no chunk seam and no adjacent repetition, so what comes back is what the audio contains.
 *     This is the same discriminator FluidAudio issue #850's reporter used and the same one the
 *     2026-08-29 briefs used on all 72 repetition findings.
 *
 * The measurement had a second model available and used "both decodes agree" as one arm of its
 * rule. THE RUNTIME HAS ONE MODEL, so that arm is replaced, not dropped — see THE PRECISION RULE.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * DETECT-ONLY, ON PURPOSE, AND THE PRECEDENT IS IN THE OTHER FILE
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A deletion cannot be repaired from here. Splicing the isolated decode back into the transcript
 * would give a timeline stitched from two different decodes of the same file, and the class of
 * defect that produces is worse than the one it fixes. So this follows class 2 (persistent
 * insertion) exactly: make the failure LOUD — a report, a pipeline alarm, and a plain-English
 * `verification.json` warning naming the span — and never rewrite the transcript. The audio is
 * retained; re-transcription is the remedy, and an alarm that names `01:23:19–01:23:22` is
 * actionable in a way that a silent gap never is.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE PRECISION RULE — five conditions, and why each one is there
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * PRECISION IS THE CONTRACT (same doctrine as the rest of this pipeline). A false deletion alarm
 * on every natural pause makes the alarm worthless and it gets switched off, and then it protects
 * nothing. **Genuine silence must not read as deletion** — and genuine silence and deletion look
 * identical in the transcript, since both are "no words here". Everything separating them is
 * physical. A candidate is called DELETED only when ALL FIVE hold:
 *
 *   1. DURATION      the burst is >= minGapSec (1.0 s). Below a second the burst grid's own edge
 *                    clipping dominates and the losses are single backchannel words; the corpus
 *                    put 82.8% speech in that band on one channel and 23.3% on the other, which is
 *                    not a rate anything can alarm on. Deliberately out of scope, stated loudly.
 *   2. LEXICAL       the isolated decode returns >= minProbeWords (3) DISTINCT INFORMATIVE words —
 *                    content words, deduplicated, with interjections and backchannel removed (see
 *                    FILLER_WORDS) — after the silence-hallucination vocabulary is stripped. Both
 *                    filters were forced by the corpus: whisper.cpp reliably emits
 *                    "Thank you." / "you" / "Shh" / "*sniff*" over near-silence — proven in this
 *                    corpus at 4885.2 s, where it emitted "Thank you." SEVEN times over a window
 *                    measuring max -51.3 dBFS. If a fabrication over silence were allowed to count
 *                    as evidence that speech was there, this detector would manufacture its own
 *                    false positives out of the exact failure it sits next to.
 *   3. LEVEL         the span's own max level is within loudBelowPeakDb (24 dB) of the CHANNEL's
 *                    peak. Relative, never absolute: the two capture setups in the corpus are not
 *                    level-matched (-34.6 vs -30.5 dBFS mean), so a shared absolute threshold is
 *                    invalid — the same reasoning, and the same shape, as
 *                    `normalize.js#SPEECH_FLOOR_BELOW_PEAK_DB`. On a channel peaking at -0.9 dBFS
 *                    this is -24.9 dBFS, reproducing the measurement's hand-verified -25 dBFS
 *                    clause. The nine confirmed deletions measured -6.6 to -17.6 dBFS; the
 *                    rejected near-silence gaps measured -27 to -44 dBFS.
 *   4. STABILITY     the span is decoded TWICE at two paddings and the two decodes must share at
 *                    least minStableWords (2) content words. This is the runtime replacement for
 *                    the measurement's "both models agree" arm. A real clause is in the audio and
 *                    survives having a little more or a little less room around it; a hallucination
 *                    over near-silence is a property of the exact window and is padding-fragile.
 *                    It costs one extra clip decode per candidate and nothing else — see COST.
 *   5. ECHO          the recovered words must appear NOWHERE in the transcript around the span:
 *                    more than maxEchoWords (2) CONSECUTIVE content words already present nearby
 *                    means the speech is in the transcript with the wrong timestamps, and a timing
 *                    defect is not a deletion. This condition was not designed, it was FORCED by
 *                    measurement: the first version of this detector, scored on segment extents,
 *                    reported eight deletions on one 92-minute channel and ALL EIGHT were mistimed
 *                    text that was present in the transcript all along — segments whose extents
 *                    stretched 20-30 s across silence. Word times fix that case; this condition
 *                    catches the same failure whatever produced it, including the extent fallback
 *                    and the repetition guard's own collapse (which extends a surviving segment's
 *                    end over a run it removed). Such a candidate is reported as `mistimed`, with
 *                    the reason, never as a deletion and never silently dropped.
 *
 * The five are independent: two are physical, one is lexical, one is a repeat experiment, one is a
 * text comparison against the artifact itself. A false alarm has to beat all five.
 *
 * AND THE WHOLE THING IS ONE-DIRECTIONAL, like the repetition guard's burst veto. The probe can
 * only ever CONFIRM a deletion the coverage stage already suspected; it can never mark a covered
 * span as deleted. So the detector is strictly more conservative than the coverage number, and the
 * failure mode it prefers is silence about a real deletion rather than noise about a real pause.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * COST — measured, not estimated, because a detector that must re-run the file is not shippable
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Nothing here re-transcribes anything. The burst grid is already computed by the pipeline for the
 * repetition guard's veto (0.68 s per 92-minute channel). Candidate generation is pure arithmetic
 * over data already in memory. Only the confirmed candidates are re-decoded, at most `maxProbes`
 * of them, longest first, as clips of a few seconds each — and all of them go through ONE
 * `whisper-cli` invocation, which takes `file0 file1 ...` and loads the model once. The measured
 * end-to-end addition on the 92-minute corpus is in the brief; the design bound is what matters
 * here: the probe budget is a hard cap, it is stated in the report, and a candidate that does not
 * fit inside it is reported as UNPROBED and never as a deletion.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE — enumerated here rather than discovered later
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   * PARTIAL deletion inside a covered burst. If the model emits some words over a burst and
 *     drops a clause within it, the burst is covered and this detector is blind. Coverage is a
 *     presence test, not a completeness test.
 *   * SUBSTITUTION. Words replaced by other words score as perfect coverage — `q5_0`'s 1,099-second
 *     collapse emitted 5,671 word tokens over the span it destroyed, so every burst there is
 *     "covered". Coverage and the repetition guard are complementary instruments and NEITHER is
 *     sufficient alone. Nothing in this pipeline yet measures word density against a physical
 *     speech budget, which is the instrument that would see it.
 *   * SPEECH BELOW THE BURST FLOOR. The grid is drawn at the channel's peak minus
 *     SPEECH_FLOOR_BELOW_PEAK_DB. Speech quieter than that produces no burst, so a deletion inside
 *     it produces no candidate. The floor is a channel-relative choice with a measured basis, not
 *     a guarantee.
 *   * DELETION HIDDEN BY A STRETCHED SEGMENT, when there are no word times. Coverage is scored on
 *     the emitted WORD wherever the segments carry `wordTimesMs` (whisper.cpp `-ojf` token offsets,
 *     which `transcribe.js` now always requests) and on the SEGMENT EXTENT otherwise. The extent
 *     fallback is bad in both directions and measured being bad — see `emittedWordTimes`. The report
 *     states which unit was used, every time, in `coverageUnit`; treat an `segment-extent` report as
 *     a weaker instrument, not an equal one.
 *   * A TIMING DEFECT. The transcript containing the right words at the wrong second is a real
 *     defect and this detector deliberately does NOT report it as a deletion (condition 5). It
 *     surfaces as a `mistimed` rejection in the report and nowhere else. Nothing in this pipeline
 *     yet audits timestamp accuracy.
 *   * SUB-SECOND LOSS. Out of scope by condition 1, above.
 *   * A SPAN THE MODEL ALSO REFUSES IN ISOLATION. If the isolated decode is empty too, the rule
 *     says NOT-SPEECH. A deletion that the model reproduces on the second attempt is beyond this
 *     method entirely, and no single-model method can be built that sees it.
 *   * ANYTHING WITHOUT A PROBE. No probe, no deletion — by construction. A pipeline that cannot cut
 *     or decode clips gets candidates and an honest `probed: 0`, never an alarm.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * PURE (no fs, no child_process), like `repetition-guard.js`, so the whole rule is node-testable on
 * fixtures. The two impure halves are injected by the pipeline and live where their tool already
 * lives: clip cutting + level measurement in `normalize.js` (ffmpeg), clip decoding in
 * `transcribe.js` (whisper). This module never touches either.
