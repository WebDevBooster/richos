/**
 * RichOS local service — pipeline stage 3: TRANSCRIBE (whisper.cpp, per channel).
 *
 * whisper.cpp (`whisper-cli`, Metal auto-on) is a native binary the service shells out to — the
 * precise reason the pipeline is not in the MV3 extension (the system architecture §4.1). Each channel
 * is transcribed independently, so every segment is ALREADY speaker-attributed by channel
 * (me / others) before the merge — no diarization model involved.
 *
 * The default model is whatever `config.js` DEFAULT_TIER resolves to — `large-v3-turbo-q5_0`
 * since 2026-09-10 (CEO decision page §10). It is NOT restated here, because a comment naming a
 * model is a second declaration of the default that no test can keep honest. Full turbo remains
 * selectable: `--tier turbo`, or `--model large-v3-turbo`.

/**
 * Per-token start offsets of one whisper.cpp segment, in ms — the model's OWN claim about where
 * its words are, present only when the run passed `-ojf` (`--output-json-full`).
 *
 * WHY THIS MATTERS AND WHY IT IS NOT OPTIONAL POLISH: the deletion detector
 * (`deletion-guard.js`) asks "did the run emit any word over this second of audio?", and a
 * whisper.cpp SEGMENT extent cannot answer it. Segments routinely stretch across the pauses around
 * them — measured on the 2026-08-29 corpus, one 30-second segment carried 8 words over 2.2 seconds
 * of actual speech, and 23-second segments carrying 6 words are ordinary. Score coverage on the
 * extent and the words get smeared across silence the speaker never filled, which invents
 * deletions where there are none. Score it on the token offsets and the same eight spans land
 * inside their bursts, correctly, every time.
 *
 * ONE TIME PER WORD, NOT PER TOKEN, and the difference is not cosmetic. whisper's vocabulary is
 * sub-word: a hyphenated compound arrives as several pieces, and a continuation piece carries its own
 * offset which can land well inside the following pause. Counting pieces therefore marks a burst
 * "covered" because the tail of the PREVIOUS word drifted into it. A word starts where whisper puts
 * a leading space; continuation pieces extend it and contribute no time of their own. This is the
 * same unit the 2026-08-29 coverage measurement used, and adopting it moved this pipeline's
 * detector from 6 of the 9 documented deletions to 8.
 *
 * `[_BEG_]` / `[_TT_nn]` are whisper's own structural markers, not words, and are dropped.

 * `'whisper.cpp (whisper-cli)'` — the same 24 characters for 1.9.1, for 1.8.3, for a build with
 * flash attention removed, and for anything else that prints the word "usage". Recorded against
 * every transcript, it could never disagree with itself, so no later reader could notice a change.

 * alone, and the structured form (`record.pipeline.toolchain`) carries the full hashes.
