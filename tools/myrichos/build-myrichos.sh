# build-myrichos.sh — materialize the CEO's central folder from the seed in this repository.
#
# WHAT THIS IS. `docs/plans/richos-central-folder-2026-09-06.md` §6 names the smallest useful
# first commit: the folder, the six `companies/<id>/company.md` files, and the six copied guard
# fragments. This script is how that folder comes into existence, and how it can be brought back
# if it is ever lost. It changes NO application behavior — nothing in `app/**` reads any of it
# yet. Every remaining step in that document is a wiring change with a target that now exists.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE PARENT DIRECTORY IS DECLARED ONCE, ON ONE LINE, AND NOWHERE ELSE.
#
# §8 open question 1: `~/myrichos` or `~/ab/myrichos`? Sage marked it `unverified:`, designed for
# `~/myrichos`, and said the choice is one line to change. It is the CEO's call and he has not
# been asked. So it is ONE LINE — the assignment below — and it is honored by every other file
# in this tool through substitution rather than repetition. No seed file names a parent. Changing
# his mind costs this line, or one invocation with MYRICHOS_ROOT set.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MYRICHOS_ROOT="${MYRICHOS_ROOT:-$HOME/myrichos}"

# The `richos` main checkout, for the ONE pointer that leaves this folder: the person-layer
# doctrine template, which is version-controlled and rendered by `doctrine.rs` and is therefore
# NOT copied here (§1.3 — the only copy stays where it is; this folder holds a checked pointer).
#
# It deliberately does NOT derive from this script's own location. A teammate runs this from a
# worktree that gets removed at land time, and a pointer into a removed worktree is precisely the
# dangling-symlink failure §1.3 exists to prevent. It defaults to the checkout the entity registry
# already names as a `richos` root.
RICHOS_ROOT="${RICHOS_ROOT:-$HOME/ab/richos}"

# WHY IT NEVER OVERWRITES. `myrichos` is the CEO's folder and §1.3 rules that it holds the ONLY
# copy of anything it holds. A seed that clobbered his edits would make this repository the real
# master and the folder a cache, which is the opposite of the design. So every write is
# create-if-absent. Re-running this is safe and is the intended way to add a company later.
#
# WHY THE GUARDS ARE COPIED RATHER THAN MOVED. §5.2 step 2: copy, do not move. The originals
# keep firing until step 4 has positively observed the replacements firing. During that window
# the copies are a deliberate, temporary second copy — the one exception to §1.3 — so each one
# is recorded in `guards/SOURCES` with its origin and its SHA-256, and `check-myrichos.sh`
# reports drift. A copy nobody can check is how the 13 stale forks in §3.2 happened.
